The size of a concept map, ie. the number of nodes and edges, is correlated to the size of its underlying text.
Also, the number of occurrences of a single concept in a given text is important for the degree of the corresponding node, ie. when a concept occurs only once in a given text, the corresponding node in the concept map will have a low degree.
On the other hand, when a concept occurs multiple times in a text, the degree of this concept will most likely increase.
These observations give rise to the question whether the size of the concept maps is correlated with the classification performance.
In this experiment we look at the classification scores of concept maps created from texts with varying length.
