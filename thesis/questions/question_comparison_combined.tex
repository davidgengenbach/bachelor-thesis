This question aims to directly test our hypothesis. 
When concept maps indeed have a structure that is useful for classification and when this structure is not captured by text-only approaches, the classification performance could increase when combining our graph- and text based approaches.
So, here we test the performance of combined text- and graph features by concatenating the vectors of both approaches and then training a classifier on these vectors.
We also compare these results with both text-only and graph-only approaches.
