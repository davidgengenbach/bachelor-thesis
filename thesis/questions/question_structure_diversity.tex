When the structure of the graphs is homogeneous or the structural differences are not distinct between graphs of different classes, the structure by itself will most likely not contribute to the classification performance.
When comparing the graph similarity under some graph kernel, the graphs of a given class should be distinguishable from the graphs of the other classes.

To understand the diversity in the structure of concept maps, we look at different metrics, eg. a histogram of the connected components per graph or the average node/edge ratio for each graph.
All these metrics aim to find out the diversity of the connectedness of concept maps.
There a lot of other metrics, but as we will see later on ,these metrics suffice to get a good picture about the structure of the concept maps.
