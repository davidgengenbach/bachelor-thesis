Another difference of concept maps to co-occurrence graphs is that the former have edge labels.
For this question we evaluate the importance and role of these edge labels in graph classification.
To make use of the edge label, we will also further introduce the linearized, or un-rolled, graph, ie. a graph converted into text.
