Concept map node labels often consist of more than one word which constitutes one of the differences to co-occurrence graphs and other graph text-representations.
Yet, our default approach, ie. the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel, does not leverage these multi-word labels.
So, for this questions we evaluate other approaches which make use of the multi-word labels and evaluate the usefulness of them.
This approach will later on also be used for the combined classification of text and graph features.
