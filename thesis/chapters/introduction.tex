\todo{Text classification is important. Why?}
\todo{Applications?}

\paragraph{Graph Classification}
Graph classification also grows in importance in many fields.
Graphs are a fitting representation for structured data.
Sequences like strings/text or trees can all be expressed intuitive as graphs.
\todo{Relationships between entities}

Following are some applications of graph classification:

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}
field & nodes & edges & classes \\
\midrule
chemistry & atoms & bonds & toxicity (binary) \\
biology & amino acids & spatial link & protein types \\ 
social networks & users & 'are friends' or 'like the same content' & bot detection (binary) or user classification
\end{tabular}
\end{figure}

As we will see later on, the graph classification task is also similar to the task of finding similar graphs for a given graph.

\labelsubsection{Hypothesis and Goals}{subsec:hypothesis_and_goals}
In this work, we evaluate the usefulness of graph representations of text in the context of text classification. In particular, we work out how or whether the structure of so-called concept maps actually improve the classification performance.
We will introduce concept maps in the next section.

The main hypothesis of this work is:
\begin{quote}
Concept maps capture structural information about the underlying text. Mining this structural information in the context of text-classification leads to an improved classification score.
\end{quote}

There are a great number of approaches for text classification, a lot of them based on counting the words of a text and comparing word frequencies with the frequencies in other texts in the dataset.

\todo{Why could graph classification be useful? Why not only use non-structural data for classification? What are the disadvantages of non-structural representations?}
