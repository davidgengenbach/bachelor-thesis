\todo[inline]{Applications also}

\paragraph{Text Classification}
Text classification has a great number of applications.

Not limited to spam detection, genre classification or sentiment analysis.

\paragraph{Graph Classification}
Graph classification also grows in importance in many fields.
Graphs are a fitting representation for structured data.
Sequences like strings/text or trees can all be expressed intuitively as graphs.
\todo[inline]{Relationships between entities}

Following are some applications of graph classification:

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}
field & nodes & edges & classes \\
\midrule
chemistry & atoms & bonds & toxicity (binary) \\
biology & amino acids & spatial link & protein types \\ 
social networks & users & 'are friends' or 'like the same content' & bot detection (binary) or user classification
\end{tabular}
\end{figure}

As we will see later on, the graph classification task is also similar to the task of finding similar graphs for a given graph.

\labelsubsection{Hypothesis and Goals}{subsec:hypothesis_and_goals}
In this work, we evaluate the usefulness of graph representations of text in the context of text classification. In particular, we work out how or whether the structure of the graph representation actually improves the classification performance.
For this, we first create graph representations for set of texts and then evaluate the graph classification performance.

The main hypothesis of this work is:
\begin{quote}
Concept maps capture structural information about the underlying text. Mining this structural information in the context of text-classification leads to an improved classification score.
\end{quote}
