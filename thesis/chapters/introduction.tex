\refsubsection{Applications}{subsec:applications}
\paragraph{Text Classification}
Text classification has a great number of applications.

Not limited to spam detection, genre classification or sentiment analysis.

\paragraph{Graph Classification}
Graph classification also has a growing importance in many fields. Graphs are a fitting representation for structured data. Following are some examples of graph classification:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}
field &  nodes &  edges & classes\\
\midrule
chemistry & atoms & bonds & toxicity (binary)\\
biology & amino acids & spatial link & protein types \\ 
social networks & users & 'are friends' or 'like the same content' & bot detection (binary) or user classification
\end{tabular}
\end{figure}

\refsubsection{Hypothesis and Goals}{subsec:hypothesis_and_goals}
In this work, we evaluate the usefulness of graph representations of text in the context of text classification. In particular, we work out how or whether the structure of the graph representation actually improves the classification performance.
For this, we evaluate the classification performance of different graph types like co-occurrence graphs or concept maps.

The main hypothesis of this work is:
\begin{quote}
Concept maps capture structural information about the underlying text. Mining this structural information in the context of text-classification leads to an improved classification score.
\end{quote}
