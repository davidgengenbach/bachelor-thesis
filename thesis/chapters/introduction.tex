\refsubsection{Hypothesis and Goals}{subsec:hypothesis_and_goals}
In this work, we evaluate the usefulness of graph representation of text in the context of text classification. In particular, we work out how or whether the structure of the graph representation actually improves the classification performance.

The main hypothesis is:
\begin{quote}
Concept maps capture structural information about the underlying text. Mining this structural information in the context of text-classification leads to an improved classification score.
\end{quote}

\refsubsection{Applications}{subsec:applications}
Text classification has a great number of applications. Not limited to spam detection, genre classification or sentiment analysis.

\todo{Graph classification also important.}
