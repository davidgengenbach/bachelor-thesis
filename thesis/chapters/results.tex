\subsubsection{Structure Of The Used Graphs}
The co-occurrence graphs have a relatively simple structure.
Co-occurrence graphs are always connected, ie. the number of connected components is 1 (or 0 in case of an empty graph).
When the window size is 1, the graph is similar to a path, meaning that most of the nodes have a degree $< 2$. With increasing window size, the graph gets more connected.
