Text classification is an important natural language processing task. 
Here, finding appropriate representations for text content is crucial and directly influences the success in solving the task.
While state-of-the-art count-based representations like Bag-Of-Words perform well on numerous tasks, they often go hand-in-hand with structural information loss of their underlying text, eg. the semantic or syntax.
While one can augment these count-based representations to partially solve these issues, in this work, we instead explore another, more structured text representation, namely concept maps or concept graphs.
Automatically generated concept maps have successfully been employed to summarize text and therefor might capture important concepts and their relations.
This work explores whether and how one can harness this structural information in the context of text classification.
For this, we utilize different graph kernel-based approaches to extract features from the concept maps and examine their usefulness in conjunction with conventional text classification approaches.
