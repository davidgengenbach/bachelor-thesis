1)
    Main hypothesis
        Concept Maps capture structures of the underlying text that are useful in the context of text classification.
2)
    Subgoal
        How diverse is the structure of the concept maps? How big are the connected components in the graphs?
    Hypothesis
        The structure is relatively simple. Disconnected graphs with connected components having a low number of vertices
    Methodology
        1) Create histogram of number of connected components
        2) Create histogram of size of connected components
    Result
        ?
    Discussion
        Maybe the simple structure is due to the low number of sentences in the documents. No cross-references.
3)
    Subgoal
        How important is the structure of the concept maps, compared to the content (= the labels)?
    Hypothesis
        The structure is not that important. 
    Methodology
        1)
            Compare
                1) Results with the graph linearized, then simple CountVectorizer/TfIdfVectorizer
                2) Results of WL
            Compare
                1) Results of WL with labels
                2) Results of WL without labels
        2)
            Look at change in WL phi feature maps with different iterations

4)
    Subgoal
        How useful are the concept maps combined with conventional text classification?
    Hypothesis
        ?
    Methodology
        1) Train SVM with combined features
        2) Look at the importance of each feature range (text, wl iteration 1, wl iteration 2)

5)
    Subgoal
        How does the classification of co-occurrence graph compare to concept maps?
    Hypothesis
        Co-occurrence graphs perform better due to the sheer number of labels in them. Concept maps have a compression factor of 0.0X%, thus 
    Methodology
        Compare f1 score of
