van hout , angeliek ; event semantic of verb frame alternation : a case study of dutch and it acquisition ; 0-8153 - 3128 - 2 , cloth ; page , $ 91 ; garland publish ; outstand dissertation in linguistic using both theoretical and language acquisition argument , this study propose a new model of the lexicon-syntax interface define in term of check event-semantic feature . the research be base on dutch verb and their possible verb frame ( intransitive , transitive , etc . ) and two study of child 's dutch . the model develop from these case represent more generally the way in which universal grammar organize the lexicon of a language and the map system that associate a verb 's lexical feature with its syntactic projection . the author show that a predicate 's event-semantic or aspectual property define the map relation between lexicon and syntax , rather than lexical-semantic information of the verb 's event participant , which be the more traditional view . a verb 's appearance in several different verb frame be determine by event type-shift ; an atelic ( = unbound ) or a telic ( = bound ) event type yield different verb frame , and so do a non-causative or a causative event type . these effect can only be capture if the map relation be sensitive to event semantics . the two acquisition study offer a new and unique perspective on verb learn . one be a longitudinal study on the acquisition of light verb ; the other be an experimental study on the acquisition of intransitive verb . they show that child be sensitive to event semantics from early in the language acquisition process . e - mail : info @ garland . com
