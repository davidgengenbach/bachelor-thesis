Subject: call : neural symbolic process

nips * 98 conference workshop ( part of international conference on neural information process system ) december 4 and 5 , 1998 breckenridge , colorado hybrid neural symbolic integration - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - stefan wermter , university of sunderland , uk ron sun , university of alabama , usa description and motivation - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - in the past it be very controversial whether neural or symbolic approach alone will be sufficient to provide a general framework for intelligent process . in recent year , the field of hybrid neural symbolic process have see a remarkable development . the motivation for the integration of symbolic and neural model of cognition and intelligent behavior come from many different source . > from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience , a symbolic interpretation of an artificial neural network architecture be desirable , since the brain have a neuronal structure and the capability to perform symbolic process . this lead to the question how different process mechanism can bridge the large gap between , for instance , acoustic or visual input signal and symbolic reason for instance for language process , inference , etc . > from the perspective of knowledge-base process , hybrid neural / symbolic representation be advantageous , since different mutually complementary property can be integrate . symbolic representation have advantage with respect to easy interpretation , explicit control , fast initial code , dynamic variable bind and knowledge abstraction . on the other hand , neural representation show advantage for gradual analog plausibility , learn , robust fault-tolerant process , and generalization to similar input . since these advantage be mutually complementary , a hybrid symbolic connectionist architecture can be useful if different process strategy have to be support . area of interest - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - integration of symbolic and neural technique for - integrate technique for language and speech process - integrate different mode of reason and inference - combine different technique in datum mine - integration for vision , language , multimedium - hybrid technique in knowledge base system - combine fuzzy / neuro technique - neural / symbolic technique and application in engineer - exploratory research in - emergent symbolic behavior base on neural network - interpretation and explanation of neural network - knowledge extraction from neural network - various form of interact knowledge representation - dynamic system and recurrent network - evolutionary technique for cognitive task ( language , reason , etc ) - autonomous learn system for cognitive agent that utilize both neural and symbolic learn technique format - - - - - the workshop should provide a forum for present and discuss theory and practice of neural / symbolic integration . the format will consist of position statement / panel , group discussion and individual paper presentation . we intend to reserve a significant portion of time for open discussion . the propose length of the workshop be two day . suggest panel be : 1 . connectionist model for language , vision , inference . what be principle for neural / symbolic representation ? 2 . hybrid neural model for new media ( multimedium , web search , digital library , etc ) what will be the impact of hybrid technique in the future ? submission - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - it be intend to publish the result after the workshop , either in a book ( springer ) or vium a special issue of a journal . we invite papers which can take two form : short position papers ( around 4 page ) or full papers ( up to 12 page ) . we intend to process submission electronically . please a postscript file vium ftp ( see below ) . the paper format should be compatible with latex article format : 11pt , 12 page maximum , include title , address and email address , abstract , figure , reference . notification will be send by email to the first author . postscript file can be upload with anonymous ftp . please send a notification message to stefan . wermter @ sunderland . ac . uk ftp isis . sunderland . ac . uk ( 157 . 228 . 12 . 13 ) login : anonymous password : < your email address > cd pub / wermter binary put < yourfile . p > or < yourfile . p . gz > quit the paper must arrive not later than 25th september 1998 at the address below . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # submission deadline : 25th september 1998 for an update on invite speaker , panel and information please see http : / / osiri . sunderland . ac . uk / ~ cs0stw / wermter / workshop / nips-workshop . html please send correspondence to : nips workshop contact - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * professor stefan wermter research chair in intelligent system university of sunderland school of compute & information system st peter way sunderland sr6 0dd unite kingdom phone : + 44 191 515 3279 fax : + 44 191 515 2781 email : stefan . wermter @ sunderland . ac . uk http : / / osiri . sunderland . ac . uk / ~ cs0stw / * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
