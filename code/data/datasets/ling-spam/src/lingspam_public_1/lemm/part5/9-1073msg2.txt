( http : / / www . c . ucy . ac . cy / sac99 . html ) sac ' 99 : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ over the past thirteen year , the acm symposium on apply compute ( sac ) have become a primary forum for apply computer scientist and application developer from around the world to interact and present their work . sac ' 99 be sponsor by the acm special interest group sigada , sigapp , sigbio , and sigcue . author be invite to contribute original papers in all area of experimental compute and application development for the technical session . there will be a number of special track on such issue as program language , parallel and distribute compute , mobile and scientific compute , internet and the www , etc . coordination model , language and application track : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ a special track on coordination model , language and application will be hold at sac ' 99 . the term " coordination " here be use in a rather broad sense cover traditional model and language ( e . g . one base on the share dataspace and cham metaphor ) but also other relate formalism such as configuration and architectural description framework , system model abstraction and language , program skeleton , etc . this track on coordination be hold for the second time as part of acm sac 's event . the cfp for the acm sac ' 98 track attract 33 submission from 18 country ; 8 of those submission be accept as regular papers and 4 more as short papers . major topic of interest include but be not limit to the follow : * novel model , language , program and implementation technique . * relationship with other computational model such as object orient , declarative ( functional , logic , constraint ) program or extension of them with coordination capability . * application ( especially where the industry be involve ) . * theoretical aspect ( semantics , reason , verification ) . * software architecture and software engineer technique . * middleware platform ( e . g . corba ) . * all aspect relate to the model of information system ( groupware , internet and the web , workflow management , cscw ) . track program chair : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ george a . papadopoulo department of computer science university of cyprus 75 kallipoleo str . , p . o . b . 537 cy-1678 , nicosium , cyprus e - mail : george @ c . ucy . ac . cy tel : + 357 2 338705 / 6 , fax : + 357 2 339062 guideline for submission : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ original papers from the above-mention or other relate area will be consider . this include three category of submission : 1 ) original and unpublish research ; 2 ) report of innovative compute application in the art , science , engineer , business , government , education and industry ; and 3 ) report of successful technology transfer to new problem domain . each submit paper will be fully referee and undergo a blind review process by at least three referee . the accept papers in all category will be publish in the acm sac ' 99 proceedings . there will also be a special issue of the journal of program language , chapman & hall ( http : / / www . chapmanhall . com / jp / default . html ) with expand version of select papers from those that will be accept for this special track as regular papers . submission guideline must be strictly follow : * submit six ( 6 ) copy of original manuscript to the sac ' 99 coordination model , language and application track program chair ( address show above ) . alternatively , submit your paper electronically in uuencode compress postscript format ; this be strongly encourage . fax submission will not be accept . * the author ( s ) name ( s ) and address ( e ) must not appear in the body of the paper , and self-reference should be in the third person . this be to facilitate blind review . * the body of the paper should not exceed 5 , 0 word ( approximately 15 page , double-space ) . * a separate cover sheet ( in the case of electronic submission this should be send separately from the main paper ) should show the title of the paper , the author ( s ) name ( s ) and affiliation ( s ) , and the address ( include e-mail , telephone , and fax ) to which correspondence should be send . * all submission must be receive by august 17 , 1998 . anyone wish to review papers for this special track should contact the track program chair at the address show above . important date : ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ * august 17 , 1998 : paper submission . * october 15 , 1998 : author notification . * december 1 , 1998 : camera - ready copy .
