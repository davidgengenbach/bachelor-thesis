cole - acl ' 98 workshop multilingual information management : current levels and future abilities august 16 , 1998 universite de montreal montreal / canada the cole / acl workshop on multilingual information management be a follow-on to an nsf - sponsor workshop hold in conjunction with the first international conference on language resource and evaluation in granada , spain ( may 1998 ) . the goal of the workshop be to consider the recent history and likely near-term future of a number of research area pertain to language that be relate ( but still semi-independent at present ) . the conclusion have be gather into a report , to be submit to the nsf , le , and other fund agency in europe and north america , for their consideration in set fund policy and goal . the draft report is now available at http : / / www . c . cmu . edu / ~ ref / mlim / at the granada workshop , an international panel of invite expert focus on a set of question in an attempt to identify the most likely and most effective future direction of computational linguistics research - especially in the context of the need to handle multi-lingual and multus - modal information . the coling workshop , a follow-on , have the aim of open the discussion to the computational linguistics community as a whole , to solicit the comment , addition , feedback , and contribution of everyone . to register , consult the coling / acl home page at http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / workshop description the development of natural language application which handle multus - lingual and multi-modal information be the next major challenge face the field of computational linguistics . over the past 50 year , a variety of language-relate capability have be develop in area such as machine translation , information retrieval , and speech recognition , together with core capability such as information extraction , summarization , parse , generation , multimedium plan and integration , statistics-base method , ontology , lexicon construction and lexical representation , and grammar . the next few year will require the extension of these technology to encompass multi-lingual and multi-modal information . extend current technology will require integration of the various capability into multi-functional natural language system . however , there be today no clear vision of how these technology could or should be assemble into a coherent framework . what would be involve in connect a speech recognition system to an information retrieval engine , and then use machine translation and summarization software to process the retrieve text ? how can traditional parse and generation be enhance with statistical technique ? what would be the effect of carefully craft lexicon on traditional information retrieval ? the workshop be organize as a series of discussion session , each one devote to one aspect of computational language , initiate by a report of the discussion at the granada workshop ( a report summarize the discussion at granada be available ; see below ) . enough time for discussion have be schedule . the discussion will focus on the follow fundamental question : 1 . what be the current level of capability in each of the major area of the field deal with language and relate media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these function be integrate in the near future , and what kind of system will result ? 3 . what be the major consideration for extend these function to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrate system of the type envision in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these question in relation to the follow area : o multi-lingual resource ( lexicon , ontology , corpus , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation , of text and speech o automate ( cross-lingual ) information extraction and summarization o method and technique ( both statistics-base and linguistics-base ) o speech recognition and synthesis o multimedium communication , as well as language and speaker identification o evaluation and assessment technique for each of these area o government policy for future fund the initial finding of the report will form the basis of the discussion . the draft report be now available at http : / / www . c . cmu . edu / ~ ref / mlim / major point raise in the discussion will be record and include in the report . we eagerly seek your feedback , comment , contribution , and assistance , to make this report as comprehensive and as accurate as possible ! program 9 : 0 - 9 : 10 welcome and overview 9 : 10 - 9 : 55 cross - lingual and cross - modal information retrieval moderator : judith klavan 9 : 55 - 10 : 40 information extraction and automate text summarization moderator : eduard hovy 10 : 40 - 11 : 0 break 11 : 0 - 11 : 45 method and technique moderator : nancy ide 11 : 45 - 12 : 30 machine translation of text and speech moderator : bente maegaard 12 : 30 - 2 : 0 lunch 2 : 0 - 2 : 45 multilingual resource moderator : martha palmer 2 : 45 - 3 : 30 speech recognition and synthesis moderator : tba 3 : 30 - 4 : 0 break 4 : 0 - 4 : 45 evaluation and assessment moderator : john white 4 : 45 - 5 : 30 multimedium communication and language / speaker identification moderator : oliviero stock 5 : 30 - 6 : 0 government : development policy and fund moderator : antonio zampollus the report the outcome of the granada and montreal workshop be a report , originally commission by the nsf , to be submit to the nsf , le , and other fund agency in europe and north america . the first draft of the report is available at http : / / www . c . cmu . edu / ~ ref / mlim / we eagerly seek your feedback , comment , contribution , and assistance in make this report as comprehensive and as accurate as possible ! organizers robert frederk center for machine translation carnegie - mellon university schenley park pittsburgh , pa 15213-3890 tel : + 1-412 - 268-6656 fax : + 1-412 - 268-6298 email : ref @ nl . c . cmu . edu eduard hovy information science institute of the university of southern californium 4676 admiralty way marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 tel : + 1-310 - 822-1511 fax : + 1-310 - 823-6714 email : hovy @ isus . edu nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , ny 12604-0520 usa tel : + 1-914 - 437 5988 fax : + 1-914 - 437 7498 email : ide @ c . vassar . edu joseph marianus limsi-cnrs bp 133 91403 orsay cedex france tel : + 33 - 1-69 - 85-8085 fax : + 33 - 1-69 - 85-8088 email : marianus @ limsus . fr antonio zampollus ilc-cnr via dellum faggiolum 32 56100 pisa italy fax : + 39-50 - 556285 email : pisa @ ilc . pi . cnr . it - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - eduard hovy email : hovy @ isus . edu usc information science institute tel : 310-822 - 1511 ext 731 4676 admiralty way fax : 310-823 - 6714 marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 project homepage : http : / / www . isus . edu / natural-language / nlp-at - isus . html
