overt movement , whether head-movement or xp - movement , be force to apply to morphologically support the suffixal functional head . this claim automatically lead to derive the absence of overt movement in consistently head-final language like japanese from their word order . the propose analysis not only provide principle answer for the fundamental question with overt movement , but eliminate one of the most problematic aspect of the minimalist program , the strong / weak distinction among functional head . chapter 4 discuss various implication and consequence of the propose analysis for overt movement , phrase structure , the computational system , and typological variation . chapter 5 discuss overt np - raise as overt movement indirectly drive by the morphological property of agr . it be claim that a subject in nominative-accusative language overtly raise not to directly support agr , but to provide f-feature for agr so that it can be successfully suffix to a verb as the overt realization of the f-feature of an np . from this , asymmetry between overt np - raise and other overt movement directly drive by morphology naturally follow . also available : > uci dissertation in linguistic griffith , teresa a . 1996 project transitivity and agreement takano , yujus 1996 movement and parametric variation in syntax zoerner , cyril edward 1995 coordination : the syntax of &p us $ 14 each , plus ship and handle > uci work paper in linguistic , volume 3 ( 1997 ) . edite by luther > chen - sheng liu and kazue takeda article appear in the third volume be : brian agbayanus : category raise , adjunction , and minimality lisa laus - shen cheng : " partial " wh - movement naokus fukuus : attract and the a - over - a principle toru ishius : the " cross " constraint and the minimal link condition luther chen - sheng liu : light verb and accusative - ing gerund in taiwanese yujus takano : object shift as short scramble kazue takeda : a note on locality of category movement and feature movement sze - wing tang : the parametric approach to the resultative construction in chinese and english miyoko yashuus : identification of ellipse and other empty category us $ 14 , plus ship and handle > uci work paper in linguistic , volume 2 : proceeding of the south > western optimality theory workshop ( swot ii ) . edite by brian agbayanus > and naomus harada us $ 12 , plus ship and handle > uci work paper in linguistic , volume 1 . edite by brian agbayanus , > kazue takeda and sze - wing tang us $ 12 , plus ship and handle ship and handle ( per item ) domestic : $ 5 ;
