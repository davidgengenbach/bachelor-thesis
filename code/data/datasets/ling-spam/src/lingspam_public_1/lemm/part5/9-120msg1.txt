4 april 1998 . sixteen invite speaker from britain and abroad will give papers . no attempt will be make to achieve a comprehensive coverage of language contact in the ancient mediterranean world , but the focus will instead be on greek and latin in contact both with each other and with other language . it be intend that some papers should be linguistic in orientation ( i . e . that they should take account of recent research by linguist on bilingualism in modern society , relate the finding if possible to issue of ancient bilingualism ) , but it be also obvious that historian and literary scholar commonly address problem relate to language contact . we hope that the programme of papers will offer a combination of sociolinguistic , literary , cultural and historical approach to the subject . conference program thursday , april 2 12 . 0 -
