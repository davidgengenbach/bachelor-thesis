acl ' 99 call for paper 37th annual meet of the association for computational linguistic 20 - - 26 june , 1999 university of maryland [ you may find it easier to read this information on the web at http : / / www . mrus . mq . edu . au / conf / acl99 ] 1 . paper session 1 . 1 topic of interest in a break with tradition , at this year 's acl conference we be experiment with a new format . the technical session of the conference will be of two kind . there will be general session of the kind that have form the conference programme in the past ; however , there will also be a number of special thematic session , somewhat like a special issue of a journal , organise around theme propose by member of the computational linguistics community . our aim be to incorporate some of the intensity and excitement of the traditional post-conference workshop , without replace those workshop . the conference structure will mean that the thematic session will run as parallel session , result in smaller and more focus audience . when you submit a paper to the conference , you will need to consider whether you want to present the paper in the general session or in one of the thematic session , which be list below . for the general session , papers be invite on substantial , original , and unpublish research on all aspect of computational linguistics , include , but not limit to : pragmatic , discourse , semantics , syntax and the lexicon ; phonetics , phonology and morphology ; interpret and generate speak and write language ; linguistic , mathematical and psychological model of language ; language-orient information retrieval and information extraction ; corpus-base language model ; machine translation and translation aid ; natural language interface and dialogue system ; approach to coordinate the linguistic with other modality in multi-medium system ; message and narrative understand system . paper submit to the thematic session be more narrowly target at specific topic . the complete list of thematic session be as follow ; further information about each can be find at the indicate url . d1 : dialogue management in interactive spoken dialogue system chair : diane litman and marilyn walker motivation : the advent of real-time interactive speak dialogue system pose special challenge for dialogue management . topic : evaluation , dialogue strategy , repair , system integration , learn / optimize system behavior , corpus analysis , robust process , and the requirement dialogue place on generation , speech recognition and synthesis . http : / / www . research . att . com / ~ diane / acl99 - theme . html d2 : discourse tagge : use , result and application chair : marilyn walker , julium hirschberg and owen rambow motivation : empirical approach to discourse process often rely on tag text or dialogue with discourse tag from a wide range of tag set . topic : discourse tag for train or test model of discourse structure , reference , translation , speech act , topic identification , and speech recognition . http : / / www . research . att . com / ~ walker / dtag-acl 99 . html d3 : corpus - base approach to discourse and dialogue chair : nancy ide this theme treat corpus-base work on any aspect of discourse and dialogue analysis , include co-reference , segmentation , discourse structure , parse , generation , etc . , especially in the light of relevance to practical application . http : / / www . c . vassar . edu / ~ ide / call / acl99 - discourse . html d4 : lexicon and discourse : connection through structure and semantic chair : laurence danlo , alistair knott , and bonnie webber motivation : with the lexicon become a central resource for compute property of the sentence , one may consider similar gain for compute property of discourse . topic : lexical semantics of discourse connective and focus particle , discourse and lexical interpretation , lexicalize grammar for discourse . http : / / www . cogscus . ed . ac . uk / ~ alik / acltheme . html i1 : nlp technique for cross - language information retrieval chair : dougla oard motivation : system that use query or example in one natural language to find text or speech in another be become increasingly important . topic : nlp technique for query translation , cognate match and interlingual match technique , cross-language gist use summarization or gloss translation . http : / / www . cli . umd . edu / conference / acl99clir / i2 : explore the limit of shallow parse chair : gregory grefenstette shallow parse technique provide a partial analysis of the syntactic structure . theme cover research into : quantify identifiable linguistic phenomenon in a corpus ;
