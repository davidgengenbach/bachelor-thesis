schwenter , scott a . ; pragmatic of conditional mark : implicature , scalarity , and exclusivity ; 0-8153 - 3309 - 9 , cloth ; page 275 , $ 63 ; garland publish ; outstand dissertation in linguistic this study examine the mean of prototypical conditional-sentence marker like english if and spanish si from a primarily pragmatic perspective . it argue that the sense of " hypotheticality " often associate with the encode semantics of such marker be actually a pragmatic conversational implicature that be cancelable in certain discourse context . the analysis therefore redraw in radical fashion the semantics-pragmatic boundary as it apply to the mean of conditional marker . a number of key implication be present in detail . first , it be show that " factual " if-clause , typically consider anomalous despite their frequent occurrence in many type of discourse , fall out from the prediction make by the pragmatic view of conditional marker mean . second , it be demonstrate that the " hypotheticality " implicature interact with the well-known implicature of conditional perfection , and that this interaction allow one to predict when " biconditional " reading of simple conditional will and will not arise . more generally , the model of mean develop in this book permit clear link to be make between conditionality and other conceptual domain , such as adversativity and scalarity . these link be examine in chapter 4 and 5 use declarative-sentence use of spanish si as the empirical test grind . this book will be of interest to linguist work in semantics and pragmatic , discourse analysis , and hispanic linguistics . it will also appeal to scholar interest in the interface between communication and cognition . e - mail : info @ garland . com
