first announcement and call for paper ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ esslli-99 workshop on the generation of nominal expression university of utrecht , the netherland 9-13 august 1999 context : the workshop will take place in association with the 11th european summer school " logic linguistic and information " ( esslli ) , to be hold in utrecht , the netherland , from 9-20 august 1999 . the format of the workshop be 5 x 90 minute on the 5 consecutive day of 9 to 13 august 1999 . the esslli summer school be organize under the auspices of the european association for logic , language and information ( folli ) . previous esslli summer school have be highly successful , attract around 500 student from europe and elsewhere . the school have develop into an important meet place and forum for discussion for student and researcher interest in the interdisciplinary study of logic , language and information . for more information see http : / / essllus . let . uu . nl . workshop description : if someone attempt to assess the ` state of the art ' of linguistic research on nominal expression by look at how present-day program generate nominal , he or she would no doubt underestimate gravely the level of sophistication of theoretical work on nominal . it can be argue that this be because exist work on the computational generation of nominal have limit itself to relatively simple nominal , often focus on simple ( singular ) definite description and pronoun . alternatively , it may be contend that much of the theoretical work in this area be not mature enough to be appicable in generation . be this as it may , work on the generation of nominal have not profite much from theoretical research in formal semantics and psycholinguistic on the mean , interpretation and production of nominal expression . this workshop will try to bridge the gap between theory and practice in this area by focus on the generation of nominal expression of different linguistic type include , for example , indefinite and quantificational nps ( of different monotonicity type ) . the theme of the workshop be closely relate to that of a number of ongo research project , include the gnome ( ` generation of nominal expression ' ) project , in which the itri ( brighton ) and hcrc ( edinburgh / durham ) collaborate , and which be fund by the epsrc in the unite kingdom . topic for which submission be invite include : ( 1 ) the influence of discourse context on the appropriateness and interpretation of a nominal expression ( 2 ) descriptive issue concern the treatment of plurality , bridge , aggregation , eventuality , reference to text , cross-modal reference , etc . ( 3 ) representational issue ( i . e . , what kind of mean representation should form the input to the generation algorithm ? ) ( 4 ) reversibility of grammar ( 5 ) difference in textual style or ` genre ' ( 6 ) psycholinguistic research relevant to computational natural language generation ( nlg ) ( 7 ) corpus - base work lead to insight relevant for computational nlg ( 8 ) issue of system / algorithm evaluation . practical issue : we welcome short ( i . e . , roughly 1000-1500 word ) electronic submission ( send email to rodger . kibble @ itrus . brighton . ac . uk ) on the theme of the workshop . submission should be in postscript or plain ascius . please include " esslli99 " in the subject line of your message to make thing easy for us . in accordance with the description of the workshop description , we encourage submission about theoretical ( e . g . , formal semantic or psycholinguistic ) , apply , or corpus-base work , as long as the work be clearly relevant for nlg program . no matter what they consider the main focus of their work , we ask author to * stress relevance for nlg * in their submission ( and , later , in their presentation ) . this will ensure that all contribution will contain a common ` core ' , notwithstand their difference in perspective . it be esslli 's practice to make sure that workshop go ahead only if there turn out to be a sufficient level of interest , base on quantity and quality of submission . workshop speaker be require to register for the summer school ; however , workshop speaker will be able to register at a reduce rate to be determine by the organize committee . limit fund be available to contribute to speaker ' expense in exceptional circumstance . important date : - first call for papers : 22 october 1998 - deadline for submission of abstract : 1 march 1999 - notification of acceptance : 1 may 1999 - workshop to be hold : august 9-13 for any question , please contact the organizer or consult our web page at < http : / / www . itrus . brighton . ac . uk / project / gnome / esslli99 . html > which will shortly be available . rodger kibble & kee van deemter information technology research institute ( itri ) university of brighton lewe road , watt build brighton bn2 4gj unite kingdom email : rodger . kibble @ itrus . brighton . ac . uk kee . van . deemter @ itrus . brighton . ac . uk fax : + 44 1273 642908
