pkdd ' 98 - - 2nd european symposium on principle of data mine and knowledge discovery nante , france september 23-26 , 1998 http : / / www . science . univ-nant . fr / pkdd98 data mine and knowledge discovery in database ( kdd ) have emerge from acombination of many research area : database , statistics , machinelearn , automate scientific discovery , inductive logic program , artificial intelligence , visualization , decision science , and high performance compute . while each of these area can contribute in specific way , kdd focus on the value that be add by creative combination of the contribute area . the goal of pkdd ' 98 be to provide a european - base forum for interaction among all theoretician and practitioner interest in datum mine . interdisciplinary collaboration be one desire outcome , but the main long-term focus be on theoretical principle for the emerge discipline of kdd , especially on kdd - specific principle that go beyond each contribute area . both theoretical and apply submission be seek . reviewer will assess the contribution toward the principle of kdd , in addition to the usual requirement of relevance , novelty , clarity and significance . apply papers should go beyond an individual application , present an explicit method that promise a degree of generality within one or more stage of the discovery process , such as preprocess , mine , visualization , use of prior knowledge , knowledge refinement , and evaluation . theoretical papers should demonstrate how the propose theoretical contribution advance the discovery process . the follow non-exclusive list exemplify topic of interest : data and knowledge representation for datum mine * beyond relational database : new form of datum organization * data reduction * prior domain knowledge and use of discover knowledge * combine query system with discovery capability statistic and probability in datum mine * discovery of probabilistic network * model knowledge uncertainty * discovery of exception and deviation * statistical significance in large-scale search * the problem of over-fit logic - base perspective on datum mine * inference of knowledge from datum * explore different subspace of first order logic * rough set in datum mine * boolean approach to datum mine * inductive logic program for mine real database * pattern - recognition for datum mine * the use of tolerance ( similarity ) relation in datum mine * kdd - motivate discretization of datum * discovery of approximate scheme of reason from datum man - machine interaction in datum mine * visualization of datum * visualization of knowledge * interface design * interactive datum mine : human and computer contribution artificial intelligence contribution to kdd * represent knowledge and hypothesis space * search for knowledge and its complexity * combine many method in one system * data mine in distribute / multiagent system high performance compute for datum mine * hardware support for kdd * parallel discovery algorithm and complexity * distribute datum mine * scalability in high dimensional dataset * from concept learn to concept discovery * expand the autonomy of machine learner * embed learn method in kdd system * conceptual cluster in knowledge discovery * application of scientific discovery system to database * scientific hypothesis evaluation that transfer to kdd * hypothesis space of scientific discovery apply in kdd * difference between the datum handle in both field * kdd application on scientific database * decomposition of large datum table quality assessment of datum mine result * multus - criterion knowledge evaluation * benchmark and metric for system evaluation * statistical test in kdd application * usefulness and risk assessment in decision-make application of datum mine and knowledge discovery * medicine : diagnosis and prognosis * control theory : predictive and adaptive control , model identification * engineer : diagnosis of mechanism and process * public administration * market and finance * data mine on the web in text and heterogeneous datum * natural and social science * prediction and intervention use of knowledge * fraud detection interaction between symbolic kdd method and neural net * interpretation of knowledge accumulate in a train nn * hybrid nn / symbolic kdd system * nn architecture for higher transparency and interpretability submit papers should be in english and not exceed 10 single-space page of 12pt font ( exclude title page but include table , figure and bibliography ) . submission exceed this limit will not be review . a separate title page should begin with title , author , affiliation , surface and e-mail address , and an abstract of about 200 word . submit papers should preferably be format accord to the lnai guideline . latex and word style file be available at http : / / www . science . univ-nant . fr / pkdd98 / style . the follow item must be submit by may 15th , 1998 : an electronic version of the paper ( uuencode and compress postscript ) , and an electronic version of the titlepage in plain ascii format . four hard copy of the paper by regular mail be also accept if electronic submission be not possible . all item should be send to the follow address : * regular mail : mohame quafafou - pkdd ' 98 conference ( see full address below ) * electronic mail : pkdd98 @ irin . univ-nant . fr all accept for regular and poster presentation will be publish by springer verlag as part of the ` ` lecture note in artificial intelligence ' ' ( lnai ) series . important dates -
