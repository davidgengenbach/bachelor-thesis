Subject: whole and their part

whole and their part ( w / p ) bolzano , maretsch castle , 17-19 june 1998 1 . presentation science be connect to the complementarity of analysis and synthesis . it may be say that classical physics be characterize by an in-built analysis of the world into constituent part ( such as atom or elementary particle ) . these be then recompose together to provide , by means of synthesis , any system ; interaction be linearly and locally describe ; the result hierarchy of structure be ground on such constituent part . in contemporary science , the age of " pure " analysis seem to have end . there be deep mathematical reason for this . non - linear system have property that , in general , cannot be express in term of decomposition into ultimate , unstructure , pointlike part plus a suitable set of relation among them . moreover , the " dialectic " of quantity and quality be subtler than be previously think and this dialectic be need in the explanation of all sort of phenomenon . it arise not only in physics , but also in the study of cognitive system and natural and program language . within psychology , it be say that " gestalten " be cohesive whole and that " the whole be more than the sum of its part " . but what do this mean exactly ? similar question emerge in other context as well . what be relevant for the foundation of science , the need for a clear understand of the part / whole relationship , emerge even in logic and mathematics , since these provide the tool for organize our rational image of the world , in its multi-stratify complexity . thus , we be face with the problem of relate in a possibly coherent way the various form of part / whole relationship arise in different branch of science . we have not only to classify the different kind of whole and their inherent " grammar " , but also to take into account the process of formation for whole , in order to describe precisely in which sense the whole emerge out of its part and be irreducible to an aggregate of autonomous , more or less pointlike , entity . what make ( in part , at least ) the difference between mere aggregate and cohesive whole ? the member of the whole do not simply hang together : they hang together in the whole , and the structure of the whole influence the description of the part and their local interaction . in view of the grow interest in this sort of pattern , of so deep relevance for theoretical and apply science , it be therefore suitable to clarify the whole / part issue in crucial field of research , to compare different approach and to develop a foundational discussion . 2 . program june 17 9 registration 10 bill lawvere , open lecture 11 , 30 coffee break 12 john bell , w / p in algebraic and logical structure 13-15 lunch 15 ieke moerdjik , w / p in geometry , topology and topo theory 16 coffee break 16 , 30 colin mclarty , w / p in foundation of mathematics 17 , 30 carlo celluccus , w / p in logical analysis june 18 9 steve vicker , w / p in semantics for program language 10 gonzalo reye , w / p in categorical analysis of language 11 coffee break 11 , 30 john mayberry , w / p in set theory 12 , 30-15 lunch 15 nile eldredge , w / p in biology 16 coffee break 16 , 30 alberto peruzzus , w / p in epistemology and semantics 17 , 30 roberto polus , w / p in ontology june 19 9 ettore casarus , w / p in phenomenology 10 alf zimmer , w / p in gestalt psychology 11 coffee break 11 , 30 ron langacker , w / p in linguistics 12 , 30-15 lunch 15 george lakoff , w / p in cognitive science ( to be confirm ) 16 coffee break 16 , 30 chri isham , w / p in quantum topology 17 , 30 basil hiley , w / p in mechanic and cosmology 3 . updates to keep you update with more information on the conference this be the url for the w / p home page : http : / / www . gelso . unitn . it / ~ polus / 4 . registration fees registration fee only cover the participation in this conference . miscellaneous expense ( accomodation , meal and social activity ) be in addition . the registration deadline to get the early registration fare be : march 1998 , 31st . student must enclose with the registration form a photocopy of their student card . status early registration ( before 3 / 31 / 98 ) leat registration student 50 , 0 100 , 0 scholar 100 , 0 200 . 0 industrial 200 , 0 300 . 0 5 . accomodation participant should book their own accomodation . a select hotel list be the follow one : parkhotel laurin * * * * . 4 , laurinstrasse single-room and breakfast : 180 , 000-265 , 0 tel . + 39 471 31 10 0 , fax + 39 471 31 11 48 citta \ 146 * * * . 21 , waltherplatz single-room and breakfast : 110 , 0 tel . + 39 471 97 52 21 ;
