Subject: new uci dissertation in linguistic

irvine linguistic student association be please to announce the publication of the follow two uci dissertation in linguistic . feature attraction and category movement brian k . agbayanus university of californium , irvine , 1998 this dissertation present a new theory of movement in generative grammar within the framework of the minimalist program ( chomsky 1993 , 1994 , 1995 ) . the most important aspect of the new theory be that it depart from the standard view of move a as a unitary operation . the dissertation have three main goal . the first goal be to simplify the theory of feature check in such a way that a single structural configuration ( namely , the head-adjunction structure ) hold for feature check in both overt and covert syntax . the second goal be to present evidence for the split movement hypothesis , accord to which a set of formal feature and its associate category move to separate structural position in syntax . the claim be that ug make both attract and move available in the form of attract f and category movement , respectively . the former satisfy the formal requirement of feature check , and the latter yield the phonological " displacement " effect of overt movement . the theory thus abandon the treatment of move a as a unitary operation . the third goal be to explore consequence for the proper characterization of locality in syntax . the split movement approach open up a novel way to account for the traditional subjacency and condition on extraction domain effect ( huang 1982a ) that do not fall under chomsky 's ( 1995 ) attract f theory . it be argue that attract f and category movement be subject to different type of economy condition , and that the traditional subjacency and condition on extraction domain effect should not be give a unify account , contrary to the barrier approach ( chomsky 1986a ) . the theory also derive a number of previously mysterious property relate to cross linguistic variation in extractability out of island , the relative strength of island effect , and the nature of successive-cyclic movement . this dissertation present a new approach to movement in syntax which overcome the conceptual and empirical shortcoming of the traditional approach , while gain new insight into previously mysterious phenomenon and property of natural language . : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : parametrization of feature in syntax sze - wing tang university of californium , irvine , 1998 the major focus of this study be to propose a restrictive theory of parameter of universal grammar in term of the principles-and - parameter approach . i propose that semantic feature be invariant across language ; only feature that may play a role in the derivation from n to the pf interface level include phonetic feature , categorial feature , and affix feature be subject to parametric variation , which be call the ' overt parametrization hypothesis ' ( oph ) . it be argue that where affix feature be associate with a word be subject to parametric variation . movement be largely determine by morphology : movement in the overt component can be signal by ' impoverish ' morphology ; movement of morphologically ' rich ' element take place in the phonological component . under this approach , a variety of syntactic difference among chinese ( cantonese and mandarin ) , english , french , japanese , navajo , and hebrew can be account for . base on the idea of parametrization of affix feature , i claim that t have an affix feature [ - v ] in english . such an affix feature be miss in chinese . consequently , there be no v - to - t movement in chinese and v move out of vp in english . a number of apparently disparate difference between these two language , include postverbal no-phrase , the distribution of focus element , binominal each , the ' sov ' focalization construction , scopal ambiguity of quantifier , definiteness of preverbal numeral phrase , gap , and heavy np shift , receive a unify explanation . the datum present as evidence for the claim that categorial feature be subject to parametric variation be primarily base on small clause in chinese , english , and japanese . it be argue that chinese small clause be bare , english small clause be ' not-so - bare ' , and japanese allow both type of small clause . the major typological difference among these language regard the structure of small clause be derive from a parameter relate to the combination of categorial feature of noun and adjective . the finding lend support to the oph . : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : also available : > uci dissertation in linguistic griffith , teresa a . 1996 project transitivity and agreement ikawa , hajime 1996 overt movement as a reflex of morphology ishius , toru 1997 an asymmetry in the composition of phrase structure and its consequence li , xiaoguang 1997 derive distributivity in mandarin chinese takano , yujus 1996 movement and parametric variation in syntax zoerner , cyril edward 1995 coordination : the syntax of &p us $ 14 each , plus ship and handle > uci work paper in linguistic , volume 3 ( 1997 ) . edite by luther > chen - sheng liu and kazue takeda article appear in the third volume be : brian agbayanus : category raise , adjunction , and minimality lisa laus - shen cheng : " partial " wh - movement naokus fukuus : attract and the a - over - a principle toru ishius : the " cross " constraint and the minimal link condition luther chen - sheng liu : light verb and accusative - ing gerund in taiwanese yujus takano : scramble and partial object shift kazue takeda : a note on locality of category movement and feature movement sze - wing tang : the parametric approach to the resultative construction in chinese and english miyoko yashuus : identification of ellipse and other empty category us $ 14 , plus ship and handle > uci work paper in linguistic , volume 2 : proceeding of the south > western optimality theory workshop ( swot ii ) . edite by brian agbayanus > and naomus harada us $ 12 , plus ship and handle > uci work paper in linguistic , volume 1 . edite by brian agbayanus , > kazue takeda and sze - wing tang us $ 12 , plus ship and handle ship and handle ( per item ) domestic : $ 4 ;
