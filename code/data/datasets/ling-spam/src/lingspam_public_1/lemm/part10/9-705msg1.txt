( creole : collection of reusable object for language engineer . currently creole support only algortihmic object , but will be extend to datum object . ) a common model of language datum resource would be a set of inheritance hierarchy make up a forest or set of graph . at the top of the hierarchy would be very general abstraction from resource ( e . g . lexicon be about word ) ; at the leave would be datum item that be specific to individual resource . programmatic access would be available at all level , allow the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an excite element of the work could be to provide algorithm to dynamically merge common resource what we ' re suggest initially be not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to exist resource . this be not a new standard initiative , but a way to build on previous initiative . of course , the production of a common model that fully express all the subtlety of all resource would be a large undertake , but we believe that it can be do incrementally , with useful result at each stage . early version will stop decompose the object structure of resource at a fairly high level , leave the developer to handle the datum structure native to the resource at the leave of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucure . program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilk hamish cunningham wim peter remus zajac roberta catizone paolum velardus maria teresa pazienza roberto basilus brun boguraev sergeus nirenburg jame pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum
