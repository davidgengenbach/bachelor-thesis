project : the de / construction of gender role through language variation and change : international perspective marli hellinger and hadumod bussmann ( ed . ) dear linguist , actually , we have already close the list of language / author ( with some 30 language now on the project ) , but recently three language " drop out " , and we be look for someone who could contribute on chinese , romanian , or yiddish . maybe hungarian could still be add . the original call for contribution run as follow : since the establishment of feminist linguistics more than two decade ago a wealth of theoretical and empirical information have become available and we believe it be time for a collection that look across individual language boundary . we be therefore compile a volume on the structural and functional aspect of gender-relate variation and change in different language . we be primarily concern with structural property of a language ( category of gender , word-formation , pronominalization ) and speaker ' linguistic choice in talk about or as woman and man . we be also interest in learn about the tendency of variation and change ( include , where applicable , language politics ) as these reflect change in the relationship between the sex . would anyone be interest in participate ? or could someone suggest potential author to us ? detail on the project would then be make available . reply to : hellinger @ em . uni-frankfurt . de
