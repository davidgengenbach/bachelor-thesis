verlag as volume 862 of the lecture note in artificial intelligence , and the third international colloquium on grammatical inference , hold at montpellier in france , the proceedings of which be publish by springer - verlag as volume 1147 of the lecture note in artificial intelligence . follow the success of these event and the workshop on automa induction , grammatical inference , and language acquisition , hold in conjunction with the international conference on machine learn at nashville in unite state in july 1997 , the fourth international colloquium on grammatical inference will be hold from july 12 through july 14 , 1998 , at iowa state university in unite state . -

- e . g . , acquisition of grammar in conjunction with language semantics , semantic constraint on grammar , language acquisition by situate agent and robot , acquisition of language construct that describe object and event in space and time , developmental and evolutionary constraint on language acquisition , etc . * demonstrate or potential application of grammar induction in natural language acquisition , computational biology , structural pattern recognition , information retrieval , text process , adaptive intelligent agent , system model and control , and other domain . -
