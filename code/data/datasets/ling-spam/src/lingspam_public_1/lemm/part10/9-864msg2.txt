or can multimodal retrieval technique be combine to create query suitable for image , video and audio retrieval ? in general , a question be how can we create realistic query for realistic system . the third focus of this workshop be on evaluation technique for multimedium retrieval . currently , most researcher be use the standard evaluation measure define for text document ; these need to be extend / modify for multimedium document . there be also a high degree of subjectivity involve that need to be address . we will focus on the follow specific topic : - content analysis and retrieval from various media ( text , image , video , audio ) - interaction of modality ( e . g . text , image ) in index , retrieval - effective user interface ( permit query refinement etc . ) - evaluation methodology for multimedium information . we have find that researcher pay insufficient attention to it . - technique for relevance rank - multimodal query formation / decomposition - logic formalism for multimodal query - index and retrieval from scan document - e . g extract text from image , word spot - as a retrieval technique for both handwritten and print document . - testbed for evaluate multimodal retrieval : it would be nice to have some resource share here since annotate these , and come up with a good query set be difficult participation : two type of participation be expect . those interest in make a presentation at this workshop should submit their full papers either in online postscript version or in hardcopy by regular mail to the address give below . the papers should not exceed 5 , 0 word , include figure , table , and reference . those interest in participate , but not present papers , should submit a statement of interest , not to exceed 500 word . this should clearly state what aspect ( s ) of the workshop reflect their research interest . these will be use to select panelist . both type of submission be due on friday , june 5th . decision will be make no later than friday , june 26th . in the case of paper submission , the final camera-ready papers be due on july 24th . work note will be make available to all participant at the workshop . all the submission should be send to : prof . rohinus k . sriharus , cedar / suny at buffalo ub common 520 lee entrance , suite 202 amherst , ny 14228 - 2583 rohinus @ cedar . buffalo . edu organization : workshop chair ( also program chair ) rohinus k . sriharus , suny at buffalo ( rohinus @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) zhongfeus zhang , suny at buffalo ( zhongfeus @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) r . manmatha , university of massachussett ( manmatha @ c . umass . edu ) s . ravelum , university of massachussett ( ravelum @ c . umass . edu ) program committee member : shih - fu chang ( columbium u . , usa ) david harper ( robert gordon university , u . k . ) alex hauptmann ( cmu , usa ) rakesh kumar ( sarnoff , usa ) desaus narasimhalu ( isi , singapore ) candace sidner ( lotus , usa ) peter schauble ( eth , switzerland ) timetable : paper or statement of interest submission : june 5th , 1998 decision : july 19th , 1998 camera - ready paper due : july 24th , 1998 sigir conference : august 24th - 28th , 1998 workshop : august 29th , 1998 further information : further question may be direct to the address above , or go to the web page of this workshop at http : / / www . cedar . buffalo . edu / sigir98 / mmtr . html or the sigir conference main web page at http : / / www . c . mu . oz . au / sigir98 /
