cole - acl ' 98 workshop multilingual information management : current level and future ability august 16 , 1998 universitus de montrial montrial / canada the cole / acl workshop on multilingual information management be a follow-on to an nsf - sponsor workshop hold in conjunction with the first international conference on language resource and evaluation in granada , spain ( may 1998 ) , at which an international panel of invite expert consider these question in an attempt to identify the most effective future direction of computational linguistics research - - especially in the context of the need to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information . the follow-on workshop be intend to open the discussion to the computational linguistics community as a whole . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * registration deadline is july 1 ! ! ! ! * * * * to register , consult the coling / acl home page at * * * * http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / mainpage . html * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * workshop description the development of natural language application which handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information be the next major challenge face the field of computational linguistics . over the past 50 year , a variety of language-relate capability have be develop in area such as machine translation , information retrieval , and speech recognition , together with core capability such as information extraction , summarization , parse , generation , multimedium plan and integration , statistics-base method , ontology , lexicon construction and lexical representation , and grammar . the next few year will require the extension of these technology to encompass multi-lingual and multi-modal information . extend current technology will require integration of the various capability into multi-functional natural language system . however , there be today no clear vision of how these technology could or should be assemble into a coherent framework . what would be involve in connect a speech recognition system to an information retrieval engine , and then use machine translation and summarization software to process the retrieve text ? how can traditional parse and generation be enhance with statistical technique ? what would be the effect of carefully craft lexicon on traditional information retrieval ? the workshop will be organize as a series of panel report on the outcome of discussion in the granada workshop ( a report summarize the discussion at granada will be available before the cole - acl workshop ) . ample time for discussion will be include . the discussion will focus on the follow fundamental question : 1 . what be the current level of capability in each of the major area of the field deal with language and relate media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these function be integrate in the near future , and what kind of system will result ? 3 . what be the major consideration for extend these function to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrate system of the type envision in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these question in relation to the follow area : o multi-lingual resource ( lexicon , ontology , corpus , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation o automate ( cross-lingual ) summarization and information extraction o multimedium communication , in conjunction with text o evaluation and assessment technique for each of these area o method and technique ( both statistics-base and linguistics-base ) o parse , generation , information acquisition , etc . o speech recognition and synthesis o language and speaker identification and speech translation program committee khalid choukrus , european language resource association charle fillmore , university of californium berkeley , usa robert frederk , carnegie mellon university , usa ulrich heid , university of stuttgart , germany eduard hovy , information science institute , usa nancy ide , vassar college , usa mun kew leong , national university of singapore joseph marianus , limsi / cnrs , france mark maybury , the mitre corporation , usa sergeus nirenburg , new mexico state university , usa akitoshus okumura , nec , japan martha palmer , university of pennsylvanium , usa jame pustejovsky , brandei university , usa peter schaueble , eth zurich , switzerland oliviero stock , irst , italy felisa verdejo , uned , spain piek vossen , university of amsterdam , netherland wolfgang wahlster , dfki , germany antonio zampollus , istituto dus linguistica computazionale , italy organizer bob frederk center for machine translation carnegie - mellon university schenley park pittsburgh , pa 15213-3890 tel : ( + 1 412 ) 268-6656 fax : ( + 1 412 ) 268-6298 email : ref @ nl . c . cmu . edu eduard hovy information science institute of the university of southern californium 4676 admiralty way marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 tel : ( + 1 310 ) 822-1511 fax : ( + 1 310 ) 823-6714 email : hovy @ isus . edu nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , new york 12604-0520 usa tel : ( + 1 914 ) 437 5988 fax : ( + 1 914 ) 437 7498 e - mail : ide @ c . vassar . edu
