Subject: sum : reaction to synthetic speech

a number of week ago i ask very informally for people 's reaction to synthetic speech ( also prerecord speech ) and for study on emotional reaction to synthetic speech . i wish to thank those who respond : osamu fujimura margaret jackman randall a . major corey miller johanna rubba stephen p . spackman i have hop for more response , but i have start to collect information from friend and colleague as well . i ' ve realize that i need a more structure way of gather info - with the possiblitiy that this ( up until now ) rather informal approach to the matter may suddenly turn into a more formal study . the respondent react both positively and negatively to synthetic speech ; one may be irritate at the " bluntness " of the machine , the lack of flexibility in the program , etc . but still find the synthetic vocal information handy . > from per egil heggtveit at telenor , norway , i have receive a list of reference on synthetic speech , but none of the stuide cover emotional reaction . osamu fujimura write : > i suggest that you ask the question to marian macchus . i do . she respond the follow : > two of the us telephone company have > introduce a service call " reverse directory assistance " , which > be available to telephone customer . this be a telephone service whereby > a customer call a special number , enter a telephone number use > the touchtone pad , and hear the name and address of the person to > whom that telephone number be list . a speech synthesizer ( orator , > a text-to - speech synthesizer that we have develop here at bellcore ) > be use to speak the name and address . > before the introduction of this automate service , one of the > telephone company offer the service with real human operator . > today the complaint rate from customer be no higher than it be > when the service be offer with real operator . > > this be not to say that use of synthetic speech be alway acceptable . > in fact , many application for synthetic speech be not adopt > becasue the speech sound too robotic . margaret jackman write : > my experience with synthetic vocy be with our telephone information > system . it ask what be the name and address of the person for whom > we want the phone number . i be alway annoy since i know i will > usually have to repeat it to a real person later . > > i be also annoy with voice mail system that go on forever - give > me 10 different option , instead of the voice operator who put me > through to the person i want . > > i suppose the problem be n't the synthetic language - it be generally > very clear and concise . the problem be that when i get one it > generally waste my time , and for that reason , i have a negative > reaction to them . . randall a . major write : > i ' m not sure if they ' ve work on reaction or not , but you should try > contact barbara grosz at > grosz @ eec . harvard . edu > they ' ve do a lot of work on synthetic speech and she may be able to > help you . good luck ! i contact barbara grosz , who write : > sorry , but i have not do any experiment of this sort , though i have > do some work on speech synthesis . my colleague , julium hirschberg , > at at&t research may know of some research in this arena , though > i do n't believe she have do any either . i have n't contact julium hirschberg yet , but i intend to . corey miller write : > you may want to look at an article on the perception of synthetic > speech by david pisonus , in progress in speech synthesis , > van santen , sproat , olive and hirschberg , springer , 1997 . i ' ve try to get a copy of the article through our university library , but the book be too recent , and i be tell no copy be available yet . johanna rubba write : > my personal reaction to a synthetic voice on the phone be negative . i > experience > offense ( because the company involve do not care enough to have a > real person staff the phone line ; they 'd rather downsize and replace > people with machine ) ; irritation ( because i be not go to be able to > get any question answer , and be go to be oblige to follow the > inflexible program set down by the corporation [ and these be inevitably > not well-desgine , they waste the customer 's time ] . i also experience > irritation because synthetic voice do not sound like real voice , > mean i have to put forth extra effort to parse their output , and also > because i be a perfectionist and do n't understand why even relatively > simple thing like normal list intonation ( not the weird system use on > the [ non-synthetic , just pre-record ] directory assistance system ) > can't be get right . > > i know enough about computational linguistics to know that achieve > real-sound synthetic speech be extremely difficulty , esp . if context > have to be take into account . is this an excuse for ugly synthetic > speech ?
