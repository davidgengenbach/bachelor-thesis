a big thank you to the person who comment on my query ( linguist , vol . 8-808 ) on expression like ' put them away yet ? ' : j . atkinson , r . m . brend , b . clark , c . davenport , d . dee , m . donohue , m . farri , n . frishberg , d . harri , j . hilferty , l . horn , d . houghton , p . lesourd , r . mc callister , c . d . nilep , j . reighard , p . svenonius , m . swart , g . h . toop , l . trask , r . wright the result be quite definite . a ) my impression that ( 2 ) see them yet ? ( 3 ) get them yet ? ( 4 ) write him yet ? ( 5 ) hear it yet ? will have a present tense read , and that a simple past read be not possible , have be rejected almost unanimously by my informant ( only a couple of british english speaker among them ) . for most of them the simple past interpretation be in fact dominant over the present tense interpretation ; some informant even have difficulty in imagine an appropriate situation for a present tense read ; other , though , have report no problem here . b ) when expression such as ( 2 ) - ( 5 ) be use with a non-present tense mean , there be no distinction make and perceive between meaning associate with simple past in contrast to present perfect in other construction . ( this , then , support bolinger say with respect to ' put them away yet ? ' : " i do not force you to an either-or choice between the two compatible meaning ' did you put them away yet ? ' and ' have you put them away yet ? ' , in spite of formal difference , elsewhere in the structure between _ see _ , and _ see _ , _ do _ and _ do _ , _ go _ and _ go _ , etc . " . and this be what i refer to in my query as ' indeterminedness ' of mean in contrast to ' ambiguity ' . ) c ) a number of further comment have be make , e . g . concern the influence of context on the interpretation of these expression ; concern the influence of the semantic class of the verb in these expression on their interpretation ; concern the influence of the presence of _ yet _ . meanwhile i have find the follow note in quirk et al . 's _ comprehensive grammar of the english language _ : " in ame , the simple past be often prefer to the present perfective for the variant of the indefinite past discuss in this section [ 4 . 22 ] . compare [ _ have the child come home yet ? _ ] , for example , with _ did the child come home yet ? _ < esp ame > .
