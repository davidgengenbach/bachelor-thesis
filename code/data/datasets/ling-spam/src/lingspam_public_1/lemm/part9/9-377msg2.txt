- - - - - - - - - constraint - base theory of phonology have become enormously popular in recent year . such theory express generalization by state how and when a language 's phonological form be constrain , rather than relie on rule that actively modify the form . computational idea have often provide an impetus for these innovation . koskenniemus 's ( 1983 ) 2 - level morphophonological processor introduce parallel constrain relation as an alternative to an order system of rewrite rule . declarative phonology ( c 1990 ) focus on the unity of representation and rule as constraint , draw on various computational idea from unification to temporal logic to finite-state calculus . one current constraint-base theory be optimality theory ( ot ) ( prince&smolensky 1993 ) . this theory find , at least partial , inspiration in computational work by smolensky on the relation between symbolic and subsymbolic computation . although this link with connectionism have be leave largely unexplore , ot have prove to be a computationally productive theory , give rise to several theoretical papers on computational issue relate to complexity and learnability , as well as inspire a number of implementation . this workshop be design to foster the link between computational work and constraint-base phonology in general . to this end , it invite submission on topic relate to the computation of any constraint-base phonological formalism , include but not limit to the three mention above . here be some example topic : * the computational interpretation of phonological theory , * constraint rank and interaction , eg . as in ot , * implementation of particular analysis , * result in the complexity of constraint application , * algorithm for learn constraint or constraint rank , * result on the learnability of such constraint , * novel formalism for constraint-base phonology , * representational issue raise by constraint-base approach . in short , papers be invite which address computational issue in constraint-base theory of phonology . submission - - - - - - - - - what : original research , not publish elsewhere a complete study be prefer to proposal and progress report originality , topicality and clarity will be the assessment criterion how : submission must be send by email to sigphon98 @ cogscus . ed . ac . uk when : april 20 submission due may 22 notification of acceptance june 23 final ( accept ) version due submission format -
