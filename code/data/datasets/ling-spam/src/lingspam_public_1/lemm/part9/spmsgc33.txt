dear ion , i be very happy to have find you . i have no idea so many people also = share this interest in figurative language . i find this very excite = because it 's the language i work in . the operational language of = computer be binary . the operational language of the human mind be = picture . i use psychotherapy call metaphor therapy that take all = figurative statement and treat them literally . if you take an = interest in figurative speech , i think you may like to know more = about this . it 's an approach that look for the figure in figurative = speech and use them to heal or dissolve persistent uncomfortable = feeling . the figure of speech that salt out language reflect the inner figure = of the subconscious mind . so , for example , if someone say there 's a = cloud over his or her head , in the subconscious mind there be a cloud . = the cloud feel real internally because the subconscious mind accept = what it see as real ( that 's why dream appear real when the conscious = mind be turn off during sleep ) . = 20 this be important because it 's the key to the inner mind . treat the = figure ( picture ) as real open up the subconscious mind because it = accept the image as real to begin with . these figure and image = reflect our inner world and bring fascinate information to the = surface . work within the realm of a person 's own symbolic = representation of their problem or issue facilitate profound change . = using word that go to the core of our think and feeling help to = change behavior , decision and choice . = 20 there be a strong connection between figurative language and heal . = that understand have produce a new verbal technology for enter the = control center of the mind and heal the psyche . it use the figure = in language to go to the root of the psyche , where thought , feeling = and decision originate . affect change from this vantagepoint = produce greater satisfaction in personal life and professional = performance . productivity be , above all , a state of mind ; so we can never = underestimate the power of the mind in affect all realm of health = and happiness . to best gain an improve control of life , we go to the = control center where thought and feeling begin . thought and feeling = come to conscious awareness without any effort on our part and they come = directly from the conscious mind . the language of the subconscious be = neither english nor japanese , but picture and image . metaphor therapy be a unique , innovate approach that speak the same = operational language as the inner mind . the subconscious mind be not = only the very foundation of our ego , think and emotion ; it be also = where most depression , anxiety , eat and compulsive disorder , = phobia , obsessive thought , urge and unwant behavior originate . = while this be already know , what 's new be the understand that = behind each of these symptom be persistent uncomfortable feeling . what be also new be the ability to speak a therapeutic picture-language = that go to the inner mind where obstacle begin , and use these = uncomfortable feeling as a trail that lead to the root of almost any = problem . change occur at the root be alway more dynamic than = change at the surface and lead to outward change , as well . inner = heal promote outward change , more control and a stronger mind . goe directly into the control center of the mind have an add benefit = of recapture the wholeness and innate strength we be bear with . it = be natural that in the course of grow up we lose part of self as we = adjust to the demand of the world . as child , we may be subject to = abuse , neglect or trauma . our spirit may be break or bruise along the = way , but we conform and put our feeling aside . as adult , if we ' re = catch in a life threaten situation where death appear imminent , it = take even more out of us if the ego dissociate just prior to the = event . shut down as a way of avoid the event or the feeling = that go with it , the ego go somewhere else as a way of not let it = happen . when quality and characteristic of self be lose , it leave = a vague , linger feel that something be miss . recover the miss fragment of self and restore them be not = esoteric nonsense . it be a concrete discipline base on recent = advancement that permit direct access to our inner mind . speak the = language of the inner mind afford the best opportunity for heal to = occur . restoration of self dissolve a great many negative feeling , and = make the mind clearer and the will stronger . metaphor therapy = unleash the strong , innate power within by use the mind 's ability to heal itself , and create a base of = self-confidence that be genuine and last . = 20 i want to get the word out about metaphor therapy . since this may be = some real hope for some people , please share this letter with other . = as for my part , i would be happy to give you any specific information = about the approach or answer any question you may have . also , if you 'd = like some example of healing that be accomplish with the use of = figurative language , please let me know . my best , = 20 = 20 drs www . angelfire . com / ak / drsiegel
