Subject: disc : functionalism 8 . 798

this be in response to benjus wald 's comment on ( 8 . 736 , disc ) functionalism : i fear that we may be talk a little at cross-purposes here . my main interest be in clarify the position of natural phonology on the issue of so-cal contradictory process . benjus seem a little more focus on the question of what it means to call something a " cluster " in phonetic term . < delete : elaboration on the nature of phonetic cluster , particularly [ pt ] > > > the question , if i remember correctly , > > be why speaker should be able to pronounce the reduce [ pt ] > > if they could n't pronounce the unreduce one . > > in view of what i have say above , i understand that the phonological > process involve be not consciously controllable , and that reduction ( or > whatever ? ) of the first vowel in " potato " reflect a process which normally > occur when speech be not deliberate or conscious , but when it be > relatively spontaneous . so we ' re deal with unconscious stylistic > effect , in my view . i can agree with you here . this be yet another reason for believe that the fast speech reduction of [ p @ t ] to [ pt ] ( or whatever ) pose no problem at all for natural phonological theory . the fortition that break up a control attempt to pronounce initial [ pt ] would not necessarily have to apply to what be loosely describe as " [ pt ] " ( i . e . reduce [ p @ t ] ) in fast speech . > > > > the fact that you can't pronounce the cluster in no way means that the > > > > cluster be ban as a side-effect in the pronunciation of some other > > > > phonetic target . > > that just go along with what i just say , but sound absurd because it > do not explicitly acknowledge the difference between consciously > controllable phonological process , and unconscious , spontaneous , but > nevertheless learn / acquire , process . am i miss that somehow the > theory at issue do indeed account for this distinction ? doe it even > recognise it ? or , should it ? ye on all count . thank you for clarify that . natural phonology be a theory about pronounceability . that be part of baudouin 's original vision when he found modern phonological theory . it be no longer necessarily part of the modern vision of what phonology be about . basically , baudouin observe that phonetic alternation all fall into just two type - - those that involve phonetic variant of a single " phoneme " and those that involve two distinct phoneme . as stampe have point out many time , the latter be consciously manipulable . the former be quite unconscious and difficult to control . by the way , it be interest that later generation seem to have lose their way , thanks due in no small part to baudouin 's influential student shcherba . it be shcherba who seem to have influence the concept of the phoneme among british ( thence american ) linguist . shcherba limit the phoneme to be just a perceptual unit , which radically change linguistic analysis of what be includable or excludable from the study of phonology ( i . e . phonemics at the time ) . trubetzkoy retain baudouin 's essential vision of the boundary of phonology , but he prefer a more " scherbemic " conception of the phoneme . so he have to have " archiphoneme " in his phonology , which he still consider a separate branch of linguistic theory from morphophonology . sapir , who carry on a close correspondence with trubetzkoy , also retain this sharp distinction between phonology ( i . e . stampean process ) and morphophonology ( i . e . stampean rule ) . what tie all of these approach together be that pronounceability be fundamental to the concept of phonological theory ( although trubetzkoy may not have explicitly agree with this claim ) . > ( self - conscious speech be indeed the suppression of some phonetic > realisation rule , but depend on how deep your phonology - - > morphophonemic ?

that may be an interest > question for some theorist . ) there be some hide assumption in the above that make it difficult to comment on , so i ' ll just tackle the one red flag that you raise for me . a theory of phonology need not have any phonotactic , deep or otherwise . since generative theory be about well-formedness , it must address such phenomenon as part of the theory . however , natural phonology just see ban sequence of sound as those which cannot be directly ( or intentionally ) pronounce during normal speech . unpronounceability need not necessarily be attributable to a single cause . since you do n't need to pronounce nonexistent phonetic structure , you do n't need to suppress any process that affect them . hence , there can be multiple process ban so-cal phonotactically impermissible sequence . hence , no need for a single generalization in your theory to ban such sequence . < . . . > > > stampean theory predict > > that very early language learner will have both devoice of > > vowel between voiceless consonant and voice of consonant between > > vowel .

( that explain a lot , by the way . it explain sapir 's famous conundrum about the difference between blow out a candle and produce a speech sound . ) acquisition be the act of coordinate your mouth to pass just those phonetic structure that you need to get out . > natural phonology simply take the view that we put > > naturally-occure , but chaotic behavioral constraint , into some kind > > of order , depend on what challenge the target language pose for > > the articulator . what you do with contradictory process depend on > > what you have to say . > > was that the answer ? what be example of " naturally-occur , but > chaotic behavioral constraint " ? can i get away with just refer you to example in the donegan & stampe " the study of natural phonology " paper ? they do a pretty good job of talk about contradictory process in that work . by " chaotic " , i mean that the way in which process interact during l1 be not predictable . it depend on what they child attempt to pronounce . there need not be any single correct path to a properly coordinate speech tract . - rick wojcik bellevue , wa rickw @ eskimo . com http : / / www . eskimo . com / ~ rickw
