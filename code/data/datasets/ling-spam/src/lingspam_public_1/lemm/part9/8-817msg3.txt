Subject: re : 8 . 792 , disc : grammar in uk school - - a response

have be engage in the same sort of debate for several decade on this side of the atlantic , i tend to agree with professor sampson 's remark on the value of teach grammar in the uk school . but because we do not all agree on _ what _ " grammar " should be teach , and because the public , even the educate public , even school teacher and administrator , be , at least in the u . s . , ignorant of the last century 's work in linguistics , teach grammar do not turn out to be as easy as professor sampson seem to imply it be . for example , for many , probably most , linguist " correct usage " be not part of grammar . as a sociolinguist , i would prefer that correct usage be teach in secondary school - - but clearly label as something other than grammar . and even within what nearly all of us would consider " grammar , " what should be teach . most educator ( sic ) in the u . s . and most politician would seem to prefer traditional grammar , which we linguist have misname " prescriptive grammar " ( when it be actually mostly proscriptive ) . to me , teach traditional grammar have all the attraction of teach phlogiston theory to non-scientist and pass it off as serious science . many of my colleague in linguistics disagree . so the question be not " should grammar be teach in uk school ? " but rather " what sort of grammar should be teach ( everywhere , i think ) ? " carl mill university of cincinnatus
