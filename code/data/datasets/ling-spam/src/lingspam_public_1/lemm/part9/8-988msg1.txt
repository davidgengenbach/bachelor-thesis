and tone delimit the sentence . the synthetic element that still characterize many language start but as analytic element . for example , the b - past tense prefix in basque begin life as a a simple adverb , ba , mean " already " , and before that , simply " over " . the ie e-augment for non-concommitant verbal form start out as simply the adverb * e , " then " , and before that " there ( 3rd p . deixi ) " . the formant - i / y , which form adjective in so many language , be first the noun " word " , which acquire the mean " like " . many language like ie have factitive form that be simply - - at origin - - combination of the verb stem and an element mean " it " , in ie yo . the aa second person singular - k be simply a word for " male " . with this history behind us , it be difficult to believe that construction like " have do " will not , at some some future , develop into v-prefix perfect . nietzsche , of course , say it far more eloquently , but the modern phrase " what go around , come around " express it quite well also . language , like all of existence , be not unidirectional . it have a direction only in the same sense that a very small segment of a circle appears to be straight . what really separate " primitive " language from advance one , be the insistence of nominative-type ( g . a . klimov ) language on an overtly express transitive subject . the mindset that this produce be directly responsible for the scientific approach that have result in the technology of the late 20th century . however we may wish to theorize , it be a fact that the scientific advance that have us all in a state of perpetual uneasiness , have come about through scientist who speak nominative-type language , or who get their train in nominative-type language . science be simply a matter of correctly link cause and effect . nominative - type language be use to organize their thought by reflex into a cause and effect algorithm . that be not to say that speaker of other language cannot organize their thought logically . but logic and what constitute a logical approach be culturally determine . factor that nt - speaker would reject as not directly causal would be difficult to eradicate from the " logic " of thinker in other non - nt - speak cultural matrix . the single advantage that synthetic language have be freer word order , which can be economically employ for emphasize or topicalize select element of the sentence . but every analytic language with rigid word order have other device to accomplish the same purpose . pat - patrick c . ryan < proto-language @ worldnet . att . net > ( 501 ) 227-9947 ;
