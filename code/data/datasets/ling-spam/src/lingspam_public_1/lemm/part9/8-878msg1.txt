Subject: grammar in school

i 'd like to second herb stahlke 's plea , follow his brief survey of the decline in grammar teach ( which mirror the event in uk ) . > i also teach an undergrad english linguistics course that , for many > student , be the only brush with grammar in the entire english ed . > program . i find that these student , many of them well prepare and > highly motivate , have have little or no grammar in k12 . this be not > surprise , since they be teach by teacher who be teach to > believe that the teach of grammar serve no purpose . if they be > teach it at all , little effort be make to make grammar make sense or > seem relevant and interest . they will become teacher with > probablly less understand of and ability to teach grammar than even > the generation before them . > > how do we reverse this ? certainly not by either replace grammar > with even more abstract and difficulty linguistic subject matter . > we ' re not go to see change without concert effort by linguist > to work together with educator , school board and legislator to make > people aware of the nature of grammar as an academic subject . the lsa > have a stand committee on this topic , but i havent ' be able to > find out much about their activity or position from the lsa > literature or web page . we have the responsibility and the knowledge > to bring about change in grammar education , but we do n't have any sort > of unify , concert effort to do so . the same post also carry a similar message from larry rosenwald , who describe his attempt to help student to write better : > what i do care about be have a > reasonably precise vocabulary for analysis . since this strand arise out of a discussion of a recent trial in uk of some material for test pupil ' knowledge of grammar , reader may be interest in the background . recent development in uk be interest and ( to my mind ) potentially very positive , in spite of have be introduce for quite the wrong reason ( by a right-we government aim at a return to ` basics ' ) . the official national curriculum require * all * school to teach grammar . the most obvious statement of this requirement be under the head ` write ' for secondary school ( specifically , lead up to age 14 and 16 ) : ` pupil should be encourage broaden their understand of the principle of sentence grammar and be teach to organise whole text effectively . [ note the stress on understand grammar as well as on apply this understand . ] pupil should be give opportunity to analyse their own write , reflect on the mean and clarity of individual sentence , use appropriate terminology , and so be give opportunity to learn about : - discourse structure - the structure of whole text - paragraph structure ; how different type of praragraph be form ; opening and closing in different kind of write ; - phrase , clause and sentence structure - the use of complex grammatical structure and the link of structure through appropriate connective ; the use of main and subordinate clause and phrase ; - word - component include stem , prefix , suffix , inflection ; grammatical function of noun , verb , adjective , adverb , pronoun , preposition , conjunction and demonstrative ; - punctuation - the use of the full range of punctuation mark , include full stop , question and exclamation mark , comma , semi-colon , colon , . . ' as a linguist i have very few argument with this list ( give its purpose etc ) . it 's also recognise that teacher themselve need to be train to do this kind of work . but it 's rather ambitious , and the teacher ( and teacher-trainer ) need help from the professional - i . e . us . i think a lot of us in the uk would be interest to hear from colleague in other country where school grammar be feed more directly by academic grammar . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = richard ( = dick ) hudson department of phonetic and linguistic , university college london , gower street , london wc1e 6bt work phone : + 171 419 3152 ; work fax : + 171 383 4108 email : dick @ ling . ucl . ac . uk web-site : home page = http : / / www . phon . ucl . ac . uk / home / dick / home . htm unpublish papers available by ftp = . . . . uk / home / dick / papers . htm
