Subject: re : 8 . 836 , galore ?

i just read , belatedly , alan harri 's communication re punctuation . what strike me be not the inappropriate " ' " , but the word ' galore ' . what the heck be that ? is it an obligatorily post-pose adjective ? is it unique in english ? it can't be a matter of idiomatic phrase , since it seem to me it can be add to noun plural or mass noun : come out to our ranch , we ' ve get horse galore , cattle galore , sheep galore , etc . jule levin
