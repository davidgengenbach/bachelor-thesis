john phillip ( 8 . 859 ) ask , with respect to apostrophise plural , e . g . " dyslexic 's " , " sonata 's " , < < exactly what be the grounds for condemn this usage ? > > one of the joy of linguistlist be that only here could such a question be ask , and from an academic address . it be , i think , benjus wald who perceptively remark , in the ebonic debate , that linguist , and only linguist , believe in the equal value of all language form . perhap i may widen the question to " what be the grounds for condemn particular variation in human symbolic behaviour ( vocabulary , accent , spell , non - si unit , facial hair , clothe , tie or untie lace ) ? " ala , the answer be not universalistic , and come down to one of two tyrannical reason : because it ' ll harm your job prospects ; and , even more tyrannical : because your peer will make fun of you . it depend on who you take as your reference group ( " whom " for american reader ) , and how much you feel like a fight . a lot of academic linguist be in fact not neutral on this issue - - they want a sort of compensatory justice for the usage of disadvantage group , " threaten language " like their biologist colleague ' " threaten species " . ( there be , of course , self-serve as well as moral reason for this . ) and this may go some way to explain the gulf of incomprehension between them and other people . it be hard to find common grind between those who believe in " better oneself " and those who think this invidious rubbish . roger depledge freelance translator toulouse
