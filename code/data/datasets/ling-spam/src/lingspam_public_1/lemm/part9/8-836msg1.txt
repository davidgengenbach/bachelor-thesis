in the san fernando valley , on chatsworth blvd at balboa , be a sign with " salad 's galore . " i have often muse about what a ' galore ' may be and why 's alad ' own it ! the error of insert the apostrophe for a plural ( nonpossessive ) be seemingly endemic amongst college student in southern californium , too . even though i give them fact sheet warn against such a usage , i get the error quite regularly on term papers - - especially with " longer " or less frequently use plural , i . e . , " boy " or " name " come out all right but " linguist 's " ( pl . ) or " dyslexic 's " do not fare so well . i would submit that it be not only endemic but epidemic ! however , it be a part and parcel of orthographic change in this part of the twentieth century and probably rate right up there with " alright , " alot , " and " nitelite . " cheer , ach = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = alan c . harri , ph . d . telnos : main off : 818-677 - 2853 professor , communication / linguistic direct off : 818-677 - 2874 speech communication department californium state university , northridge home : 818-366 - 3165 spch csun fax : 818-677 - 2663 northridge , ca 91330-8257 internet email : alan . harris @ csun . edu www homepage : http : / / www . csun . edu / ~ vcspc005 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
