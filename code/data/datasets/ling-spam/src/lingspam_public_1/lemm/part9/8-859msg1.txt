there have be several posting recently decry the use of apostrophe- to make an english plural form , e . g . " dyslexic 's " , " sonata 's " . on what grounds be this hold to be bid english ? like everyone else , i learn at school that the apostrophe be not to be use in english plural except for a few exceptional case like numeral and letter ( " the 1990 's " , " three a 's " ) . this last usage seem to have go out of fashion recently , but apostroph be in practice widely use in all sort of plural form , and they seem to have a long history of use at least in foreign or unusual word - i ' ve notice apostrophise plural in facsimile of several seventeenth century book recently . exactly what be the grounds for condemn this usage ? john phillip
