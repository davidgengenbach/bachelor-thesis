Subject: re : 8 . 826 , disc : evolution analytic > synthetic

just to add a little more to the value judgment part of martin haspelmath 's very clear explication of current view of the evolution of typology , i should point out that otto jespersen believe that the evolution from synthetic to analytic ( such as have happen between old and modern english ) be an overall improvement , with an assumption that totally isolate language like chinese represent the ideal goal of language . i do n't have my copy easily available , but i believe this view can be find in the philosophy of grammar . i have hear it suggest that the reason j believe this be he believe english be close to an ideal language . i second martin 's claim that the view that there be a fairly clear consensus among historical linguist about the directionality he discuss . current introductory text certainly include discussion of this view - - a nice discussion can be find , for example in terry crowley 's _ an introduction to historical linguistic _ ( oxford , 1992 ) , and similar discussion can be find in other current text . geoff geoffrey s . nathan department of linguistic southern illinoi university at carbondale , carbondale , il , 62901 usa phone : + 618 453-3421 ( office ) fax + 618 453-6527 + 618 549-0106 ( home )
