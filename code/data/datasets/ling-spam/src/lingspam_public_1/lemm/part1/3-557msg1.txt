Subject: case - mark in the genitive

i ' m interest in language with case-agreement in the genitive , i . e . language where any case which the head may take must be copy on the dependent . these be pretty common in australium , e . g . uradhus ( g / be gamma ) : wutpu - : namu-mun g / antu-mun old-man - gen-abl canoe - abl " from the old man 's canoe " they ' re also find in the caucasus , in the language of the ethiopian highland , and in some siberian language . all these only have suffixal genitival agreement . i have three question : 1 . doe anyone know of any language outside these area which have similar genitival agreement ? 2 . doe anyone know of any language which have prefix genitival agreement ? 3 . doe anyone know of any language where all case-mark for the entire genitival phrase appear affix solely on the dependent ? ( i have two example already : kanurus and sumerian ) my thank !
