Subject: ancient vocal tract simulation

in work follow up the work of laitman , lieberman et al on reconstruction of what vocal tract of hominid and early human must have be like , i believe some mechanical simulator of the output of these be make . i would be interest in detail of this , but more in whether anyone have try to do a computer simulation of the phonetic range of vocal tract that differ from those of modern human e . g . in have a higher larynx . on a relate question , i see a letter to scientific american a year or so ago say some of the origin of language work be base on a fallacy : that mammal other than human can breathe and swallow at the same time . > from my read this do seem to underly some of the major work , so i 'd like to have some confirmation that it be wrong or someone to point me to where the debate be go on , if there be a debate . from my point of view ( ignorance of anatomy / physiology and biological anthropology ) it would seem to be a question that could be fairly easily resolve empirically . patrick mcconvell , anthropology , northrn territory university , po box 40146 , nt 0811 , australium
