( gary marcus and his colleague at mit have a monograph on this that be not yet out . ) children do tend to produce what they here , at least statistically . 2 ) the assumption be make , in the absence of any data , that child rarely hear adult produce sentence like ( 1a ) above . this be an amaze claim , and i doubt that it be true . 3 ) even if it be true , wyngaerd be make generalization about learn in the absence of a theory of learning . these last two thing be unfortunately very common . why do we think that it 's ok to say , " there 's no datum on this , but if there be , i ' m sure it would be x " , and expect people to take it seriously ? or " i have no theory of learn , but i ' m sure that it would n't predict x " ? i ' m a phonologist , and i have n't keep up with change in syntactic theory , and i ' m sure that i would n't be allow to get away with statement like " i have no reasonable formal theory of syntax , but if i do , i ' m sure that it could n't accommodate subj-aux inversion , so all theory of formal syntax must be wrong " . but this statement be no different in kind from the other one . one last statement implicit in much work in linguistics : " i have no theory of genetics , ontogeny , or evolutionary biology , but i ' m sure that if i do , modern linguistic assumption about innateness would fit in real well . " maybe we should ask a bite more of ourselve that we often do . - - - joe stemberger
