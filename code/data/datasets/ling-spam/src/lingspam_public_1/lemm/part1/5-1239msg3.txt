" that motivate me to prepare the append item . please feel free to pass it around . tony woodbury * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * count eskimo word for snow : a citizen 's guide lexeme refer to snow and snow-relate notion in steven a . jacobson 's ( 1984 ) yup ' ik eskimo dictionary [ 1 ] anthony c . woodbury university of texa at austin july 1991 this be a list of lexeme refer to snow and relate notion in one eskimo language , central alaskan yupik ( or just yup ' ik eskimo ) . it be speak by about 13 , 0 people in the coast and river area of southwestern alaska from norton sound to bristol bay . it be one of five eskimo language . ( of these five , probably the best-known be inuit , speak in a series of well-differentiate dialect rang from northern alaska , all across the canadian far north , and up to the coast of greenland . while the term inuit be prefer to eskimo by many in canada , the term be retain here because ( a ) it properly refer to any eskimo group , not only the inuit ; and ( b ) its use be widespread in native community in alaska . ) this be a list of lexeme rather than of word . roughly , a lexeme can be think of as an independent vocabulary item or dictionary entry . it 's different from a word since a lexeme can give rise to more than one distinctly inflect word . thus english have a single lexeme _ speak _ which give rise to inflect form like _ speak _ , _ speak _ , and _ speak _ . it 's especially important to count lexeme rather than word when talk about eskimo language . that 's because they be inflectionally so complicate that each single noun lexeme may have about 280 distinct inflect form , while each verb lexeme may have over 1000 ! obviously , that would put the number of snow word through the roof very quickly . the list be organize accord to lexeme * meaning * . perhap somewhat arbitrarily i have count fifteen of them , place within each of them noun and / or verb lexeme have the same basic sense . and perhap even more arbitrarily , i ' ve group these fifteen meaning into four larger set . but the most arbitrary decision of all be leave to the discretion of the reader-the decision of how to count the lexeme themselve . here be some of the problem you face : ( a ) are all fifteen lexeme meaning really 's now ' - meaning ? that be , do word with these meaning really count for you as word for snow ? [ 2 ] ( b ) there be some synonym present - - alternative lexeme with the same mean , like garbage v . trash in english . are you go to count them separately , or together ? ( c ) if you decide to count synonym together , will you also count together both of the member of noun-verb pair have basically the same mean ? ( the member be , technically speak , separate lexeme since partly idiosyncratic morphological change mark the verbal form , and must therefore be list separately in any truly informative dictionary , as indeed jacobson 's dictionary do . ) ( d ) follow jacobson , i ' ve specially label those lexeme that only occur in a small subpart of the central alaskan yupik - speak region . are you go to try to make count for each separate dialect ? if yes , you will wonder if you really have enough information to do so . ( you ' re not alone in this-such information be difficult to compile , whether or not you be a linguist , and also whether or not you be a native speaker of a language . ) [ 3 ] a . snow particle ( 1 ) snowflake qanuk 's nowflake ' qanir - ' to snow ' qanunge - ' to snow ' [ nun ] qanugglir - ' to snow ' [ nun ] ( 2 ) frost kaneq ' frost ' kaner - ' be frosty / frost sth .
