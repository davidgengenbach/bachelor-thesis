Subject: re : 3 . 427 innateness

time for me to leap to the other side of the fence for a change . innateness do have a significance for linguistic theory itselt , if only in that the limitation of our inate ability , mathematical , linguistic or what have you , limit the type of linguistic theory which can be plausibly construct . process of grammatical structure in real time be one example . of course , we know almost nothing about the capacity of human being in this regard , which be slightly more or less than we know about universal of language , if any . < grin > . still , to the extent we have or can acquire information about our inate capacity for language ( assume it to exist ) , it can help direct our energy in the proper direction . of course before we start talk about the limit of this capacity , we ought to have a clear picture of what sort of linguistic phenomenon be involve in speak language , but that be the dread descriptivism again . . . eric schiller , department of linguistic , univ . of chicago
