the folks concern with speak a lot of language would include those direct the mormon missionary effort and those who run the school for diplomat ( etc . ) assign to a variety of foreign posting . such people be very clever at develop language skill in their student but in part because they be remorselessly practical ( i . e . anti-theoretical ) . it strike me that the popularity of language instruction by the intuitive method may explain in part why knowledge of grammar ( any sort of rudimentary grammar ) be no longer very common in the general population . lot of people get a dose of english grammar in middle school , but i wonder if that sort of thing will stick when it simply seem to tell you ( or even to misrepresent ) what you know already . if only seventh-grade grammar teacher could convince their student that it be interest to see how systematically you behave without know it ! but this be the age at which one 's child may raise their voice in protest if you seem to be lecture them about an area in which they lay claim to adult competence . . . . - - rick
