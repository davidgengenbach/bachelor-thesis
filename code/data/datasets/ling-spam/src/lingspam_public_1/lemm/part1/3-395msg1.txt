Subject: re : 3 . 387 rule , tone grammar

in response to eric schiller 's comment on modern syntax , i have a few question and comentary . as a graduate student myself i find that modern syntax have stray so far into the theoretical realm of the ivory tower , that i be hesitant to delve into it . every two or three day there be another " universal " proposal that be propose by someone only to be find untrue by someone else . i do n't think the only end goal of grammatical theory be to explain why language function as it do , for me , explanatory adequacy can be the formulation of rule that facilitate the teach of language , albeit imperfect rule in a strictly scientific sense ( be we still worry how " scientific we appear ? ) but rule that have some practical application . the notion of economy be a good one , as a student i would certainly appreciate less " model " and more substance ! p . s . i hope i have ' nt stick my foot in my mouth , it 's just that i be about to start my doctorate and be face with the question of my specialization , i like syntax but want to do something more " hand on " like sociallinguistic . . . . brett rosenberg dept . spanish and portuguese univ . of arizona
