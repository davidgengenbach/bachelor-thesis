Subject: re : 3 . 402 query : language - speaker , syntax , text

about " who speak language " : on the one hand i ' m just as frustrate as most linguist with the question " how many language do you speak " , but on the other hand i think it 's vastly incorrect to say " linguist be concern only with formalize grammar and symbol system " . the fact that some of us * be n't * concern primarily with these issue be why the recent discussion on rule be for us so baffle . there be still some of us who be concern with very good description of language and language . not that write grammar or dictionary will get us grad student job . . . but there be a good number of us who be both fluent in contemporary theory and comfortable with large amount of detail language datum . sometime we speak one or more of the language we ' re study ; often we learn * about * the language such that we end up with a very different kind of work knowledge than the native speaker have . many of us for whom careful data-gather and analysis be a high priority can readily translate bit of the language we work on , but would n't be much good in a conversation . i really feel that the two task be different - - i would n't make a very good simultaneous interpreter , and someone who would probably can't tell you the structural thing that i can about the language in question . perhap this be obvious to the more experience linguist out there . . . but it 's be rattle around in my head after a couple of conference where i meet ( 1 ) great theoretician who control very little datum ( 2 ) great descrip - tivist who care very little about recent theoretical development and ( 3 ) a healthy number of people , especially grad student , who care about both . it seem those in the latter category be try to be both collector of raw datum and statistician , in the analogy that 's be offer . any thought on this ? kathleen hubbard u . c . berkeley
