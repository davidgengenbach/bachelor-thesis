Subject: run-on word ?

could anyone tell me why we have compound , run-on word in english orthography , like 's omethe ' , 's omeone ' , ' therefore ' , ' wherea ' , ' everyone ' and so on ? be there any real linguistic phenomenon be capture here by omit the usual word boundary in the spell ? i find myself do it with word like ' realtime ' and ' harddisk ' and i do n't know why . the reason i ask be that i have be work on a program which do syllable count . these run-on word with the silent-e in the middle of the word cause the program to differ from human performance . it be easy to discount english syllable count for a final ' e ' on a word with at least one other vowel cluster , but the silent-e in the middle of a word can only be do with a lookup table - - and that be a real drag for otherwise elegant program . how would i know if i get all the run-on list or not ? do it get apply every time there be an ' e ' in the middle of a word ? stan . stankulus @ uwf . bitnet = = = : : close your eye , my darl , or three of them at least - - - - - old venusian lullaby
