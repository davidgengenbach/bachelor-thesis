Subject: chomsky citation

forgive me if i miss this , but in the earlier discussion of chomsky 's elevate position in the citation index , do anyone work out how many of the citation be for his linguistic work and how many be for his political work . i ask this out of general interest , and also because a colleague of mine be interest to know the extent of his stature in academic political study . comment on the latter could be direct directly to me .
