Subject: re : 3 . 402 query : language - speaker , syntax , text

i would like to address the issue of " who speak language ? " it seem to me that this be a big problem . while linguist study structure of various kind , language teacher study literature , and , if they ' re lucky , pedagogy ( very few graduate school offer any theoretical orientation to teach to literature student , which be where most college language teacher come from ) . thus many college language teacher must teach without background ( and with resentment , for some ) while they research in a different area entirely . when some linguist teach language , they teach structure , not speak . thus , when take an unusually-taught language under the auspices of a linguistics department , all we do be talk about structure , we never learn to speak it . talk about language be throw out many year ago as a way to learn to speak ! neither group , unhappy literature teacher nor structure-happy linguist , be likely to improve the image of language learn in this country . leslie morgan morgan @ loyvax
