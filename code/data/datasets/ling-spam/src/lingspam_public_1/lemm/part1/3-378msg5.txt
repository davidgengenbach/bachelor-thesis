hi , help ! i have to design an experiment to do with mandarin tone as part of a phonology requirement on my graduate course . there seem to be very little literature on this in the library . if anyone can think of any on-go debate on the phonology / phonetics of mandarin tone for which an experiment would be useful , please could you give me information and reference . i would welcome any suggestion at all . thank a lot , sophium wang .
