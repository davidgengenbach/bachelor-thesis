Subject: re : 5 . 1205 linguistic and imperialism

for what it be worth , i remember hear somewhere that the old persian empire use to employ a number of translator who be competent both in the imperial language and in the language of their region to carry message throughout the empire . presumably , this be somewhat similar to the british empire where imperial functionary use to receive additional payment when they have pass appropriate exam in local language . an old family friend who be district commissioner for some part of uganda use to sit in court regularly oversee case in customary law which be always conduct in the vernacular . these be not language that be necessarily well-known in the fco , although he have to make regular report back to london . although he would not have describe himself as a linguist , it would seem that his work depend on an amount of ( pre-theoretical ) linguistics . tony bex
