Subject: q : fundamental frequency software

dear colleague , i would be grateful if you could provide me any information about software that analysis human speech and show the fundamental frequency of it . in particular , i be look for software that would analyse record speech ( record in real condition and not in laboratory one ) and show the fundamental frequency of an utterance , with the ability to describe the exact pitch of each vowel - or voice consonant - , as well as its loudness . i believe that a parallel representation of the waveform would help a lot , in order in order for me to determine the exact pitch of a vowel and its relative loudness . i be work with soundwave software , but i will not have access to that software any more . moreover , since i have see much more sophisticate representation of f0 in last recent journal and periodical , i be look for something faster and more detail than soundwave . i would like to know the type of software that exist either for ibm compatible pcs , or for mac , or even for unix . please tell me also the kind of hardware that be necessary for each software , and where i could find or buy this gear . i would really appreciate any information that you would send me , and i promise to summarise it and distribute it through the linguist list . thank you in advance dimitri papazachariou . department of language and linguistic university of essex wivenhoe park colchester co4-3sq england e-mail address : papaz @ essex . ac . uk
