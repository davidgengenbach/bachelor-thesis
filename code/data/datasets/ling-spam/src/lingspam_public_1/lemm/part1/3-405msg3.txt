Subject: re : 3 . 402 query : language - speaker , syntax , text

in answer to michael sikillian 's query : i like the analogy between linguist / language and statistician / datum . from a somewhat different , though relate , point of view , here be another that i think be apt . many people must do calculation of various kind now and again ( even give the mechanical aid we now have ) . there be a tendency among the laity to re - gard mathematician as little more than skill calculator ; but mathema - tician be not mere calculator - - rather thay be ( to a degree ) investus - gator of the underlie principle of , e . g . , the number system ( and hence of the method of calculation ) . one particular respect in which i think the analogy be a good one be this . many mathematician , though not all , be highly adept at calculation . and many linguist , though not all , be ( a ) polyglot , and ( b ) more than routine - ly adept language learner . and the converse hold as well : there be goiod calculator who be n't much good at math and there be good language learner who can't fathom linguistics ( i know whereof i speak , believe me ! ) i suspect , though i be not sure , that you could take this even further . my experience suggest that most linguist get interest in the field as the result of a second language learn experience - - or at least that such an experience have an important influence on them . and i suspect that it 's also true that many mathematician develop their interest in the begin from think about what they be do when they do addition , subtraction etc . since this be advance as an empirical claim ( carefully hedge ) , datum bear on it be / be most welcome . michael kac
