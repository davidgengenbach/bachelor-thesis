Subject: query about english interrogative

i would appreciate any reference that discuss the relationship or correspondence between the syntactic form and the pragmatic ( or social ) function of interrogative in english . much of the work that i be familiar with claim that any form can be use for any function . my own research suggest otherwise . please send reply directly to : freed @ apollo . montclair . edu ( alouse f . freed linguistic montclair state college )
