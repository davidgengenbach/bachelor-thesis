Subject: become a linguist

i support gilbert 's thesis . to be sure , one stimulus be grow up on a university campus where there be lot of foreign-born faculty , so one hear and see a lot of different language in people 's house , bookcase , and refrigerator ( like the pickle jar i once see label in polish ) . but another be certainly the movie the day the earth stood still , where michael rennie , play klaatu , have to communicate with the robot gort in his home language and , indeed , where patricium neal , play mr . benson , have to memorize a sentence in that language and repeat it to gort to save the world toward the film 's end . a third stimulus be major in a science in college ( chemistry ) which have a strong focus on concept of " structure " . finally , one have to actually discover linguistics , which be n't the kind of thing one hear about in college before the 60 . it be nice one could do something with language ( s ) without have to be exclusively historically orient and without have to worry about , say , the kind of apple hurl into the thorax of gregor samsa ( now class , on the basis of textual evidence , be it a golden delicious or not ? or do the apple represent the disapproval of franz the k 's dad ? ? ? ? ? )
