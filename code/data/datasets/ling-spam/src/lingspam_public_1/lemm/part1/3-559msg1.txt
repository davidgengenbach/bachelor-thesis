Subject: physic : culture dependent or independent ?

i ' m currently into a bite of a sling match with a physicist who reckon physics be culture independent . physicist do not , accord to his view , create their concept , but discover them by observation of the fact . he seem to be convince that if physics have be persue by the navaho or by some highland papuan first ( his and my example in private discussion ) it would be exactly the same kind of physics than the one develop in the west that we know now . has anyone some view on this ? i ' m try to tell him he be wrong . or be i ? to help me prove my case ( if there be a case to be prove ) , could anyone come up with language where there be no concept for the ( physical ) concept of " force " ? my discussant 's view be that if in a language there be no such concept it will be create , because the physical force of western physics be just there , in the world , for us to be observe . my view be that without such a concept , there be no guarantee that you must develop a kind of physics which be " western " in outlook . i need help ! ! thank . please send general comment ( first question ) to the list , and example of language to me . i ' ll summarize . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - dr bert peeter tel : + 61 2 202344 department of modern language 2 202344 university of tasmanium at hobart fax : 2 207813 gpo box 252c bert . peeter @ modlang . uta . edu . au hobart tas 7001 australium
