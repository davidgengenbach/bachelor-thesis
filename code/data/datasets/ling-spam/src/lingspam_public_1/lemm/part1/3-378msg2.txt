a graduate student in education approach a colleague of mine with a query which linguist people may be able to help with . he be do an evaluation of an exchange program with indonesium one object of which be to prepare more high school teacher of indonesium here in australium . he wonder if there be anything write on the correlation of degree of acquisition of an l2 with degree of empathy and participation in the culture of the l2 speaker . high involvement / skill may seem to be a good thing for teacher in both area ; however negative aspect may be there . apparently there seem to be a correlation between development of good skill in the language and drop out of teach . could this be due to " culture shock " on return to australium of those who become most deeply immerse ? any reference / idea gratefully receive . if there be a number , i could summarise . patrick mcconvell , anthropology , northrn territory university , po box 40146 , casuarina , nt 0811 , australium
