Subject: query on spanish and bind

this be a request for help , in the form of reference , suggestion , etc . , on a syntactic problem ( or maybe only an apparent problem ) . i have recently stumble upon some interest spanish datum which seem to violate bind principle . in particular , my informant have provide example like juan hablo a pedro de / sobre el and insist that el can can have as its antecedent at least juan , and perhap also pedro . if the fact be what they seem , bind principle 2 be clearly violate , since we have a pronoun which be not free in the local domain . there be also case , although not so clear , in which an anaphor seem not to be bind in the local domain . any thought on such example will be greatly appreciate . if there be interest , i will post a summary of response receive . thank . steve seegmiller seegmiller @ apollo . montclair . edu
