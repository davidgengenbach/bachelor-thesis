Subject: 3 . 429 how do we end up linguist ?

i ' ll put myself in the foot-in - the-humanity & foot-in - the-science camp . i remember , from my senior year of high school , do the dish with my father ( a sci-fus fan and long-time reader of ' scientific american ' ) and have a discussion about what i would study in college . i tell him i like english but mostly grammar , not lit-crit , and i test well in math . he say , " sound like linguistics to me . " and , right he be ! and the half&half story still hold : now here i be , remake myself ( again ) in private industry , from a humanity specialist ( that 's how i get hire into ibm ) to a multimedium researcher in a computer science group and now to a usability engineer . when i pinch myself , it 's still me . nancy frishberg ( nancyf @ watson . ibm . com )
