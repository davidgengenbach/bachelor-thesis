Subject: sum : dets and number

about a month ago , i post the follow query : i ' m look for language whose nps have the follow three property : ( 1 ) bare , unmark noun occur in argument position , and may be interpret as either singular or plural ( eg . malay , mandarin , japanese , as oppose to english ) ; ( 2 ) at least some determiner be unmark for number ( eg . english " the " , " some " , " john 's " , as oppose to " this " , " these " ) ; and , most interestingly , ( 3 ) when a bare , unmark noun occur in construction with a determiner that be unmark for number , the result np * be * mark for number . so far , i be familiar with two language satisfy the above three condition . ( both be singaporean dialect of language whose standard variety do n't satisfy these condition . ) singaporean malay ( 1 ) like in standard malay , bare , unmark noun be unmark for number , eg . " kuce " ( cat / cat ) ; ( 2 ) again like in standard malay , the determiner " itu " ( that / the ) and inus " ( this ) be unmark for number , eg . " seekor kuce itu " ( that / the one cat ) , " dua ekor kuce itu " ( those / the two cat ) ; ( 3 ) unlike in standard malay , bare , unmark noun in construction with " itu " and inus " tend to be interpret as singular , eg . " kuce itu " ( that / the cat / ? * cat ) . [ apparently , there be some variation here between speaker , and between different construction for the same speaker . ] singlish ( aka colloquial singaporean english ) ( 1 ) unlike in standard english , bare , unmark noun be unmark for number , eg . " cat " ( cat / cat ) ; ( 2 ) like in standard english , prenominal possessor such as " john 's " be unmark for number , eg . " john 's one cat " ( john 's one cat ) , " john 's two cat ( s ) " ( john 's two cat ) ; ( 3 ) when bare , unmark noun be precede by prenominal possessor , the result construction can only be interpret as singular , eg . " john 's cat " ( john 's cat / * cat ) . some questions : ( a ) is anybody familiar with more such example ? ( reference ? ) ( b ) is this a southeast asian areal feature and / or a common cross-linguistic pattern ? ( c ) in both of the above case , an unmark noun plus an unmark determiner result in a singular np . are there any case where the result be a plural np ? ( d ) doe anybody have any idea how to analyze / explain this phenomenon ( within any theoretical framework , or none ) ? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * this be one case where the summary be much shorter than the query itself . two other language emerge with a pattern identical to that of singaporean malay : japanese ( thanks to pamelum a down and mayumus masuko ) , and korean ( thanks to jae jung song ) . ( in the meantime , further field work of my own reveal that in singlish , not just prenominal possessor but also the definite article " the " exhibit a similar singularity effect : although unmark for number ( as evidence by " the one cat " , " the two cat ( s ) " ) , " the cat " be interpret as singular . ) further observation be provide by steven berbeco , richard dearmond , bob fradkin , mark a . mandel , edith a . moravcsik , and gwyn william .
