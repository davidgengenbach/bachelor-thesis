Subject: re : 3 . 396 chomsky citation

i would like to second mark durie 's concern with what he call a " pre-generative black hole in modern citation pattern " . it seem a real problem to me that so many of the younger scholar train in the chomskian school of linguistics be almost completely ignorant of any work do outside that school . on the other hand it seem those who do have a solid knowledge of the history of idea in linguistics and have an awareness of typological diversity and have work seriously with a number of language tend to produce superior work . a prime example be the work of michael silverstein , whose work be ground on a very thorough knowledge of the work of sapir , boa , saussure , bloomfield , etc . , as well as experience do detail work with american indian and australian language , as well as a good knowledge of work do in the philosophy of language .
