Subject: a question about the ssc

i ' m stump by the presence of a dash in the definition of the ssc , and i have n't meet a linguist who can tell me what it means . i ' m sure there 's someone out there who can answer this question - - when chomsky give the specify subject condition ( p . 90 , essay on form and interpretation ) it look like this : no rule can involve x , y in the structure . . . x . . . [ . . . z . . . - wyv . . . ] . . . alpha where z be the specify subject of wyv in alpha . what be that dash for ? it 's not mention . newmeyer , in his book on the history of modern linguistics , copy the constraint exactly , but also do n't mention the dash . if it 's simply there to seperate the constituent , why be n't there a dash between the w , y and v ? thank , janet hitzeman hitzeman @ c . rochester . edu
