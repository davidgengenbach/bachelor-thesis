Subject: summary : ' typewriter ' and " canadian " raise

i recently ask , as i do periodically , if anyone know of speaker who have different vowel in _ rider _ and _ writer _ ( i . e . , who have canadian raise , so call , for the diphthong / aus / ) but who use the vowel of _ rider _ in the second syllable of _ typewriter _ . i receive a fair amount of mostly irate comment from people who think this be impossible . however , i have find one speaker ( who happen to be a linguist but not a phonologist ) who have this pronunciation . as it happen he be not from ontario , but from illinoi , but i believe that his existence strengthen the case for the hitherto purely hypothetical account i have propose of how joo come to " invent " the non-existent ontario dialect in which supposedly _ writer _ and _ rider _ be homophonous . a careful read of joo show that the only example he actually cite be _ typewriter _ , not _ writer _ ! i thus believe that there must have be more speaker who say _ writer _ with a higher vowel , but both _ rider _ and _ typewriter _ with a lower one than my sole informant , and that this sporadic pronunciation be what lead to the birth of the whole myth about rule order in canadian english , which persist till now as the example of crucial rule order in the phonological literature . it may not be as glamorous as the eskimo snow word myth , but there it be .
