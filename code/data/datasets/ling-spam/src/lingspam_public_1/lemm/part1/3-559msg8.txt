Subject: double negation in black english

i be wonder if anyone have do research on double negation in black english in recent year . i be interest in particular in an old claim of labov 's that double negation in be spread across clause boundary as in : ain't no cat can't get in no coop as it happen , i believe that labov be wrong and that this example illustrate a different phenomenon , namely , reinterpretation of such structure as consist of a single clause ( with ' ain't ' become a negative marker . and i be look for any relevant research .
