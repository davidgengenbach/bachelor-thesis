Subject: re : 5 . 1251 sum : " typewriter " and canadian raise

raise of / aus / before voiceless stop be not that uncommon in various part of the eastern us and canada . simply because someone can't hear the difference do n't mean it be n't there , as in don / dawn . seed j . k . chamber 's " canadian raise " in canadian journal of linguistic 18 ( 1973 ) or better yet timothy vance 's " canadian raise in some dialect of the northern us " in american speech 62 ( 1987 ) . i do this and can tell generally when someone else be . word boundary come into play . for me , " ice scream " and " i scream " be quite different at normal speed . and " quite " without raise sound like " quiet " though different . this be more of an issue for the dialect group . ( note that i do not say eh ? )
