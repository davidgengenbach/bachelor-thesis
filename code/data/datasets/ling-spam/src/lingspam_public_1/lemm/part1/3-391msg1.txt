Subject: re : 3 . 386 chomsky , mac concordance

it seem to me that for whatever reason , the fact that there be so many reference to chomsky by non-linguist ( let 's ignore the linguist for now ) show that the field be at least recognize as a legitimate area of intellectual inquiry - - ( after all , even oxford decide a few year ago that they should have a professor of linguistic - - after a long debate to be sure ) this be a cause for exhaltation - - not snyde remark or comparison to stalin and mao . and linguist of whatever stripe or theoretical persuasion should recognize that our newly recognize status be due to a great extent to the advent of generative grammar and chomsky . for various reason i have meet a number of nobel laureate over the last ten to fifteen year , and each one on learn i be a linguist ask " do you know noam chomsky ? " and each remark at some point that he think chomsky be one of the great intellect in history . a much better response than be ask " how many language do you speak ? " while that may still be the layperson 's view of our field , it be no longer the view among scientist and academician across the board . vickus fromkin
