in the context of " who speak language ? " let me comment on how one become a linguist . michael kac write : > i suspect , though i be not sure , that you could take this even further . my > experience suggest that most linguist get interest in the field as the > result of a second language learn experience - - or at least that such an > experience have an important influence on them . this may be true for many linguist . i would like to generalize this observation : it seem to me that many linguist have enter the field because at some point in their life they have have trouble with use language or with communication in general . this could have be while learn a ( first or ) second language . this could have be because of grow up in a multi-language environment or because of a physical handicap such as stutter . linguistic then serve as a ( formal ) tool to compensate for this deficiency . i can vividly remember how i struggle with german punctuation rule in 6th grade and how i feel relieve when i begin to understand the structure of sentence and how this knowledge could be apply to find the correct spot for comma , etc . this start my interest in linguistics and that be how i end up as a ( computational ) linguist . i 'd be very interest to learn if there be more evidence for my hypothesis . martin volk * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * martin volk * university koblenz - landau tel ( + 49 ) 261-9119 - 469 * institute of computational linguistic * rheinau 3 - 4 fax ( + 49 ) 261-37524 * w-5400 koblenz , germany email volk @ brian . uni-koblenz . de * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
