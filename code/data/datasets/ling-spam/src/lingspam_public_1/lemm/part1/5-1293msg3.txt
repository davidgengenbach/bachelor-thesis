Subject: english snow word

jonathan david bobaljik post a message to vol . 5-1276 of this list in which he discuss the various yup ' ik word for snow that have be contribute by anthony woodbury . for the sake of comparison he have a list of 9 or 10 english word for snow and snow-like thing . i think it would be useful to find out whether each of these english word means _ primarily _ snow or whether the snow sense be derive , figurative , or otherwise secondary . i have consult the various edition of the oxford english dictionary . my result be as follow : a . acceptable case : 1 . snow : a good english word with a respectable pedigree . mean primarily snow . 2 . sleet : also good . by the way , be there an eskimo term correspond to this ? 3 . slush : also good . 4 . avalanche : this word seem to have refer to snow avalanch from the begin . 5 . blizzard : the first edition of the oed say , " a modern word . . . . as apply to a 's now-squall , ' the word become general in the american newspaper during the severe winter of 1880-81 ; but accord to the _ milwaukee republican _ = ff 4 march 1881 , it have be so apply in the _ northern vindicator _ ( esthersville , iowa ) between 1860 and 1870 . it be apparently in colloquial use in the west much earlier . . . " the latest edition of the oed have a citation from 1859 . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * b . doubtful case : 1 . cornice : this be really an architectural term , mean the " crown " on a build . it use to refer to a type of snow formation be merely figurative . 2 . firn : this be certainly a very rare and specialize word . the oed mark it " not naturalize " ; its synonym _ n ' ev ' e _ be mark the same way . i would accept neither . 3 . drift : with the mean 's now-drift ' this word be attest c . 1300 , ( " this castel . . quitter e pan snau drif [ t ] . " ) but it clearly have too many other relate senses , such as " off-course movement of a boat " and " gist of what someone be say . " drift be relate to " to drive " . compare bobaljik 's discussion of yup ' ik _ natquik _ 'd rift snow ' . 4 . flurry : this word means primarily ' gust ' or 's quall ' . washington irving be cite in 1836 talk about " flurry of snow " , but there be other case of flurry of rain , bird . conclusion : not primarily a snow word . 5 . sinkhole : bobaljik reject _ muruaneq _ 's oft , deep snow ' , offer " sinkhole " as roughly comparable ( and presumably also unacceptable ) . = 20 " sinkhole " be not in the oed . my understand of a sinkhole be any depression in which liquid collect , especially in the grind . i do not think it have anything to do with snow per se . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * c . special case : 1 . frost : i have leave " frost " out of the english list , since it have more to do with freeze dew and ice than with snow . i have also omit " rime " and " hoarfrost " ( " hoar " be figurative for old age ) . accordingly , i urge that word for frost be omit from the eskimo list . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * d . conclusion : my count be 5 good english word whose primary meaning be snow or form of snow . bobaljik also allow only 5 " exclusively snow-relate simple root " in yup ' ik ( exclude " frost " as explain above ) . i be not a specialist in english etymology , but i be experience at use the oed . is _ muruaneq _ 's oft , deep snow ' really not a purely snow word , as bobaljik say ? i would also like to know what " eskimo " language there be other than yup ' ik for which snow-word be record in detail . david prager branner , yuen ren society asian l&l , do-21 , university of washington seattle , wa 98195 = 09 = 09 = 09 = 09 < charmius @ u . washington . edu >
