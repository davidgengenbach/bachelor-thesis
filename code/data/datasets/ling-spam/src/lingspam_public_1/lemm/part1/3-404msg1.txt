Subject: re : 3 . 396 chomsky citation

linguist have a tendency to think that both they and their field be special . the failure to cite work outside one 's time or paradigm be very general and stem from the social nature of academic discourse and society . it 's just as common in biology and physics as it be in linguistics , or in deconstructionist theology , for that matter . so , do n't worry , be happy . cite sapir if you want to , or baudouin de courtenay , my current favorite , but stop think that we ' re special or choose ( though some of us clearly be ! ) .
