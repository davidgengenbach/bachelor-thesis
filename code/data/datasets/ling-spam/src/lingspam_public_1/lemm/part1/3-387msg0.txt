re guido vanden wyngaerd ( 3-357 ) : i must break my longish silence cause by a few urgent job : > since nyman do n't seem to begin to understand > what the problem be here , let me expand on my question once more : we find > that speaker * observe * ( not violate ) the wh-island constraint ; we find > that they form yes-no question by have recourse to hierarchical > structure rather than linear precedence , i . e . they unfailingly produce ( 1a ) > rather than ( 1b ) : > > ( 1 ) a is [ the man who be tall ] _ _ in the room ? > b is [ the man who _ _ tall ] be in the room ? i must admit my dull-wittedness . sorry about that ! i also agree that a real issue be involve here . > if speaker proceed on the basis of inductive generalisation or analogy > or some such principle , one would expect a more or less random distribution > over ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) in the acquisition stage , quod non . why would a more or less random distribution over ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) be expectable in the acquisition stage , if speaker unfailingly - - and so , as the only pattern for child to base inductive generalization on - - produce ( 1a ) ? > hence speaker > possess a certain knowledge or follow certian rule , and one would like to > know where they get this knowledge from . are you suggest chomskyan " tacit " knowledge ? if so , then you may think that rule grow in people 's mind like biological organ . > the question now be : how can one tell if rule speaker > follow , such as the wh-island rule or the yes-no question formation rule , > be grule or lrule ? where do the conviction come from that speaker " follow " the wh-island rule ? this rule , as formulate and so name by a grammarian , be clearly a theoretical generalization ( grule ) . notice that the phenomenon here capture in insular term be in principle amenable to a different theoretical formulation : e . g . , in dick hudson 's word grammar ( _ english _ word _ grammar _ . oxford 1990 ) , which be a dependency-base approach , ( 1b ) would be rule out by the fact that it infringe the adjacency principle ( not to be confuse with gb 's adjacency ) . while it be grammatically correct to say ( 2a ) is the man who be tall in the room ? , it would be grammatically incorrect ( and nonsensical ) to say ( 2b ) * is the man who tall be in the room ? in my terminology , ( 2a - b ) be technically rule-sentence which exemplify ( and witness for the existence ) of the correspond norm of language ( lrule ) . it be typical of norm that they may be violate by mistake or by joke ( cf . alexis manaster ramer 's [ 3-371 ] post on _ man _ the _ as a [ putatively ] possible np ) ; sometime also by force , in order to bring home a theoretical point [ e . g . ( 1b ) above ] . lrule ( or norms-of - language qua institutional or cultural fact ) be typically learn or acquire by experience . but some norm be so deeply root in human nature that their violation be more or less unnatural and require an extra effort . ( this be one of the basic tenet of stampean natural phonology , unless i ' m mistake . ) for example , anyone stand on two hand ( instead of two leg ) in a cocktail party would certainly violate a norm of socially correct behaviour . in this case , the ' two-leg ' constraint be almost vacuously a norm , because it would be hard to violate it . in the same vein , the lrule of which ( 2a ) be an exemplification , be almost vacuously a norm , because only a linguistic professional could violate it by produce ( 2b ) . but it be a norm , nonetheless . > and what merit be there to make such a distinction > at all ? this distinction be ( meta ) descriptive of generative grammarian ' actual practice . marttus nyman , dept of general linguistic , univ of helsinkus , finland
