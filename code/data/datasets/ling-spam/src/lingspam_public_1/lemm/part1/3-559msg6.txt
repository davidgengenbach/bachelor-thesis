Subject: query : stieber 's law

if i may , i would like to repeat a query i post some time ago to which i receive no response : doe anybody know who first propose that analogical change cannot introduce new phonemic contrast into a language ? the earliest reference i have find be a paper by z . stieber , write in polish in the 1930 's , but i think this must go back further . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - i do receive one response ( from harry bochner ) regard possible counterexample to this , namely , it have be assume that glottalize / y / in navaho be alway of analogical origin . there be numerous other claim example of this in the literature , but most of them appear to be quite spurious ( e . g . , ukrainian and belorussian / dzh / ( voice alveolopalatal affricate ) mention by jakobson , and certain umlaut vowel in swiss german mention by moulton and kiparsky ) .
