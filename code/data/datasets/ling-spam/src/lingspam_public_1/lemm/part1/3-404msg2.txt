Subject: re : 3 . 396 chomsky citation

i think that the large number of chomsky citation in linguistics be unfortunately due largely to the authoritarian nature of the chomsky - spawn linguistics that get do : theory be simply not acceptable until it have receive the imprimatur of chomsky , by his pen an essay or book which incorporate a student 's or accolyte 's idea . this be not so much an impugnment of chomsky : i personally think he be a great linguist ( and political observer ) ; it be rather an impugnment of the chomsky disciple . i gather that the ship of modern ( generative ) linguistics be so terribly toss in the gale of ( what count as ) science that every hand look to the captain for guidance . and so , too often , the captain wear a halo . i think that chomsky would be cite less if linguistics be either more of a science than it be or at least more than its practitioner seem to believe .
