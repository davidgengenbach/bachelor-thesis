Subject: base generate adjunct

doe anyone know of reference on what mechanism be use to encode restriction on the base generation of adjunct in gb ( i . e why adverb occur with predicate but adjective do with referential ) ? seem like it can't be selection if x - - bar theory be an appropriate set of restriction . any reference at all would be lovely , but recent one more so . post directly to me & i ' ll post a summary to the list if there 's interest . david adger adger @ uk . ac . ed . cogscus
