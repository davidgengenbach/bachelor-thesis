Subject: chomsky citation

although i be a faithful reader of the linguist , i rarely contribute . this be a case , however , where i feel i can contribute with confidence , since i be a professional librarian ( and a linguist by avocation only at this point ) . it be clear that the large majority of citation to the work of chomsky be to his linguistic work , rather than to the more political one . i look briefly at the citation to the work of chomsky publish in the 1980 's . i use the three database produce by the institute for scientific information : art & humanity search , science citation index , and social scus . these be the primary source for citation count in all field . note that the citation index look primarily at journal article reference . also note that i do not delve into thing in detail , that i make these count base on short title only , and that i be not an expert in the work of chomsky . overall , for the three database , less than 5 % of the citation appear to be to chomsky 's nonlinguistic work ( remember , these be citation to work publish in the 1980 's only ) . the percentage do vary between the three database : art & humanity - - - - - - - approx 3 % to nonlinguistic work social scus - - - - - - - - approx 7 % to nonlinguistic work science citation index - - much < 1 % to nonlinguistic work donna cromer centennial science and engineer library univ of new mexico info3 @ hal . unm . edu
