Subject: query : sexist example sentence

i know that some time in the past ( the 70 's ? ) some linguist become aware of the tendency to perpetuate sexist stereotype in example sentence ( " john be a doctor " ; " mary be a nurse " ) , lead to the use of gender-neutral name in example ( kim , sandy , chri , etc . ) . my question be : do anyone ever do ( and maybe publish ) a study of this tendency in actual example sentence in linguistics textbook or article ? thank . monica macaulay
