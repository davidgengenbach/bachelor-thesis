Subject: summary : who animal

i would like to thank all those who write in concern the question of whether ' who ' or ' what ' be use to ask about species of animal in various language ( i be sorry but at the moment i cannot locate the file with the name of all those who i need to thank , but i be really grateful ) . the only language so far identify which use the equivalent of ' who ' in this situation in russian , while german , danish , french , dutch , and i be pretty sure ( although my judgement be somewhat rusty here ) polish all use ' what ' , as do english obviously . i should add that i have see many russian linguist ' dxescription of other language in which they note that whatever the language be , that it use ' what ' rather than than ' who ' for animal . most recently , i see this in an eskimo - russain dictionary . i would be interest in hear about any more example of a language that use ' who ' to ask for the species of an animal , as in ' what / who be that ' , when look at an animal in a zoo , or ' what / who bite you ? ' , look at a someone 's swell arm .
