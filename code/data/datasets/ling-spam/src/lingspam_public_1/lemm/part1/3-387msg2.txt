Subject: tone grammar

none of the example mention in john cowan 's recent post summarize response on this topic appear to involve a language that use language solely to mark grammatical as oppose to lexical distinction . which make one wonder about stress . doe anybody know of an example of a language in which stress be distinctive but only use to mark grammatical category . i have some possible example in mind but these need some further reflection , so if anybody have clear example , i for one would be interest ( the example i be think of , which i be not too sure about , would involve tongan and perhap persian ) .
