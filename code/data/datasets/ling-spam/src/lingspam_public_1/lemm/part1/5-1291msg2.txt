re analogy : benjus wald ask syntax teacher to comment on his contribution . i think his characterisation of syntax teach be a little harsh . i for one do not expect student ( at any level ) to accept my ( or anyone else 's ) grammaticality judgement unquestioningly . i ' m sure there be many syntax teacher who would prefer to get student to give their own judgement of e . g . : 1 ) i see the grass brown when i be on holiday in spain 2 ) if you see the tower hazy , it means it ' ll rain tomorrow 3 ) only sherlock see the man lame one may then ask for a comparison with the acceptability status of : 4 ) i see the grass wilt . . . 5 ) if you see the tower lean . . . . . 6 ) only sherlock see the man limp . i ' m sure there be plenty of syntax teacher who would find it important to explore reason why 1 - 3 ) may be less acceptable than 1 - 6 ) on the basis of the students ' own judgements . richard ingham
