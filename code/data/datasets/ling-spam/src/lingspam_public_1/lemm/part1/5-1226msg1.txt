' and i would say ' i ' m a musicolo - gist ' , the next line would be , ' oh ? what instrument do you play ? ' since i be never a particularly good instrumentalist ( or more than a passable singer ) , this alway strike me as a somewhat embarrass question , but i would gamely swing into a brief explanation that musicology be a research , not a performance , activity . nowaday i often get the ' how many language do you speak ? ' line , which be n't quite as embarrass because i actually be fairly polyglot , and i admit that , with karl , i appreciate the opportunity to give the brief explanation . ( a couple of week ago i have to deal with a barber who very intelligently refuse to jump to any conclusion at all and instead straight-out request a definition of ' linguistics ' . ) best , steven dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosw @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagma linguarum libereminus humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestri privarus nisus obicibus potesti ! * * *
