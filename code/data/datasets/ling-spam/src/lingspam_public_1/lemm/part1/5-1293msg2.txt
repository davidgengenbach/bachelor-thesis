Subject: eskimo snow in context

as the quotation from whorf show , he be concern with the issue of whether there be a general term like 's now ' in eskimo language , not with whether eskimo ( or english ) have a multitude of specialize term . it may be useful to point out that in the second half of the 19th century and thereafter one of the big issue concern linguist and anthropologist be whether " primitive " people and their " primitive " language possess abstract term . i think that we must view whorf 's and other ' preoccupation in this context . ( it may be of interest to add that the other great issue regard " primitive " language be whether they possess clearly define sound , since it be widely claim that speakersof such language " alternate " between different pronunication . it be boa who show that this be an illusion , but i think that many people would not listen , and that work such as sapir 's paper on the sound pattenr and even on psychological reality be largely to be understood as attempt to defend the boa position ) . in any case , it should be clear that the issue be never how many word a language may have for specific kind of anything , but whether it have word for the general type or kind . and in this context the only question be whether the eskimo language have one word for 's now ' like english or two like ancient greek or whether they only have a variety of more particular word for kind of snow . alexis
