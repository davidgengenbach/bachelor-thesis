Subject: re : 3 . 421 linguist , human subject

i have the same reaction as martin volk to michael kac 's idea that linguist become linguist because they ' re superior language learner . my gut reaction be that it must be wrong , that we become linguist because we have a hard time learn language , that effortless polyglot pay no conscious attention at all to grammar or any other system of rule . i be about to offer myself as an example when i realize that i _ be _ a pretty good language learner , but i ' ve alway find the process frustrate . i hate learn language because it seem so dreary and inefficient until i discover some shortcut , namely syntax , phonology , morphology , etc . if my case be at all generalizable , then ( happily ) messr volk and kac be both right - - we become linguist because we have some skill at language learn , but we be also the rational sort that think there must be a better , more efficient way to go about it ( and therefore perceive ourselve as have " trouble " with it ) . am i weird , or do it happen this way for other people ? let 's hear more . mark hansell asian lang . & lit . carleton college northfield , mn usa
