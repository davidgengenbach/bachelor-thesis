Subject: grammatical relation

for some time , i have be puzzle by a claim that i come across frequently in the formal grammatical literature , namely that since grammatical relation be derive , therefore they cannot be refer to by the grammar . please note that my puzzlement be not concern with whether grammatical relation be primitive or derive , nor with whether or not the grammar can refer to grammatical relation , but rather with the allege causal relation between answer to these two question . more specifically , my puzzlement be not concern with why some people believe both that grammatical relation be derive and that grammatical relation cannot be refer to by the grammar , but rather with why they think the second belief follow necessarily from the first . to take what seem to be a parallel instance , valid at least for many version of formal grammar : control ( c-control , etc . ) be a derive concept , but can be refer to by the grammar - - so the causal link between derive status and inaccessibility to the grammar seem to be deny in other area . i would be grateful for any enlightenment on this issue . sender : bernard comrie department of linguistic gfs-301 university of southern californium lo angele , ca 90089-1693 , usa . tel . + 1 213 740 2986 . fax + 1 213 740 9306 . e - mail comrie @ bcf . usc . edu
