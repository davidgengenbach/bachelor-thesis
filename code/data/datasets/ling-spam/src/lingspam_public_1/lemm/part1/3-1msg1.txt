" . to say that ' john mcnamara the name ' be tautologous be to give support to those who say that a logic-base semantics be irrelevant to natural language . in what sense be it tautologous ? it supplies the value of an attribute follow by the attribute of which it be the value . if in fact the value of the name-attribute for the relevant entity be ' chaim shmendrik ' , ' john mcnamara the name ' would be false . no tautology , this . ( and no reduplication , either . )
