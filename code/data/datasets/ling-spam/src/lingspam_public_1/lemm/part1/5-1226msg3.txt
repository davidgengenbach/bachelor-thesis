Subject: " linguist / - ician " : a new slant .

i have be quite happy so far to sit back and let the discourse about the relative merit of the term " linguist " and " linguistician " unfold unhamper by any intervention from me . i be , first and foremost , a lover of language ( s ) ; a person who study language ( s ) , their history and their " idiosyncrasy " . i call myself a " linguist " . i may add that i do not myself fully understand the theory propound by those who call themselve " linguist [ ician ] s " ( in the sense of someone engage in " linguistics " , that be ) , nor do i really care what precisely they choose to call themselve ( or their area of study ) . do " physicist " and " physician " have the same argument , i wonder ? ! i doubt it . quite coincidentally of this discourse , enid waus - ching mok ( < enid @ uhunix . uhcc . hawaius . edu > ) circulate recently a questionnaire for information on the term " linguist " and " linguistics " in various language . i happen upon an entry in her summary supposedly explain the two russian term " jazykove " ( linguist ) and " jazykoznanie " ( linguistics ) . these be offer by a certain woody mott also of < uhunix . uhcc . hawaius . edu > : they be so infelicitous in their detail and ill construe in their interpretation that i be impel to reply to this entry and ( as a " linguist " ) correct certain misconception . allow me to summarise : notwithstand the argument whether these word be current or not in russian , i think an explanation of their etymology may be of some use to the general discourse on the merit of " linguist " v . " linguistician " . the word " jazykove " be compose of 2 root : " jazyk " , mean " tongue " or " language " and " ved " , mean " knowledgeable person " ( cognate for " ved " ( < old russian " vedeti " ( e = the vowel ' jat ' ) ) " know person " , pace woody mott , be sanskrit " ve : da " , gothic " wait " , and english " wit " ) . the " - o - " be here merely a link vowl . a suitable english calque on the russian term , therefore , would be " tongue-wit " . this , in turn , remind me of an article some year ago in which " saxonist " term be advance in favour of " latinate " heresy in the english - speak world . thus , we have foreword for " preface " ( the argument here go back to 1842 ) ; bodeful for " ominous " ; birdlore for " ornithology " , etc . , etc . i ' m sure we be bound only by time and our imagination as to other suggestion . mindful of the fact that there be probably many among you who be staunch adherent of the " latinate " tradition , and not wish in any way to alienate or belittle that corpus of english vocabulary , i should , nevertherless , like to propose two alternative to " linguist " and " linguistics " base on the " saxonist " principle above . tongue-wit ( noun ) " a person verse / skill in [ the study of ] language ( s ) " tongue-lore ( noun ) " the study of language ( s ) " i leave it to the individual " linguist [ ician ] " to choose whether these term be suit to their own area of study . i think that the " saxonist " term do have the advantage at least of smack of down - to-earth prurience and a lack of self-importance . a similar term " tonguester " , suggest earlier , be an admirable alternative . i for one be quite happy to call myself a " tongue-wit " engage in " tongue - lore " - - other , i hope , will follow and leave the " linguist [ ician ] s " to sort themselve out . tony hall . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * tony hall * * * department of russian language * * * university of birmingham * * * edgbaston tel : + 44 ( 0 ) 21 414 3227 * * * birmingham b15 2tt fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 21 414 5966 * * * unite kingdom email : a . r . hall @ bham . ac . uk * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
