Subject: on become a linguist

i too have a theory on why linguistics attract many of us . as a field it range from the humanities to the hard science , with the majority of its subdiscipline fall into the general area of social science . i have speak with many linguist who start their scholarly life as scientist ( chem - istry , physics . . . ) and want something which seem more like a humanities discipline ( often in the more european sense of ` science humaine ' , discipline which deal with people ) , while many other ( include myself ) start in foreign language and literature and find we want something more scientific than literary analysis . i think the second-language learn component of it be important , as suggest in a post i read today , but not alway because of * difficulty * with learn a language ; but rather a desire to keep work with language in some form without do literature . on a personal note , i can clearly remember my relief , as an undergraduate , to discover linguistics through a comparative romance course . it mean that major in french make sense even if sartre do n't ! margaret
