" he be a conservative . it " come out " that it mean not politically correct . whether there be legal action , i do n't know . these be the best of my recollection of the story i read year ago . as for myself , i do n't know whether it be pc to deny that pc be pc , or to invert the current mean , or to deny it make any sense . until it be clear up . i will not broach the matter with my superior . i do n't have to , it be a free country : / steven = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the term seem to have enter common use in anglophone canada first of all as social democrat tease of the maoist and the stalinist for their pomposity . " correct analysis " could be use in the same way , as in , " you have the correct analysis , comrade , " for " i agree with you . " this could be say only to other socialist , of course ; the totalitarian leave never get the joke . " politically correct " be - and in safe company still be - use by the democratic leave in self-mockery , as in : " we have politically correct fruit salad tonight , _ no _ californium grape . " the term seem to have become pejorative as it have be take over by people who be incapable of see the comic side of their own ideal . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = but notice that today the american right use the term as a pejorative term for virtually any notion with any kind of ethical motivation . in so do , the right deride not maoism , but the ideology of classical liberal democracy society , where redefinition do not occur by the party run a one-party state , but by free and open exchange of idea , and where ethical concern ( as well as pragmatic concern ) be relevant . rex sprouse [ whose comment prompt my original question - - mam ] = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = i imagine the list be go to be inundate with opinion about political correctness for a while now . it should be interest to see how the linguistics community feel about this issue . i ' m young enough that i be completely unaware of the connection of the term with maoism . i can tell you , however , that it be currently be use on college campus by certain group with no ironic intention . nowaday , what be politically correct be anything , particularly language , that be not sexist , racist , heterosexist , lookist , ageist , ableist , etc . the group fight these - ism tend to use the term quite straightforwardly to refer to what they believe be the only accept way to be . it seem to me that the current situation mr . sprouse mention have result from the near-fascist enforcement tactic of these special interest group and the mangle of language that pc result in , rather than any historic reason . benjamin moore japan electronic dictionary research institute ltd . kawasakus , japan ben @ edr5r . edr . co . jp = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = a few year ago when read krushchev 's secret speech in which he denounce stalin for the first time ( at the 1956 communist party congress ) , i notice the use of a term in russian that could be translate as " politically correct . " while denounce stalin , krushchev maintain a belief in the " politically correct " - - which stalin obviously be n't . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = re : mark mandel 's inquiry about the origin of " politically correct " : ric dolphin 's not politically correct ( 1992 ) confirm mark 's belief that the term originate in the thought of mao tse tung . dolphin state that its first use in the u . s . be by angelum davi in 1971 when she argue that there could be no " oppose argument to an issue which have only one correct side . " then in 1975 , the then-president of the national organization of women say that organization be move in " the intellectually and politically correct direction . " the 1971 quotation seem to confirm mark 's view that only those who accept political authority over the quest for truth could use the term with no ironic intent . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = i first hear " pc / politically correct " in the early 80 use wryly and humorously about themselve by people try to live life of some modicum of independence from agribusiness and the consumption of fossil fuel . i be really sorry to see it turn from gentle humor to the grim tool it have become in the hand of demagogue . f . karttunen v = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = dear mark , i do n't know where the term " politically correct " first enter english , but the etymology you give would certainly be consistent with my experience . back in the early ' 80 i know " politically correct " as a term that leftist may use to poke fun at those whose ( putatively leftist ) politics seem too doctrinaire . later , various writer , commentator , and politician hostile to the leave seize on the term as if it have be use seriously - - in other word , as if there have be leftist ( in the us ) who apply the term to themselve without irony . now , what have be something of an inside leftw joke have be turn into a weapon brandish against the leave . for example , in 1982 , say , a leftist may have blow off steam about some dogmatic person or organization by characterize her or it as " politically correct . " but now i hear the term use by non-leftist , often to evoke an image of rigid leftist / multi-culturalist / academic type take over our institution and seek to control our mind - - as if such a move be afoot , and as if the leave have that much power . at this point , if " politically correct " ever regain an ironic connotation , perhap it will be as a word that make fun of the political right . for example , sometime i hear people call each other " commie " or " pinko " in a manner whose real intent be to make fun of the prejudice of anti-communist . i could imagine that " politically correct " may one day be use similarly . sincerely , seth
