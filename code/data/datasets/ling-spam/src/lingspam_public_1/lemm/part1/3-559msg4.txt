Subject: epenthesis rule

do epenthesis rule ever plausibly epenthesize more than one segment at a give position ? my suspicion be that they only insert a " c " or a " v " , but conceivably there be case where they epenthesize a cc or a vv . ( not an affricate or vowel with off-glide , but two separate segment . ) conceivably there be even epenthesis rule that insert a cv . any example ? by " plausibly " i mean , would a reasonable linguist ever propose such an analysis ( as oppose , perhap , to a deletion analysis ) - - even though constraint x in theory y may rule out such an analysis . please send response to me ; i can summarize to the net and / or send copy of reply to individual if there be interest . mike maxwell phone : ( 704 ) 843-6369 jaars internet : maxwell @ jaar . sil . org box 248 waxhaw , nc 28173
