Subject: re : 3 . 378 korean , l2 , psycholinguistic , german

a trivial inquiry in the realm of new word and why they acquire the syntactic characteristic they do . although the actual command be : telnet cunyvm . cuny . edu , i hear my colleague and ordinary folks use the new verb ' telnet ' with the particle ' to ' , and rarely as a transitive verb . hence , ' i tell him to telnet to cornell ' , less often ' i tell him telnet cornell ' ( i myself have no feeling about the ' correctness ' of this one ) . i have never hear the verb use in the passive , but it can be use absolutely ( or intransitively ) . ' he spend all day telnet . ' . curiosity only . toby paff ( tobypaff @ pucc . princeton . edu )
