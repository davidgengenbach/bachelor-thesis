Subject: book : thoma barthel

would anyone have a copy of thoma barthel 's " grundlagen zur entzifferung der osterinselnschrift " they would be will to part with for a not unreasonable price ? my only proviso be that the line reproduction of the tablet and the list of glyph in appendix must be as close as can be to mint condition . in fact , that be all what i be interest in , and if you 'd not mind part with them whilst keep the rest of the book , it 's fine with me . the reason : my nth-generation photocopy be get tatty , and the first-generation copy fade . j . guy @ trl . oz . au ( telecom research laboratory , po box 249 clayton 3168 australium )
