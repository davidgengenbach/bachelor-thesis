Subject: re : eskimo " snow "

in response to david branner , the point about eskimo snow word be not that there be suppose to be way of describe various kind of snow if one want to but that there be supposedly ( acc . to the myth-maker ) a large number of distinct word with no cover term correspond to our 's now ' . so the example of english have lot of word for kind of boat be not apposite because we also have cover term like ' boat ' and 's hip ' . likewise , mongolian and horse , and so on . in this sense , west greenlandic anyway have two word , one mean ' fall snow ' , the other ' fall snow ' , which be exactly the same as the situation in classical greek ! ! ! ! !
