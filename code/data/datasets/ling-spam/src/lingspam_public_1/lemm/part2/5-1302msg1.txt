Subject: re : 5 . 1265 linguistic as " science "

in reference to the excellent review of " linguistics and the notion of science " i would like to point out one small inaccuracy . at the end of the post there be a quote from a beatle song , * fool on the hill * . while this be credit solely to john lennon , the song be actually write by paul mccartney ( paul can be see sing the song in one of the first " rock video " ever make in the film * magical mystery tour * ) . although lennon and mccartney throughout the beatle career-span share songwriter credit , they stop active collaboration ( with some exception such as * a day in the life * ) since about 1965 . what do this trivia have to do with linguistics ? well , the music of the beatle and the language they use , have influence million of people the world over . as a young boy grow up in indium i fall in love with their music which help me considerably in both learn the english language and appreciate western culture . those linguist who be interest in acculturation ( be there any on this list ? please contact me at the email addr below ) could study global influence like the prevalence of fiction novel , hollywoood movie , tv ( cnn ) , and pop music to account for the spread of the english language in other culture . since the study of culture and language go hand in hand , linguistics necessarily be a multidisciplinary field that would have to include sociological , historical , and psychological approach . to coin a phrase that sum it up ( with apology to albert einstein ) : cultural study that ignore language be lame , and linguistics that ignore culture be blind hemant desaus univ of nebraska - lincoln email : hdesaus @ unl . edu
