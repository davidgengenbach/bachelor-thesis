Subject: q : process of japanese text / database ; word frequency

i be post this on behalf of a colleague who be not on the list . she be go to perform psycholinguistic experiment on japanese morphology and need a number of thing for her preparatory work . first of all she need to find dictionary or ( prefer ) lexical database which contain reliable and _ recent _ information on word frequency ( her main emphasis will be on verb morphology ) ; we already know of one dictionary but this be at least forty year old . can anyone on the list point us to such dictionary or database ? - if not , be anyone aware of machine-redable corpus of japanese text of everyday use ( papers , magazine ) from which she could extract the desire frequency ? our next problem be to find windows ( truetype or atm ) - font of kanj and kana alphabet ( kana would be the more important ) , because these be input to the software that handle the experiment . we be aware of njstar for dos and " jwp " , a ' japanese word processor ' for windows , which would suffice as a word processor as such , but it use an internal font format to which our onversion tool have no access . beside of that have truetype font would make build our own database a lot easier , because we would be able to use windows standard-software , so far we have only be inform of a rather adventurous way of feed the output of a dos database into njstar to print index card in a library . by the way - i have hear of a japanese edition of aldus ' pagemaker - do it come with font ? we would be grateful for any hint and we promise to post a summary . thank in advance christian * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * christian kiss dept . of linguistic universitaet duesseldorf home : universtaetsstrasse 1 neusser strasse 17 d-40225 duesseldorf 50670 koeln tel . : + 49 + 211 / 311-4797 145 / 779061 fax . : + 49 + 211 / 311-5180 email : kiss @ ling . uni-duesseldorf . de * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
