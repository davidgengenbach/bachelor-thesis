Subject: re : 5 . 1370 can the comparative method be apply to syntax ?

i would add to fritz newmeyer 's caveat about limitation to syntactic reconstruction these fairly obvious two : 1 . for many syntactic dimension , the choice be so few that chance resemblance be so probable as to obscure the evidence of common ancestry . 2 . there be consideration non-arbitrariness in syntactic system , so that , again , resemblance arise from other than common ancestry . larry gorbet lgorbet @ mail . unm . edu anthropology & linguistic dept .
