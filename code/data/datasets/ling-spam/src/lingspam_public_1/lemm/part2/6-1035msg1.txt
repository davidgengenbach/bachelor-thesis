( meb3 @ crux5 . cit . cornell . edu ) gerald b . mathia ( mathia @ uhunix . uhcc . hawaius . edu ) larry horn ( lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu ) jack wiedrick ( wied6480 @ varney . idbsu . edu ) almost all my sentence seem to imply actualization , with the follow exception : ( 3 ) be aceptable to many but not all speaker ( dr . horn ) . ( 4 ) imply actualization in the sense that mary get marry on her deathb , or means at her deathb she be still a spinster . the first read be less possible than the second . about ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , the below be the part of my paper title " implicature of _ not . . . until _ " for _ english linguistic _ ( 1995 ) vol . 12 ( forthcome ) ( journal of english linguistic society of japan ) which i write a month ago . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 3 . 1 . nia example ( 5a ) and ( 5b ) illustrate typical case with no implicature of actualization ( nia ) . ( 5 ) a . john be a loyal member of his party until he die . b . bill do n't say another word until he die . ( heinamakus 1978 : 113 ) ( 6 ) a . nancy remain silent until she die . b . # nancy do n't get marry until she die . ( declerck 1995 : 69 ) in both example of ( 5 ) , death block actualization of the head clause . john cannot be a disloyal member after his death , and bill cannot say anything after his death . nia come from pragmatic ( real world ) knowledge . declerck assume that example like ( 6b ) ( and also ( 5b ) ) be semantically anomalous , although he accept an affirmative sentence like ( 6a ) . it would be impossible for declerck to accept ( 6b ) , because he consider that all example of not . . . until must be associate with the sense of actualization , i . e . , not . . . until presuppose the truth of actualization , so that declerck forcibly match his analysis with datum . but not . . . until x die do exist as in an acceptable sentence like ( 5b ) , in which case say another word means $ b ! h ( jexpress in word $ b ! i ( j , although ( 5b ) be also semantically anomalous in the sense of $ b ! h ( jutter / pronounce $ b ! i ( j . beside , some of my informant accept ( 6b ) . those who find ( 6b ) unacceptable must account for the difference between ( 5b ) and ( 6b ) . one solution be that we will let nip work on the one hand as in ( 5b ) and will not let it work on the other as in ( 6b ) . but this solution be ad hoc . the other be that the difference lie in our pragmatic knowledge . even though one cannot say anything after his / her death , s / he can leave something other than his / her word , i . e . , negation of say something do not alway imply say nothing . one can leave his / her message , will or anything else . hence , a rare read of ia : people find his will after his death . in ( 6b ) , however , one cannot get marry after s / he die , i . e . , death block marriage . we cannot imagine the negation of marriage other than not get marry . this pragmatic reason would be more appropriate . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ( 10 ) have also two meaning : ( i ) john keep doze off , but at 6 : 0 he finally succeed in keep himself awake , ( ius ) john go to sleep before 6 : 0 . ( prof . jame kirchner ) ( 12 ) be only possible in the sense that john be go for a while and then he come back at midnight . ( prof . jack wierdrick ) i want to know that ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) be the sentence which can cancel the sense of actualization . the result be that ( 13 ) be acceptable and ( 14 ) be unacceptable . prof . jack wierdrick say that ( 13 ) be awkward , although the right interpretation could be get from it . he give me an example like _ up until nine ( at least ) , john do n't wake up . _ concern the problem of cancelability , dr . larry horn cite his example from his famous dissertaion _ on the semantic property of logical operator in english _ as follow : santa claus win get here until midnight , if not { * earlier / later } . , if then . , and he may not even get here then . he say that in general ' not . . . until s ' , as oppose to ' not . . . until np ' , construction 's trongly implicate a " late " bind which can be suspend . thank you very much for all the responce . i write a very short paper about _ not . . . until _ , which will be publise this fall . if you want a copy of it , i would be please to send it to you by the form of text-file vium e-mail . best wish , hiroakus tanaka , faculty of integrate art and science , tokushima university , japan . e - mail : hiro-t @ ia . tokushima-u . ac . jp ( office ) gca01363 @ niftyserve . or . jp ( home )
