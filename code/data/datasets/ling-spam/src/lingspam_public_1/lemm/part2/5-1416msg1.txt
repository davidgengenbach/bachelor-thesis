Subject: basic word order

this be a somewhat delay reaction to frederick newmeyer 's post on basic word order . i be prepare to let someone else comment on the underlie logic of newmeyer 's message . this do not happen , however , so here come . newmeyer observe that datum from a give language seldom exhibit an unambiguous ' basic word order ' , and there seem to be no generally agreed-upon criterion to resolve this ambiguity . he further note that this fact reveal a weakness in functionalist linguistics ( or , in more polite term , ' present a challenge to it ' ) . he add , on two occasion , that generative linguistics be increasingly come to share the same weakness . by ` increasingly ' he must mean the fact that some application of the principles-and - parameter approach be take both language-particular and cross-linguistic datum into account more seriously than use to be the case . before these development , generative linguistics decree that every ( configurational ) language have some sort of basic word order , as specify by the phrase structure ( or x - bar ) component of its grammar . newmeyer seem to suggest that this type of basic word order do not share the weakness that be ' increasingly ' become a characteristic of generative linguistics . the difference between earlier generative linguistics and current generative linguistics , and between their respective conception of basic word order , reside in the fact that the former do not , wherea the latter do , pay systematic attention to ( cross - ) linguistic datum . newmeyer 's formulation then seem to suggest that not pay attention to ( cross - ) linguistic datum be a strength of the theory . esa itkonen
