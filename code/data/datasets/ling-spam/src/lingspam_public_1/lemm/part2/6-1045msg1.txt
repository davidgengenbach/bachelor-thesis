Subject: judgment fatigue , summary part ii : stromswold , ross , tang boyland , be

asley the follow be what i find to be especially informative quote from four individual respondent who give specific comment regard the type of stimulus which tend to induce judgment fatigue . kimberly barskaitikus also send a long , specific , detail response with many interest example . ( thank you ! ) her response be not include here because it present fewer strong , testable , theoretical claim . ( i must note here that ross and beasley be quote without their express permission , for which i hereby beseech the author ' belate dispensation . i post all comment here in only the most charitable light , with the hope of share the author 's experience and information . ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * > as a graduate student at mit in 1986 , i write a paper on the > phenomenon you describe for a course i take with merrill garrett . i > dub the phenomenon " syntactic satiation " as a nod to work on > semantic satiation ( the widely study phenomenon that word loose > their ' mean ' on repeat presentation . e . g . . , repeat the word > " snow " 20 time and it start sound funny . and you can't come up > with as many semantically associate word like " ice " and " cold " ) . > > the study be n't rigorously do and i never attempt to publish the > paper ( which be call " syntactic satiation ) , but what i discover > be > > 1 ) with repeat judgment , subject ' judgment get less certain and > reliable ( some subject explicitly say they be n't sure anymore ) . > but even before subject ' lose confidence in their judgment / make > mistake , they get much slower in make judgment . > > 2 ) syntactic satiation seem to be relatively specific . for example , > i have my subject make repeat judgment of wh-question ( e . g . , > that-t , long distance , island etc . ) and i find that their ability to > judge wh-questiosn be impair , but not their ability to judge other > stimulus ( e . g . , double object dative ) > > 3 ) satiation do * not * occur when subject be ask to make > judgment about semantic plausibility ( where implausible > sentence involve violation of animacy restriction , e . g . , > the juice spill the child that stain the rug ) > > 4 ) i also do n't get any clear evidence of satiation at the > morphological level ( e . g . , ask subject to judge sentence > with case / tense violation , e . g . , i give it to he ; she give him a book ) > > 5 ) reat of presentation seem to be an important factor in induce > satiation . if subject be urge to go quickly , they satiate faster . > this go along with finding in the semantic satiation where whether > semantic prime or satiation occur seem to depend on rate of > presentation ( at least in part ) . > > 6 ) bee force to make ungrade judgment ( i . e . , good v . bid with no > intermediate judgment allow ) also seem to induce faster satiation > > 7 ) satiation seem to be temporary , although i can't say what the > refractory period be . it be probably less than 1 month ( the interval > i retest at ) > > 8 ) i do n't detect satiation when i give subject mixture of sentence > to judge ( in my case , dative , passive , wh-question , and tense / case ) . > > when i do the light review for the paper , i find a few other study > that look at thing relate to syntactic satiation / syntactic prime . > i will see if i can dig up the paper and find the reference for you . > also , william snyder at mit present a poster ( ?
