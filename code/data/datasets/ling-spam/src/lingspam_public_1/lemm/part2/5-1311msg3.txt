Subject: query : write and phonology

be there many language with contrastive vowel length which dont represent vowel length in the write system ? this do happen when someone with a poor understand of the language devise a write system for it from outside , or when a vowel length language adopt a write system from a non-vowel - length language , but i would be interest to hear of case of indigenous write system that ignore such an important aspect of phonology . the reason for my interest be korean . it be often say to have contrastive vowel length , at least in certain word-pair , and yet it do not show it in the script . the fact it doesnt - couple with the fact that native speaker have difficulty pick which word have the long vowel - seem to me like an argument for treat the distinction as one of accent or stress rather than vowel length . but the argument depend on how common it be for write system to ignore vowel length . what do people think ? reply to me and i ' ll make a summary of response if there be several . thanks helen _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ hfraser @ metz . une . edu . au ( 129 . 180 . 4 . 1 ) helen fraser ( dr ) dept of linguistic university of new england armidale nsw 2351 australia phone 55 73 2128 / 3189 fax 55 73 3735
