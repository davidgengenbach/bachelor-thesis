Subject: sum : word processor for linguist

summary of question about numbered examples , etc . in word 2 for windows first of all i want to thank all those who show me how to number example in word and give me other advice . secondly , i want to apologize for not mention that i be refer to window program , and not mac program . most people who write figure that one out , probably from the version number . in what follow , my comment be in square bracket . this be the original question : > i be think of move ( " migrate " ? ) from wordperfect 6 to ms word > 6 , which come bundle with my new computer , and would like to know if people > with similar experience have anything of interest to say about such a move , > such as for example any good reference to look into ( that be not too basic ; > the software do n't come with a reference manual , just the online manual ) . > > two specific question : > > 1 ) numbered examples : wp can set up counter , which be how i deal with > number example . word do n't seem to have a similar > capability ? could that be possible ? how do people deal with automatic > number of example in word ( as well as cross-reference to example ) ? > > 2 ) file manager : this be something where wp be better than word by a long > shoot , but i understand there be add-on for word out there . has anybody > hear of this ? > > 3 ) search software : while i ' m at it , i just get a message about a software > utility call powersearch , by commtech , which have powerful search mechanism > and work in word or wordperfect ( there be two version ) . has anyone have > any experience with this ? ( it be obtainable with ftp ) . windows vs . mac [ there be more than twice as much pcs out there than mac 's , but perhap among linguist the percentage be more even . i ' m not ready to change though . i be quite happy with pcs thank you very much . ] you do n't say whether you ' re a mac or pc person , but the review of word 6 for mac be uniformly enormously negative : they actually port woindow onto the mac ! since we mac user continually have to escape the really lousy window imitation of thing the mac do gracefully , we can't image why they do that ! the macuser review recommend nisuswritier as the word processor of choice now ( and if you be evern go to use alien script , there 's no substitute ) ; but you shluld also look at framemaker ( abvailable for lot of platform , ionclude window ) ; it can number an idefinitely large number of different series , cross-refer between chapter that be separate file , etc . it only be n't woldscript - sensitive . ( version 4 . 0 . 4 be sort of , but be buggy , and in the just-release version 5 , they abancdon it . ) wordperfect vs . word [ the advantage of wp for linguist be definitely the special character it support , though the special font that come with wp ( which be true type ) will work , i believe , with word , so word user can get a hold of these true type font from their wp user friend . ] i be in a similar situation : my new office computer come with microsoft office , which include word . i toy with the idea of switch from word perfect , but after a minimal amount of tinker with word , i have about abandon the idea . the main reason , for me , be that word perfect come with a fairly extensive set of special character , which i use a lot . they include several foreign alphabet , most of the ipa alphabet , character for logical notation , and so forth . word , as far as i can tell , come with hardly any of these . so i have about decide to erase office from my hard drive and install what i really use . numbered examples [ word can indeed number example or anything at all . the terminology be a bite different though , which be why i be confuse . in wp you set up counters , but in word you set up sequences . ] [ several people tell me that they have get this to work , though they do n't all know how they do it . however , after they point me in the right direction , i be able to figure it out . ] you set up a counter by use the seq field ( look in your manual under field ) . field be somewhat like code in wordperfect , they have link to thing like counter ( chapter number , section , number ) or date , file name , etc . one of the field be seq . ( a ) chose : insert / field , click seq , which will give you a seq in the bottom window ; add " ex / n " to the right of the seq code in lower window , press return ( the ex be the name or identifier for the counter , the / n be to increase the number by 1 ) . the first time you do this a 1 will show up , the second a 2 , etc . ( you can set up more than one such counter / sequence by give each sequence a diferent name an identifier ) ( there be many predefine sequence , e . g . { seq chapter } refer to chapter number . ) ( b ) you can create a macro , which then you can assign to a button or a key combination , which do : 1 ) choose a paragraph type you ' ve create which have the right margin , font size , etc . for your example paragraph ; and 2 ) right tab , ( , the stuff in ( a ) above , ) , left tab . ( c ) cross - reference example : very easy . first you have to create a bookmark for an example you want to cross-reference : a ) highlight the number create in ( a ) above ( along with the parenthesis ) . b ) choose edit / bookmark , give the bookmark a name ( 40 character ) , e . g . donkey _ sentence c ) when you want to refer to it , you type , e . g . , " as we see in example " ; then you click insert / cross - reference , click bookmark , click the name of the bookmark , click insert . of course , many of these operation can be simplify with macro . there be many possibility that i have n't mention . for instance , if you want to number the example in ch . 3 in the format ( 3 . 1 ) , all you have to be before you insert the field for seq , you insert the field for the chapter . ] help on number in word 2 come from : numbering examples in dos : you be right , the automatic number of example in word ( . 4 , . 5 & . 6 ) be inexistant which be a problem for linguist since we deal with a lot of example in our text . if this can be of any interst for you i have find an excellent programm which allow me to do automatic number of example as well as cross-reference to example in the text . the name of the program be renumber 1 . 2 and you can get it by write to : jonathan mead ; 356 no . spauld ave . ; lo angele , ca ; usa 90036 or by e-mail jonathan at : izzyt09 @ uclamvs i have be tell that the fee for this programm be $ 15 . for student and $ 20 . for non student . [ i have use renumber in the past , and it work well . it be not as convenient as the feature in word and wordperfect though . ] powerful searches if you be a mac user and be look for super-sophisticate search , try nisus which use grep convention and be the best go that i know of . regard your 's earch ' question , there be a * lot * of stuff available out there , depend on the scope of your intend use . . . . if you ' re just go for personal use on 1 pc , you may want to look at eclipse find , not free , but only $ 99 , last time i look . ( just my $ 0 . 2 ) . [ powersearch seem to be pretty nice . i download it from simtel ( ftp oak . oakland . edu , cd simtel / win3 / winword ( or cd simtel / win3 / wpwin ) , and get the compress binary file powersch . zip ( or searchwp . zip ) . unfortunatel this version have the powerful feature lock , and to unlock them you have to send in $ 50 , which i have not do . the search possibility seem pretty impressive . trees huge advantage if you would make use of it be that you can easily draw tree , use the integral draw program ( from what people say , it sound better than arboreal ) . i keep a little file of tree-part . reference books [ i should say that the microsoft office professional cd-rom which come wih my computer do have all the manual in it . af first , i be n't too excite about these electronic book , but now that i ' ve get use to the idea , it 's not so bid . ] book : i have borland 's runn word 6 . it be fairly adequate . but it do not explain about style and template sufficiently , to my mind ( admittedly somewhat addle ) and it do not have enough information about long document ( master document ) . the index be useless , until you already know what you want to find out . the help system be extensive , though again it be sometime hard to know what to ask it . depend on your learn style , you may be quite handicap without a real manual , but happily there be commercial version available at most bookstore " prima visual learn guide for word 6 . 0 " ( prima publish , po box 1260bk rocklin , ca 95677 ) be an example . on the other hand , it be good to get use to the on-line help , because it 's alway there . file managers what do you want to do ? delete file ? view file ? create directory ? window file manager , while not the best option , offer much of this function , just a mouse click away . also , try word 's find file command ( under the file menu ) i be real happy when i figure out how to do this one : i know you could look at a file in wp without open it , but i be not sure how to do this in word : here 's how : from the file menu , choose find file . select the file whose contents you want to view . if you do n't see the file you be look for , search for it : click on the search button , choose the drive and directory ( s ) you want to look in , make a wildcard filename ( like * . rev ) choose include subdirectory ( if you want to check your whole drive , etc ) , click on ok , and look at the list of file find . to preview the file , select preview in the view box ( still in the find file dialog box . then just click on the filename you want to look at , and you will see the first page on the screen . you can scroll through it to browse , you can delete , copy , open etc . by choose the commands button . - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - jon aske home address : bate college 12 bardwell st . lewiston , maine 2208 , usa lewiston , maine 04240-6336 e-mail : jaske @ abacus . bate . edu - phone / fax : ( 207 ) 786-0589 - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -
