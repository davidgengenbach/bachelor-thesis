Subject: sum : linguistic and imperialism

some two weak ago i post a question on whether linguistics have it 's origin in imperialistic efford . i point to case like arabic grammar , latin and sanskrit . ( the sanskrit case quite obviously do not fit ) o . k . , i put it in a provokative fashion , formulate more sharply than i really have it in mind . the reaction be vivid . the case of indium ( sanskrit ) : it be point out that in the sanskrit case the concern be to preserve the " correct " language which be in danger of bee lose otherwise which would have make religious text unreadable . ( michael newman , karl v . teeter , mechthild reh , european case : generally , the intention be more the emancipation from latin and / or to give the own country a status as respectable as the roman empire . ( michael newman , mechthild reh ) spanish : the first grammar be publish 1492 , before the the concest of america , at the time of the fall of the kingdom of granada . ( michael newman ) nynorsk : the rise and conception of nynorsk ( landsmaal ) in norway in the 1800 be part of the nationalist reaction to danish rule ( imperialism ) . that 's a long story , but nynorsk never succeed in dominate norway , i ' m afraid . ( jon hareide aarbakke ) linguistic as an emancipatory efford : ( mechthild reh , see gupta below , ) the term " imperialistic " : > i think it be inappropriate to use term like > " imperialist " that only make sense once the conquest and > subjugation of > other people come to be see as perhap somewhat unethical . no > one at the time you be speak of would have do that , so > the term be anachronistic . ( michael newman ) are linguist imperialist ? several people ask wheather i be think in that direction . i certainly do n't ! ! linguistic can help to answer lot of question ( see the greek sophistic tradition ) . the question be more to what make any linguistic attempt suddenly bee successful on a national level . thus , my idea refer more to linguistics bee ( mi ) use than bee evil . ( actually , i ' m a linguist as well ) . general aggreement : > grammar book in english come into be in the > 18th century , together with the early dictionary , and > most people say that this be to do with the insecurity > of middle-class english speaker face with a language > that be be latinise . and interestingly , the > british venture to indium and north america i think > also coincide with the period . ( i ' m afraid i have n't > really get the actual date , so what i ' m give be > from memory . ) > peter tan however , as anthea fraser gupta point out , > spenny ( 18c orthoepist ) be a millenarian and an early socialist . he believe that if > everyone pronounce correctly , social discrimination base on accent > would disappear and everyone would be equal . then the millenium would > come , etc . > it seem to me that in general , condition which favor imperialism > in a society may also favor the growth of all kind of study in > that society - - a society which can afford to work on expansion can > afford to support people who be function as intellectual . > i also > think it 's natural that when a society go through an imperialistic > phase , all kind of resource which exist in that society be bend to > the purpose of support the imperialist expansion . marion kee > i 'd hear theory that prescriptionist grammar arise in the unite > state as a way of reclaim the diminish boundry between the > social class . an idiolect today can certainly reflect social class , > so i be curious about the early work . i find in these early english > grammar much more reference to religion and to past glory of the > language / english people than i would have guess . in the 1700 's , it > appear that the justification of use well-construct language > be that language be ( 1 ) an hommage to god , since most early > grammarian > apparently believe that language be a divine gift and the way to > separate man and beast , and ( 2 ) that the earlier idea of latin or > greek be a near-perfectly construct language have shift over to > english ; they believe that proper care of english have succeed in nearly > perfect it , and the effort must continue . tom mcclive > when a new science > be develop , the state alway want to use it in an imperialistic > way . the origin _ per se _ of the science be not imp . but its first > use ( the oldest we can still observe , at least ) be for the good of > the state . marc a . belanger tip for further read : pennycook , alastair . 1989 . the concept of method , interest knowledge , and the politic of language teach . tesol quarterly 23 : 589 . transaction of the philological society 1974 , 33-64 ( under the name anthea frser shields ) university of chicago press , _ the politic of linguistic _ .
