while proofread a translation of a text into english i find a reference to chess as " the game of king " . this expression be a literal translation of an equivalent hebrew expression . the english source i know use the term " the royal game " ( which may well be the source for the hebrew expression , king and royal be derive from the same root ) . in english " game of king " sound a bite off to me . i would be grateful if anyone could tell me whether one of those expression be preferable to the other . thank urus bruck bruck @ actcom . co . il
