Subject: sum : word that be their own opposite , pt . 1

in november , i post a query about what i refer to as " auto-antonymy " , the semantic state of a word be its own opposite , either change its mean through time or have two opposite meaning at the same time . an example of the former be " resent " which use to mean " appreciate " as in the follow quotation take from the oxford english dictionary : 1702 c . mather magn . chr . iius . i . iius . ( 1852 ) 309 if she gratefully resent that small thing for the sake of the hand it come from . 1765 warburton in w . & hurd lett . ( 1809 ) 360 , i be sure that this instance of his friendship to you would ever be warmly resent by you . 1829 webster lett . ( 1902 ) 617 , i shall resent through life ( to use an expression of boyle 's ) your unweary and affect kindness to me . a word that have two opposite meaning simultaneously be " fast " , which means steady , not move , and at high speed . i ask what the proper term for this phenomenon be , and make a call for other example of this phenomenon in english and other language . additionally , i ask whether this a phenomenon that can be rightfully class with other regular form of polysemy ( metonymy , metaphor ) and language change , or be it alway a curious accident . thank to the kind response of linguist around the world , i now know six establish name for " auto-antonymy " , i have a collection of many interest example , and i have be apprise of a dual phenomenon : synonym that look like antonym . these linguistic riches will be share in the follow screen . first , the terminology . dirk geeraerts write that the phenomenon " be know in the older tradition of historical semantics as ( antiphrasis ) or < enantiosemy > " . miriam shlesinger and m . lynne murphy note that such word be sometime call ( janus word ) , after the two-face greek mythic figure . larry horn , renown historian of negation , say the phenomenon have be dub ( antilogy ) by john train in his 1980 book " remarkable word with astonish origin . david gamon offer the term ( enantiodromium ) for : the diachronic process of acquire an ' opposite ' mean , and i suppose a : word have two such meaning would be an ( enantiodrome ) . i learn this , : by the way , from professor matisoff here at berkeley . bob fradkin note that arabic have a word ( didh ) ( plural < addhaadh > ) for " a whole category of word that mean ' itself and its opposite . ' " frankly , i think that all of these term - - antiphrasis , enantiosemy , janus word , antilogy , enantiodromium ( not to mention didh ) - - be quite opaque to the modern english ear , and the word i coin , " auto-antonym " just say it all , and that 's the term i ' ll use for the remainder of this post . now that i ' ve whet your appetite for some auto-antonymy , here be the example i receive : the top entry , submit by practically everybody , be the classic example ( cleave ) which means to bring together as well as to cut apart . < splice > and ( clip ) , mention less often , operate the same way . another popular word be ( sanction ) , which as a noun means a punitive action and as a verb means to endorse . ( let ) be similar , also mean to allow , but formerly mean to prevent . the latter mean survive in the idiom " without let or hindrance " and in " a let ball " . kevin rottet note a similar phenomenon in french , with the word ( defendre ) mean ' to defend ' and ' to prohibit ' . many mention " overlook " or " oversight " which can mean to look at something carefully as well as to miss something . jane edwards note that german translation ( versehen ) have the same property . speak of german , bernd moebius write : in german , ' kontrahent ' today means ' opponent ' ( e . g . , often use in sport ) [ . . . . ] there be , however , the rather uncommon use of ' kontrahent ' for two party share a contract , like the english ' contractor ' . karen baumer win the prize for send in the most entry . these have be collect by her colleague at the apple newton project . i give you a selection of the one not mention previously : ) > > aught = all , nothing ) > > bill = invoice , money ) > > comprise = contain , compose ) > > custom = usual , special ) > > dust = to remove , add fine particle ) > > literally = actually , figuratively ) > > model = archetype , copy ) > > moot = debatable , academic ) > > note = promise to pay , money ) > > peer = noble , person of equal rank ) > > put = lay , throw ) > > puzzle = pose problem , solve problem ) > > quantum = very small , very large ( quantum leap ) ) > > ravel = entangle , disentangle ) > > resign = to quit , to sign up again ) > > sanguine = murderous , optimistic ) > > scan = to examine closely , to glance at quickly ) > > set = fix , flow ) > > skin = to cover with , remove outer cover ) > > strike = miss ( baseball ) , hit ) > > table = propose [ british ] , set aside ) > > temper = calmness , passion ) > > trim = cut thing off , put thing on ) > > a very short list of homophone : ) > > aural , oral = hear , speak ) > > raise , raze = erect , tear down ) > > ) > > a pair of french word which can be very confuse : ) > > la symetrie ( symmetry ) and l ' asymetrie ( asymmetry ) . ) > > ) > > latin : ) > > immo = yes , no baumer also note : an example that come to mind be the word ' prove , ' whose older mean ' to test ' have be pretty much lose , give rise to an apparent paradox in the expression " the exception prove the rule . " there be quite a few example from shakespeare . julie vonwiller explain , ( presently ) in shakespeare mean ' immediately ' wherea now it means ' not immediately but i ' ll get round to it ' . roger hurwitz remind us of shakespeare 's ( nunnery ) , which , in the phrase " get thee to a nunnery " refer not to a place of piety , but a house of ill repute . sue blackwell , point me to " as you like it " , wherein jacque de boy complain : " rumination wrap me in a most ( humourous ) sadness . " not at all funny . blackwell add that ( silly ) use to mean " bless " . here be some example in other language that have no parallel in english : an example from dutch : " ettelijk " . most native speaker ( everybody ) think it means " many , much " , but the authoritative dictionary ( van dale ) say it means " ( a ) little , ( a ) few " . or at least that be what the dictionary say 10 or 15 year ago ( and our professor of dutch use to " catch " us on this one ) . now for the sake of this message i go to look again in a new version of van dale and it say both ! see the evolution ? - - patricia haegeman a swedish example be the verb " maximera " ( ' maximize ' ) . the traditional mean be 's et an upper limit to ' , but now it be also be use in the sense ' make as large as possible ' , probably due to english influence . - - mats eeg-olofsson there 's a strange case in the sahidic dialect of coptic : " ehraus " means both " upward " and " downward " . the former derive from egyptian h . ry " upper part " ( in which h . represent a pharyngial fricative ) , the latter derive from egyptian h _ ry " lower part " ( in which h _ be probably a palatal fricative ) . the distinction between h . and h _ be lose in coptic . - - lance eccles , maquarie university , australium i think that 's enough for now . in a future post i will summarize the linguistic wisdom on the regularity of the phenomenon . - - alex eulenberg ( aeulenbe @ indiana . edu ) - - indiana university
