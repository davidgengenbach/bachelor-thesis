in february , anna morpurgo davy ( morpurgo @ vax . ox . ac . uk ) mention lepschy and give 3 reference ; i wish to mention one further one : lepschy , guilio ( 1982 ) . linguistic historiography . in david crystal ( ed . ) linguistic controversy : essay in linguistic theory and practice in honour of f . r . palmer . london : edward arnold . in discuss carl abel 's _ gegensinn der urworte _ ( 1884 ) and relate work lepschy write : " hbe [ i . e . , abel 's ] theory on the importance and interest of word with opposite meaning ( which be , he suggest , particularly frequent in the early stage of language ) find its place in a long tradition of study , from the stoic 's grammar and the etymology _ e contrario _ [ . . . ] , to the chapter in arab linguistic tradition devote to the [ . . . ] contrary , or word of opposite meaning [ . . . ] to the medieval jewish grammarian ' discussion on parallel phenomenon in hebrew [ . . . ] to christian biblical scholar who at least since the 17th century examine case of ' enantiosemy ' in the sacr , classical , and modern language , comment on word like hebrew _ berekh _ ' he bless ' and ' he curse ' , greek _ argo 's _ 's wift ' and 's low ' , latin _ altus _ ' high ' and 'd eep ' [ . . . ] nearer to abel , in the first part of the 19th century , we find the german romantic meditate on opposite meaning [ . . . ] and it be impossible not to remember hegel 's comment on a key term in his logic , _ aufheben _ , which means both ' to eliminate ' and ' to preserve ' , illustrate a coexistence in language of opposite meaning which have great speculative import . " lepschy also write that abel 's idea " be take seriously by people of the calibre of pott , steinthal , and schuchardt " , and that freud repeatedly quote abel 's work , view it " as a linguistic confirmation " of his own theory that " for the unconscious , opposite be equivalent to each other . " ( pp . 28-29 ) surprisingly broad historically , i think . in this chapter lepschy bemoan the more general lack of a comprehensive historiography of linguistics . - jane edward ( edward @ cogscus . berkeley . edu )
