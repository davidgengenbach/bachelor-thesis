Subject: 2nd cfp : ijhcs special issue

call for paper the international journal of human - computer study will publish a special issue on the theme collaboration , cooperation and conflict in dialogue system = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = this special issue be devote to theoretical and empirical study of cooperation and collaboration in dialogue system , address problem specific to dialogue management . it be associate with the workshop on the same theme hold at ijcai-97 in nagoya but seek submission from all researcher who have be work on the topic , not just the workshop participant . work on autonomous cooperative system have show the importance of collaboration in different domain : beside collaborate with user to provide request information and to solve their problem , the system should also be able to collaborate with other specialist intelligent system ( as in multi-agent infrastructure , for example ) . also , research in natural language dialogue have bring new insight about collaboration : how mutual belief be establish in dialogue ( and , consequently , task ) fulfillment , as well as how to cooperate to enable successful communication between the conversant . the notion of cooperation and collaboration be closely relate to each other , but likely not the same : cooperation be one of the design principle for dialogue system , but such system do not necessarily collaborate with the user . to what degree be cooperation necessary for collaboration and how do it appear in dialogue ? cooperation turn into benevolence if the agent attempt to fulfill the partner 's goal without question their contextual relevance , but this be not necessarily collaboration . on the other hand , if the agent pursue their own goal without consider those of their partner or the join task , their action can hardly be describe as cooperative or collaborative . this special issue concentrate on human-human and human-computer communication , and on the way cooperation and collaboration be manifest in these situation : how the partner jointly construct dialogue act , infer non-explicitly express intention , negotiate appropriate reference , generate cooperative answer , co-produce utterance , give feedback , help each other in task achievement , etc . since collaboration and cooperation be also relate to conflict situation , arise from misunderstanding , erroneous perception , partial knowledge , false belief , etc . , submission that examine how cooperation and collaboration work in solve conflict , and how the partner negotiate to reach a mutually acceptable resolution be also welcome . we encourage submission on different aspect of cooperation and collaboration , address especially one or more of the follow research issue : - how can we define " collaborative dialogue " ? are all dialogue collaborative ? how do corpus study back up the classification ? - what kind of individual commitment be need for collaboration ? how do social setting ( role , acquaintance ) affect communication and collaboration ? how be these commitment and setting represent in a dialogue model ? - what be the role of cooperation in collaborative dialogue ? can collaborative activity include benevolent or uncooperative behaviour ? doe collaboration require sincerity ( e . g . , can cheat be collaborative ) ? - how do collaboration contribute to conflict resolution and recovery from misunderstanding ? how can cost and benefit of collaboration be measure ? - how be collaboration and cooperation relate to task performance ? what mechanism be need to combine collaborative task plan with dialogue contribution ? - how can cooperation / collaboration principle and mechanism be express in formal , computational model of communication or interaction ? how can these model be implement ? - is collaboration the main issue to problem in dialogue management ? what be the solution , future research problem ? both theoretical and more practically orient papers be welcome , but we encourage papers that provide real-world example of collaboration , cooperation and conflict , and compare multiple way of address the problem that arise . submission of papers full paper submission to the special issue should be in the ijhcs format . information for the ijhcs author can be find at : http : / / ksus . cpsc . ucalgary . ca / ijhcs / ijhcs _ ia . html to help to coordinate the review process , author who intend to submit be ask to send a short statement of intention to submit to david sadek one month prior the deadline . the deadline for submission be march 16 . submission should preferably be send as postscript file by email to : david . sadek @ cnet . francetelecom . fr if this be not possible , send six ( 6 ) hardcopy to david sadek at the address : david sadek france telecom cnet - dih technopole anticipa - 2 , avenue pierre marzin 22307 lannion cedex - france in either case , the author should also send a separate electronic title and abstract page ( in plain text format ) to david . sadek @ cnet . francetelecom . fr the submission will undergo the usual ijhcs review process take into account the requirement of the special issue . each paper will be review by 3 reviewer who be member of the scientific board . author of submit papers will also be ask to act as referee for other submission . the reviewer will judge the submission primarily along the follow dimension : relevance , significance , originality , clarity , technical soundness , and overall quality of presentation . important dates november 1997 call for papers february 16 statement of intent to submit march 16 submission deadline june 15 notification of acceptance august 15 final papers due special issue editors : kristiina jokinen atr , japan kjokinen @ itl . atr . co . jp david sadek france telecom , cnet , france david . sadek @ cnet . francetelecom . fr david r . traum university of maryland , usa traum @ c . umd . edu special issue scientific board : jame allen , university of rochester , usa jen allwood , university of g \ " { o } teborg , sweden michael baker , university lyon ii , france jennifer chu - carroll , bell laboratory , usa patrick healey , atr , japan graeme hirst , university of toronto , canada masato ishizakus , ntt , japan karen lochbaum , us west , usa susan mcroy , university of wisconsin - milwaukee , usa david novick , eurisco , france candace sidner , lotus development corporation , usa more information : update information on the special issue as well as the ijcai workshop be available at : http : / / www . c . umd . edu / ~ traum / cccinds / general information on ijhcs be available at : http : / / ksus . cpsc . ucalgary . ca / ijhcs
