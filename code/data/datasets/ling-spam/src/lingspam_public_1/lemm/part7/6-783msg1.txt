Subject: 6 . 524 german affricate

i may have miss some of the discussion on this matter when i be away for a couple of week , but i want to throw in one item if it have n't be in already . in english at least the phonetic distinction between a palatoalveolar afffricate and an alveolar stop + palatoalveolar fricative be patent and unproblematic . in pair like catch it v . cat shit ratchet v . rat shit it be easy to hear the difference , even if the prosodic pattern be the same . in the first ( let 's call it / c ^ / case , the stop segment be not alveolar but palatoalveolar , and short , and the whole two-quality sequence be about the length of an initial voiceless stop ; in the second , let 's call it / ts / cluster , the / t / be more alveolar , a bite retract but without as much laminal contact , and the length of the sequence be like the length of a cluster , i . e . the stop onset be not ' ovbershort ' , as it be in the first case . i wonder if the distinction in german be more or less the same ? roger lass university of cape town
