Subject: re : 6 . 39 have ) of

it seem to me that the use of have + simple past be rapidly increase in the u . s . it 's show up now in newspaper and on television , and , perhap most tellingly , in the speech of acquaintance who i be sure do not have it a few year ago . my first think be that this have something to do with the have ) of reanalysis , but i have now hear too many instance of emphatic " have " to believe this . example such as " even if he had go earlier , . . . " abound . i find these example easy to spot because i still wince whenever i hear one .
