Subject: re : 6 . 249 dick armey 's slip and correction

could someone provide the context for dick armey 's utterance of " barney fag " ? i only hear it once and do n't write it down . my impression at the time , however , be that the phonological environment do n't seem quite right for a spoonerism . one other think : it seem that a binary opposition between an intentional slur on armey 's part and a purely phonological slip do n't represent all the possibility . it 's certainly possible that if the string " barney fag " have be use often enough on capitol hill in the hear of dick armey , he may very well have inadvertently substitute it for frank 's actual name . is n't that something that 's do all the time : accidentally say something that one have hear recently or repeatedly . " can't get that tune out of my head ! " seem like a reasonable explanation for a " slip " that be n't a spoonerism . anythe on non-spoonerism phonological slip out there that bear on this ? phil gaine
