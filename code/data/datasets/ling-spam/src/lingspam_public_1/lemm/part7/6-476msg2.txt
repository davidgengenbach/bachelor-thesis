Subject: re : big v . large , et al

i would appreciate any thought on any difference in mean between big and large as well as small and little . i be attempt a monosemic approach ( at the insistance of the professor ) which maintain that each word must have one mean . we tell esl student that they mean the same thing , yet we constantly correct their choice because they do n't use the right one . how can we tell them to use the right one if we can't tell them what the right one be ? any answer or thought on the subject would be appreciate . my email address be browndeb @ aol . com , or if you think anyone else would be interest , the multiple recipient address [ linguist @ tamvm1 . tamu . edu ] be good . thank in advance . deborah brownstein
