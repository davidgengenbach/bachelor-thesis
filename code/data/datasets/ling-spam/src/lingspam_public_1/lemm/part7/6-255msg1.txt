Subject: re : 6 . 249 dick armey 's slip and correction

i ' m sorry if this be in the original post , but it seem obvious to me that phonological misprocess be not the only possible type of " slip " we could be deal with , indeed , i do n't know the " speech error " literature all that well but " fak " for " frank " seem totally out as a likely error , in my view ( have anyone look at the phonological context ? ) . surely the suspicion must be that this be a privately use slur of representative frank that creep into public discourse - - i . e . , it be a register problem rather than a phonological one . it would seem unfortunate ( just to respond to the " political agenda " part of an earlier post ) if we as linguist refuse to bring our competence to bear on question such as this for fear of be " politicize " . mark
