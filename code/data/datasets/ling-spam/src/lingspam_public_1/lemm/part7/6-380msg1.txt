Subject: re : 6 . 199 ipa

why must this kind of stuff be decide by a vote ? since obviously ipa membership do not equal interest in the matter and never will , all that will be achieve if some of us join the ipa just to force this issue , be that it will be " pack " in some other way than the way it be now , but it will never be representative . why not let the invisible hand of the " market " of idea operate freely instead ? as fewer and fewer people use ipa 's made-up symbol , either that organization will become completely irrelevant , or it will make up its own mind to respond to the " market force " , or perhap some other group will step in and by propose a system that be manifestly better than anyone else 's , achieve standardization that way . i really think that if a few of the top name in phonetics get together with the editor of a few journal , they could probably come up with something . it could also simply come from anywhere else : if someone be to publish a truly superior system and people start use it . finally , in reality , it seem that certain trend be occur anyway and that in particular the resistance to the hachek and the use of the correspond ipa symbol be on the wane . if we can put up with the inconsistency of american v . canadian v . british spell , we can probably do just as well here . and if we be gonna worry about something , i would worry more about those case where te same symbol have different commonly use meaning like ' j ' and ' y ' . alexis mr
