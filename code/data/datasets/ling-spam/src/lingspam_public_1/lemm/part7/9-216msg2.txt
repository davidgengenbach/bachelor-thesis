( creole : collection of reusable object for language engineer . currently creole support only algortihmic object , but will be extend to datum object . ) a common model of language datum resource would be a set of inheritance hierarchy make up a forest or set of graph . at the top of the hierarchy would be very general abstraction from resource ( e . g . lexicon be about word ) ; at the leave would be datum item that be specific to individual resource . programmatic access would be available at all level , allow the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an excite element of the work could be to provide algorithm to dynamically merge common resource ( e . g . connect wordnet to celex ) , what we ' re suggest initially be not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to exist resource . this be not a new standard initiative , but a way to build on previous initiative . of course , the production of a common model that fully express all the subtlety of all resource would be a large undertake , but we believe that it can be do incrementally , with useful result at each stage . early version will stop decompose the object structure of resource at a fairly high level , leave the developer to handle the datum structure native to the resource at the leave of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucure . draft program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilk hamish cunningham wim peter remus zajac roberta catizone paolum velardus maria teresa pazienza louise guthrie roberto basilus brun boguraev sergeus nirenburg jame pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum paper submission - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - formatting guidelines : paper should not exceed 4000 word or 10 page . hard copies : three hard copy should be send to : gill callaghan , fao yorick wilk dept . computer science university of sheffield regent court 211 portobello st . , sheffield s1 4dp uk electronic submission : electronic submission will be allow in poscript or html . an ftp site will be available on demand . author should send an info email to ( hamish cunningham - hamish @ dc . shef . ac . uk ) even if they submit in paper form . an electronic submission should be accompany by a plain ascius text . # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # pages : number of page # files : name of file ( if also submit electronically ) # note : anythe you 'd like to add # keys : keyword # email : email of the first author # abstr : abstract of the paper # . . . . . . important dates paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) march 15th 1998 paper notification april 1st camera - ready paper due may 1st dalr workshop may 27st
