o what be sound methodology for relate discourse relation with potential realization ? o are there discourse relation that be alway lexically signal ? are there any that be never lexically signal ? o what non-lexical ( i . e . , syntactic or prosodic ) means be use to signal a relation ? o in production , how do one decide whether to signal a relation at all ? o in production , how do one motivate a choice among candidate signal for a give relation ? o in production , how do the choice of signal interact with other decision ( in particular , those of linearize some tree or graph structure ) ? o in analysis , be it possible to reliably infer discourse relation from surface cue ? o in analysis , how can one disambiguate polysemous signal such as " and " , " since " ( temporal or causal ) etc . ? o what be useful lexical representation of discourse marker , for both analysis and production ? o what be useful representation of discourse relation ( and the entity they relate ) , such that they facilitate the realization decision ? what feature would one like to have handy in a representation so that choice can be make easily ? o are there significant difference between realization in speak and write language ? o how do individual language differ in term of any of the above issue ?
