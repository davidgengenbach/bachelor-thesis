Subject: re : 6 . 249 dick armey 's slip and correction

slur . . . i mean , sir : armey 's slip could very well have be a slip , but a slip of this sort represent a compete plan , and one can then ask , why the compete plan ? phonological similarity ( " similarity " be the aristotean catch-all ) [ / fraenk / v . / faeg / ] or something more like bernie baar 's " unintentional " pun , clearly indicate something a bite more than raw phonological similarity . the non-phonological , compete plan notion bring up all sort of interpretive issue concern why armey may or may not have have something painfully abusive " on his mind " when he produce " fag . " if it have be " on his mind , " it be ( at that point in time during on-line speech ) not anything typically volitional and intentional . these be tricky issue .
