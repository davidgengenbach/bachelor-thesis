Subject: currency name

doe anybody know the etymology of the follow currency name : rial ( irun , oman , north yeman ) riyal ( saudus arabium , quatar ) riel ( cambodium ) real ( brazil ) and maybe other similar name begin with rus / re end end with l ? would it be possible that those name be of the same ( ie . ) origin , originally refer to kingdom e . t . c . ( cf . regal ) ? ( what about the russian _ rubel _ , and the _ rupee _ in indium e . t . c . ? ) it would , in fact , not have to be that strange to have a currency name of the same origin in country as far away from each other as brazil and cambodium , as currency name do not seem to follow any " national " rule . cf . the name _ dollar _ ( in use in almost 60 country ( come originally from the german _ thaler _ , but have supposedly spread out under the influence of usd ) ) , and the many variation of the word " crown " ( icelandic kr / ona , danish krone , estonian kroon , czechish korun e . t . c ) , and _ dinar _ in various ( arabic ) country . thank , veturlidus oskarsson icelandic language institute reykjavmk , iceland e-mail : veturosk @ ismal . hus . be
