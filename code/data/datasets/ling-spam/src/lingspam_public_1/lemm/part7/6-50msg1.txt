Subject: reduplicative construction and polarity

moravscik ( in greenberg 's language universal ) note that reduplicative construction that do not fulfill a purely grammatical function usually intensify the base morpheme . sometime , though , it may actually have the exact opposite function : it de-intensify the base morpheme . i be interest in the connection between this process and the process by which the literal message of a sarcastic utterance assume the exact opposite mean by means of a conceptually similar feature : exaggeration ( of , say , amplitude , duration , pitch , or clarity ) . doe anyone know of any further research on this particular phenomenon ? any speculation ? perhap there be an intimate connection here with the polarity-base cognitive map givon ( in negation in language : pragmatic , function , ontology ) propose ? sincerely , ander lar ander joensson macalester college email : ljonsson @ macalstr . edu
