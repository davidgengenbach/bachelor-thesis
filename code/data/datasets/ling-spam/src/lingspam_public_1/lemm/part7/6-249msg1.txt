Subject: dick armey 's slip and correction

i be curious if anyone be actually interest in verify whether armey 's slip be actually a slip . but since someone have ask what the time delay between the utterance of " barney fag " and his correction : have hear a replay , i would say the delay be less than a second . imo , the utterance be definitely a slip and not a slur . other factor would support this conclusion , apart from the delay , phonology , etc . , primary among them the fact that armey be n't stupid . he 's a ph . d . in economic , and have the political savvy to get himself elect majority whip . only the politically ( or linguistically ) tendentious would be likely to assert that someone of his political skill would think it to his advantage to make such an utterance . what a shame it be to see member of this list anxious to use their professional skill ( or to abuse them ) in order to make a political point . two week into this discussion and only now do anyone actually inquire into the datum . it make one wonder how much linguistic research be drive by other agenda , and what the quality of that research be . . . dave wharton
