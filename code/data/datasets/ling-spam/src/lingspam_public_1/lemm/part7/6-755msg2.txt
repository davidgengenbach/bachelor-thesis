Subject: machine usable dictionary

as you may know from posting i have make to this list over the last couple of month , derek bickerton and i be develop a parser base on a theory of syntax that he and i have be develop over the last four year . we be about to purchase a machine usable dictionary with approximately 70 , 0 entry for $ 2500 . if anyone could advise us whether or not that be our best bet , or where we may find other dictionary , we would appreciate hear from you . we be currently work with a dictionary of under 1000 word , so it be imperative that we obtain a larger one , so we may begin work with larger corpus . toward that end we would also like to find out which text be use in past parse competition and where the result of these competition be publish . we believe that with a few week of work we should be able to modify a dictionary sufficiently to allow us to begin experinment with text that be use in past parse competition . here be the spec the parser . it be base on a series of algorithm that have be four year in the make , but the program require to create this parser have only take 300 hour use c + + . there areapproximately 3000 line of code that take up 150k executable on disk . about 100k of ram be require to run the parser . 30k on disk be require for a 300 word dictionary . an average sentence take under 4 seconds to process on a 486 ibm compatible . since this be only a development version , we expect these number to change . to date , no optimization have occur , and we expect to significantly shrink the dictionary disk usage and the execution time . phil bralich bralich @ uhccux . uhcc . hawaius . edu
