Subject: affirmative 'd o '

i be work on a construction in a cape town dialect that involve the use of unstress 'd o ' in affirmative context : e . g . ' i do go to the hall yesterday ' . no contrastive pre-supposition be intend ; speaker appear to be simply highlight a 's alient ' activity ( there be present tense parallel too ) . although this be traditionally believe to be a ' contact ' feature of cape town english , it sound to me rather like a relic from early modern standard english , reinforce by natural ( second language ) acquisition . the form do occur ( though possibly with different pragmatic ) in child language acquisition ( i have sporadic & unsystematic example from britain ) ; but be soon weed out of the grammar . question : doe anyone know of any dialect ( any l1 or l2 form of english ; child language , early interlanguage etc . ) that have something similar ? ( i be familiar with early modern standard and earlier form of 'd o ' ; with affirmative 'd o ' in ireland and the south - west of england - the pragmatic there be different , incidentally : ' habitual ' be not a function associate with the cape town dialect . ) thank : raj mesthrie dept of linguistic university of cape town raj @ beattie . uct . ac . za
