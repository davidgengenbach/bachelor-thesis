derive ontology ? * how can wordnet be use to develop a word sense disambiguation algorithm of high performance ? * how to extend wordnet for identify thematic role and resolve verb polysemy ? * what minimal customization should be implement to use wordnet for a large-scale abductive reason system ? * is wordnet a lexical knowledge base that can be easily use to adjust information extraction system across domain ? * are the lexico-semantic relation from wordnet a valid base for develop an extend coreference task for information extraction , and what be the possible methodology ? * how can wordnet be mine to find textual imply information and what be the degree of plausibility of the return information ? * what be the approach of use the extensive linguistic knowledge of wordnet to derive the discourse structure of a text ; can it be the only knowledge source and if not , what additional knowledge may be use ? * what be the current performance boost provide by wordnet in the system use it ? could your system perform without wordnet ? * what be the desirable feature of wordnet for your system , and what would be the predict performance increase when have them ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ organize committee the workshop be organize by sanda harabagiu ( sri international ) joyce yue chaus ( duke university ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ home page : http : / / www . aus . srus . com / ~ harabagus / link _ paper / chpt / acl _ work . html _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ requirement for submission paper be invite that address any of the topic list above . maximum length be 8 page include figure and reference . please use a4 or us letter format and set margin so that the text lie within a rectangle of 6 . 5 x 9 inch ( 16 . 5 x 23 cm ) . use classical font such as time roman or computer modern , 11 to 12 point for text , 14 to 16 point for heading and title . latex user be encourage to use the style file provide by acl : http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / colaclsub . sty paper can be submit either electronically in postscript format , or as hardcopy . submission should be send to : sanda harabagiu sri international 333 ravenswood ave menlo park , ca 94025 u . s . a .
