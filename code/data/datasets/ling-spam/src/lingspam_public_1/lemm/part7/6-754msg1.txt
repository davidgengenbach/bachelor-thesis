Subject: qs : ideal reference grammar

content - length : 15848 dear fellow linguist , if you be a user of reference grammar and be will to invest some seven or ten minute , you can contribute to shape the format of an electronic framework for reference grammar we be about to develop . we be eager to have your opinion on what a good reference grammar should look like . for that purpose we have formulate a set of multiple choice question plus some open question , divide into four major group : quantity , quality , organisation , ergonomy of reference grammar . if you have more than ten minute , we would be happy to have your reaction also to the star question at the end of each group . the linear order of the question do not correspond to a degree of relevance for us or the project . at the end of the questionnaire we ask you for your opinion on the relative importance of the different factor . to answer the multiple choice question , please type an ' x ' between the appropriate pair of bracket . square bracket ' [ ] ' indicate that you should choose only one of the answer to the give question , parenthesis ' ( ) ' indicate that you may choose several answer . subquestion be mark by inden - tation : if you have check the superordinate question , please answer the subquestion as well . we will post a summary as soon as your answer have be evaluate . please send the complete questionnaire to the follow address : pichler @ informatik . uni-muenchen . de thank you very much for your cooperation , the munich avg team roman pichler christian stroemsdoerfer vladimir tourovsky dietmar zaefferer = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 1 quantity = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 1 . 1 what do you expect a good reference grammar to contain ?

[ ] no justification of the statement be necessary . [ ] statement should be exemplify with real-world example . [ ] statement should be explain ( make plausible ) .
