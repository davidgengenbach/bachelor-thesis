- but how can we perceive those regularity ? - and how do we reason on the basis of that knowledge if there be no observable constraint on inferer ? - but if there be , where do they come from and how be they actually implement mentally ? - and finally : how do we come to act rationally , that be , in accordance with what we have perceive , process and infer . we be interest in all way of define rule and in all aspect of rule follow , from the definition of law , rule , regularity , similarity and analogy to logical consequence , argumentational and other inference , statistical and linguistic rule , practical and strategic reason , pragmatic and praxeological activity . we expect contribution from the follow research field : game-theory , action theory , argumentation theory , cognitive science , linguistics , philosophy of language , epistemology , pragmatic , psychology and semiotic . we would be happy to include some contribution from natural science such as neuro-biology , physiology or brain science . the conference be organize in three major section : philosophy , psychology and linguistics with six keynote lecture . then contribution of 30 minute ( 20 for paper and 10 for discussion ) will follow . we also plan to organize a workshop at the end of each section abstract : abstract should be one-page ( maximum 23 line ) specify area of contribution and the particular aspect of rule-follow to be address . abstract should be send by e-mail to : tarnay @ btk . jpte . hu or bocz @ btk . jpte . hu . hard copy of abstract may be send to : laszlo tarnay department of philosophy janus pannonius university , ifjusag utja 6 , h-7624 pec , hungary important date : deadline for submission : march 15 , 1998 notification of acceptance : march 25 , 1998 conference : april 30 - may 1 - 2 , 1998 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * for those concern there be a follow-up philosophical colloquium : john mcdowell : mind and world - kant in analytic philosophy which discuss mcdowell 's recent book : mind and world . among would-be participant be barry allen , michael william and robert brandon . if interest , contact prof . jano boro , dept . of philosophy , janus pannonius university . e-mail : boro @ btk . jpte . hu
