Subject: query : chinese grammatical markers

i ' m interest in any information regard the diachronic development of the follow grammatical marker in various chinese language ( apology for the email-mutilate transcription ) : ( 1 ) mandarin : [ de ] ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) ( 2 ) mandarin : [ ge ] ( the general numeral classifier ) ( 3 ) shanghainese : [ ge ] ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) ( 4 ) hokkien : [ e ] ( a ) ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) ( b ) ( the general numeral classifier ) ( 5 ) teochew : [ kaus ] ( a ) ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) ( b ) ( the general numeral classifier ) ( 6 ) cantonese : [ ge ] ( the " genitive " / " relative " marker ) [ go ] ( the general numeral classifier ) [ dik ] ( the ligature ) more specifically : question 1 : which of the above marker be historically / etymologically relate to which other , ie . derive from a diachronically reconstructable common source ? ( eg . be mandarin [ de ] and cantonese [ dik ] diachronically relate ? , etc . etc . ) question 2 : ( specific to hokkien and teochew ) most native speaker of hokkien and teochew , who be also speaker of mandarin , be of the opinion that there be two distinct marker exhibit accidental homophony : a " genitive " / " relative " [ e ] / [ kaus ] correspond to mandarin [ de ] , and a " classifier " [ e ] / [ kaus ] correspond to mandarin [ ge ] . question 2a : is it demonstrably the case that [ e ] and [ kaus ] be the respective product of diachronic coalescence of distinct form at some earlier stage of the language ? question 2b : are there any valid synchronic argument for posit two distinct lexical item , ie . two [ e ] 's in hokkien , and two [ kaus ] 's in teochew ? ( i consider the choice of character conventionally use to represent these marker as irrelevant . ) note : i be a general linguist , not a sinologist , and i do n't read or speak chinese . i would greatly appreciate either your own view on the above question , or reference to publish work address these question . however , if the reference happen to be in chinese , i would be extremely grateful if you could provide a synopsis of their contents . thank , david gil national university of singapore ellgild @ nusvm . bitnet
