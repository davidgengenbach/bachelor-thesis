Subject: re : 6 . 108 sum : word that be their own opposite ( part 2 )

after attend a meet , i hear someone say , " the acceptance of this plan will depend on its oversight . " i immediately think of the mean : " an unintentional omission or mistake " ( ahd ) . what be intend , however , be another mean : " watchful care or management ; supervision " ( ahd ) . the latter mean , i think , be become the more common one , but it still startle me . in the same way , synonym may become antonym in compound . " to oversee " be quite different from " to overlook . " i would also point out that nonstandard " borrow " for " lend " be still hear . it may have about the same distribution as " learn " to mean " teach . " up to at least the sixty , english textbook for high school carry stern admonition for both . so these use must have be quite common . finally , there be the famous " bid " of black english , which signify its opposite . antithetical meaning may be common in slang for their shock value . " man , she 's one tough babe , " could indicate two quite contrast , if not opposite meaning .
