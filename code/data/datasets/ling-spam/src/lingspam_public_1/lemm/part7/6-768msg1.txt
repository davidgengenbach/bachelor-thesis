Subject: comparative method : n - ary comparison again

some time ago , while we be discuss comparative linguistics , the question be raise ( by bill poser , i think ) of whether anybody ever claim in print that binary comparison be preferable to n-ary comparison . while i cite one reference at that time , i think it may be still be of general interest to adduce one more , which have just come to my attention . in his attack on the theory that japanese be altaic ( and on altaic as a whole ) , janhunen 1992 argue that the odds of find apparent match simply by chance when japanese be compare to the four altaic language / subgroup , viz . , turkic , mongolic , tungusic , and korean , be four time as high as be the odds of find such spurious match when japanese be compare to just one language , specifically korean ( which be single out by janhunen because there have be a fair amount of work on japanese - korean comparison which ignore altaic ) . in other word , janhunen assume that a 5 - ary comparison be four time as likely to produce match purely by chance ( what i call ' false positive ' ) as be a binary comparison . this , needless to say , be a fallacy , but there you have it . janhunen , juha . 1992 . das japanische in vergleichender sicht . journal de la socus t finno - ougrienne 84 . 145-161 .
