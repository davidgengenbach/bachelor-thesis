Subject: re : 6 . 381 word that be their own opposite

several people submit " overlook " and " oversight " , which be fine example of this phenomenon in english ( though i think that mary neff 's " outgo : retire " be perhap the most elegant submission to date . ) perhap my current work on the various shades of mean in english preposition have bias me , but in any case i think that the difference in the various senses of " oversight " and " overlook " stem largely from their compound with " over - " . " over " be sneaky ; at first glance it seem to be fairly limit in expressive power , but deeper analysis reveal that in it lurk a number of distinction of mean , some of them quite subtle indeed . in addition to nuance of physical location , " over " can indicate power relationship ( both outright force , and more subtle authority ) , value judgement , and the general notion of ( metaphorically ) move on to another thing , as in " get over it " and " skip over " . so my analysis of " oversight " and " overlook " would be that in one sense , " over " take on the mean of authority-over , and in the other sense it take on the mean of skipping-over . perhap a similar argument could be make for the " sight / see / look " part of the compound ? for instance , useage such as " see to it " " look to your own interest " seem to carry some of this " authority " mean . i think the " over " analysis be more clear-cut , but it would be interest to see if someone will make a case for the other half . - - marion kee marion kee | all opinion be my own ; knowledge engineer , center for machine translation | when cmu want my opinion carnegie mellon university pittsburgh , pa , usa | it pay for them .
