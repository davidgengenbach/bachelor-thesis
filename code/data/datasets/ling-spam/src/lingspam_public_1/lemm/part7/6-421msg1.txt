Subject: the ipa market

" alexis mr " urge that phonetic alphabet be standardize , and write , " why not let the invisible hand of the " market " of idea operate freely ? " but the market * be * operate . that 's exactly why we have several different system , any that 's why people feel free to modify those system as they please . i do not see how the market would demand i ask in an earlier egram ( vol-6 - 199 ) why it would benefit me , as an active fieldworker , to have a completely revamp phonetic alphabet . i be still wait for a plausible answer . i be happy with ipa most of the time , and when i ' m not i innovate as necessary . a complete overhaul would be wrench for me and probably leave me feel extremely alientate . more likely , i would just go on use the ipa and chinese ipa symbol i already use , and the dubious goal of a new , unify standard phonetic system would fail . i think the real reason some people want to overhaul ipa be to alter its aesthetics - to make it neater , more symmetrical somehow . i do not see any practical value in this . nor do i see any need to have a single , unify system , replace both ipa and american consensual practice . everybody recognize esh , and everybody recognize s-hachek , and if a letter _ y _ appear in a transcription you look carefully at the introduction and find out what it represent , that 's all . where be the problem ? please , someone tell me , where be the problem ? david prager branner , yuen ren society asian l&l , do-21 , university of washington seattle , wa 98195 ( charmius @ u . washington . edu )
