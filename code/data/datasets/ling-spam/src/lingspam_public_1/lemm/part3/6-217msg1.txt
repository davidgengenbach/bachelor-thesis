Subject: summary of multimodal ref

summary to my query of early january : ) dear linguist , ) ) doe anyone know of work - - study , analysis - - in multimodal reference : ) i . e . how word and picture interact and refer to each other in text ? ) thank to all who response , among them : susan meredith burt , robert dale , karen emmorey , sharon flank , lisa frumk , sabine geldof , jame a . mcgilvray , georgium green , martus hearst , richard hirsch , sally jacoby , pirjo karvonen , john lee , dick oehrle , toshio ohorus , laurent romary , deborah d k ruuskanen , roberta trite , mat wiren . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - the background to my query be that my group have work for some time with multimodal input to computer system , use combination of text and direct manipulation : point and click gesture . just recently we extend our scope somewhat , and we have just complete a first run version of a speech interface to a 3 - d graphic virtual environment . i myself be look at reference resolution in the interface . we be currently in the process of experiment and fool about with it . i be surprise myself at the strong effect of visual focus and interactivity on referent choice in situation which could be construe as ambiguous , and conversely , how in certain construction , the textual effect completely override visual and gestural cue . just recently we complete the first stage of the project . i will be happy to mail anyone a copy of our first tentative report on how thing turn out . this lead me on to a side track : i be currently work on a statistical study of a tintin album ( l ' oreille cassee ) to see how the pictorial mode of the text affect the structure of referential expression . jussus karlgren , ivan bretan , nikla frost , lar jonsson . 1995 . ` ` interaction model for speech interface to virtual environment ' ' , proceeding of second eurographic workshop on virtual environment - - realism and real time , monte carlo . darmstadt : fraunhofer igd . integrate speech and virtual reality technology be be do simultaneously by several research group , and there be several publication from various source in the work . naturally , multimodality in the human computer interface can be more than speech , vision , and gesture , and a fair amount of work have be put into investigate effect of add text input or output to graphical display or vice versa . there be several study make on multimodal aspect of human-human discourse , both speak and in text form , some with an eye on application on human-computer interaction , and some not . several response encourage me to look more at study of child 's literature : the standard reference to that appear to be nodelman , in the follow list . the follow list only contain the complete reference i have be send so far . they keep arrive , so i may post a revise version if i receive enough more material . naturally , the field be diverse and large , and this list do in no way even approximate the breadth and depth of study in the area , but much of the work in it be new to me . i hope it be of some use !
