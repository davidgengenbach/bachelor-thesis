i do believe that many tradition ( sexism be one of them ) and perspective be partially convey through language . however , like you , i tend to believe that language and behavior evolve together . i do believe that historically today 's sexist interactive pattern be influence - - among other factor - - by sociolinguistic practice during biblical time when a wife have to address her husband as slave have to address their master , or subject their king . this imply that a man could also address his wife as a master his slave and a king his subject , i . e . , use a clear rhetoric of authority . today , conversational dominance by male in our judeo-christian society be not as extreme as during the biblical time , but interestingly it be still inherent to male-specific discourse and have become the focus of some interest sociolinguistic research . as a matter of fact , i move to the bible belt one year ago ( i spend 10 year on the east and west coast in the us prior to my arrival in the bible belt last year ; originally i come from europe ) , and after observation of interractive pattern among couple around me , i come to the hypothesis that the stronger a religious ( or traditional ) impact on people 's life , the more sex discrimination be reflect in language use . i have also notice much more instance of sex discrimination in language use in office i have to go to in the bible belt ( e . g . doctor and lawyer office , insurance agency , etc . ) than in other professional office i visit elsewhere in the u . s . i find this extremely interest . > ( a ) i do believe that people in all kind of culture themselve > believe that man and male behavior be superior in some sense to > woman and female behavior , and i hold that this perception ( even if > it be not accurate ) be what must matter to us as we discuss > sexist language . whether the perception be accurate be of no importance > in this context . why should it be of no importance ? shall we just accept the discriminatory status quo as it be ? what be the point of study linguistics if it be for no other purpose than the pleasure of intellectual analysis ? shall we just remain at the analytical level and ignore the implication reveal by research , or could we also use research finding to help improve communication or even change subsconsciously ( socially ) acquire schema ? study in psychology have show that female read text write in a generic " he " retain less information than when they read text use a generic plural . obviously , the impact of use a sexist language go beyond the simple interest of linguistic study within a certain context . personally , i like to believe that my research will somewhat help society at large . what be the point of consider discriminatory perspective as unchangeable or questionable fact wherea we all know that both language and human psychology have the potential to change ?
