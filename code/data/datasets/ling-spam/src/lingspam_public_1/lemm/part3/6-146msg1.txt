Subject: " sycopahnt " and " sign of the fig "

the response to my recent enquiry about the word " sycophant " and the " sign of the fig " be very interest and vary . in view of this , instead of summarize the response i be forward them with minor edit : fig be first introduce in greece as expensive ( and therefore prestigious status symbol ) so that to own a fig tree be a big deal and wait for the tree to come to fruit-bear age and pick the fruit itself an even bigger deal . security be often low ( no electric street light ) and so often non fig owner indulge in steal fig ( it be probably a daredevil act too ) . so , it be decree that anyone catch steal fig be a crime and reward be give to those who reveal ( phanein ) the fig ( syko ) thief . of course , since the pilferer be probably less happy about be fink on than the fig owner , the term ' fig revealer / shower ' take on very negative connotation . it 's one thing to be steal badly and get catch ( 'd eservedly ' for botch up ) but quite another to be tell on : and so go on the lore about how sycophant come to be ( still use in modern greek , as it be in english ) but i cannot swear on its authenticity . at least that 's what we be teach in primary ( athen ) . jenny dalalaki , mcgill university , linguistic , e-mail bgbus @ musicb . mcgill . ca * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the sign of the fig be a highly insult hand gesture use , so far as i know , in italy ( perhap in other place , too . ) it be make by make a fist , with the thumb insert between the index and middle finger . the gesture represent th e female genitalium . a photograph of someone make the sign of the fig appear in the book gesture , a book of some ten to fifteen year ago illustrate and explain various gesture , not just insult one , from a number of cul - ture . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * in dante 's inferno , the sign of the fig be a sign of disrespect , in this case aim at god ( presumably because of the forbid apple / fig thing . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * . . . by the sign of the fig you mean a gesture , quite common in many european culture , where you put your thumb between the first 2 finger . originally this be symbol for sexual intercourse and therefore an obscene sign . ( " fig " be one of the euphemism for the female genital . ) i know from a viennese dialect dictionary that the sign use to be current hereabout , but it be not widely use now , wherea in italy and esp . in russium ( as to greece , i forget ) it be very current now . in russian it have lose its original obscene mean and means simply something like " not at all " or " you be pretend to work while you be not " or " the hell you do " . though not indecent . . still indecent . accord to barbara monahan , ( a dictionary of russian gesture ) , " this be one of the most widely use gesture in the soviet union . . . . it be not at all indecent or vulgar . it be really the nonverbal equivalent of a very strong " no " . ( p . 86 ) ( among adult it can be insult . ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the etymology of sycophant be sukon ' fig ' and phainen ' to show ' . the story be that at one time it be supposedly against the law to export fig from athen and sukophantes often turn in violator of the unpopular law for their own personal gain , these toady be widely despise . in a word , sycophants be originally informer on fig exporter . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the sign of the fig , also know by its latin name , " manus ficus " , be and apparently still be a mediterranean equivalent of the north american " give the finger " insult . it be form by place the thumb between the index and middle finger of the close , fist . interestingly , in the american manual alphabet , it be the handshape represent the letter " t " , but be avoid in the manual alphabet of many country and replace by other similar but less offensive handshape . accord to _ the hand book _ ( linda lee and jame charlton , prentice - hall , 1980 ) , " the / fica / or fig sign be an ancient copulatory gesture . here the thumb be thrust between the forefinger and the middle finger of the same hand , simulate the penis thrust through a woman 's labium . ( . . . ) it be call the / fica / or fig because the insert thumb be about the size and shape of the fig , which , be an ancient symbol of abundance , carry with it a sense of virility and fecundity to the / mano in fica / . ( . . . ) " ( page 70 ) . i do n't know anything about the semantic evolution of the word , but informally , i can see how the present mean of sycophant would apply to the kind of person who would hang around on the sideline of the action at a trial , make rude gesture at an accuse , derive the right to do so by associate him / herself with the people in power who be judge the case . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i seem to vaguely remember from my high school day that a sycophant be someone who keep an eye on the fig tree to make sure that no one steal the fruit . now , when someone be take to court , because allegedly they have steal fig , the sycophant would provide evidence against them by push aside the fig leave and show that some fig have be remove ! unfortunately , i cannot remember why it be a crime to cut the fruit of the fig tree ! were they intend to be offer to god ? that could be a possible reason why they be so precious . i cann ' t remember really . . . incidentally , sycophanti in modern greek means the ' one who present in court or in public unfound accusation against someone ' . this probably relate to the fear of ancient athenian that someone may ' throw ' at them accusation that they would n't have be able to cope with , since a sycophant 's testimony be not to be question in any way . phanti in greek be an agent ; it do not mean the sign , but the person who present something or make something know . for example , ierophanti means someone who unravel the sacr sign of god , i . e . a seer or prophet . modern greek have get both a verb sycopha ' nto and an abstract noun sycopha ' ntium . one last bite of ethnographic detail : it be or at least use to be common practice in greece to cut fig from tree without consider issue of who the tree / farm belong to ! it be believe that fig tree just grow on their own without any special care and therefore do not belong to anybody . thank for the opportunity to switch back to my mother tongue for a while ! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * sykophant ist ein verbale rektionskompositum aus " phaino : to sukon " ( to point at the fig ) , da zum erstenmal beus aristophane acharner 559 ( 425 v . chr . ) auftritt . sein urspruenglicher sinn ist schon in der antike umstritten , vgl . lidell - scott , s . v . : sykophant ist ein verbale rektionskompositum aus " phaino : to su : kon " ( to point at the fig ) , da zum erstenmal beus aristophane , ach . 559 ( 425 v . chr . ) auftritt . sein urspruenglicher sinn ist schon in der antike umstritten , vgl . lidell - scott , s . v . : " orig . use of denouncer of the attempt export of fig from athen acc . to . . . plu . solon 24 , 2 . 523b ; . . . of citizen entrust with the collection of fig as a part of public revenue etc . . . . these and modern explanation be mere guess .
