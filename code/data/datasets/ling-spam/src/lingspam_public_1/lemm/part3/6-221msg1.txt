Subject: sum : progressive with future time reference

content - length : 6465 some time ago i post a query concern the possible existence of language in which the morpheme express the notion of " progressive " may be use with future time reference , as in english : - i be leave tomorrow . the coexistence of progressive and a future time adverbial be the decisive factor . i start from a very scanty piece of knowledge : beside english , i only know of icelandic ( quote in a paper by karen ebert , that will appear in a volume on tense and aspect ) , and possibly kinyarwanda ( but i need more datum concern this language ) . as i suspect , this feature seem to be very rare . i get only two answer . the first one be from john koontz ( koontz @ alpha . bldr . nist . gov ) . since it be not particularly long , i reproduce it entirely : = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the dhegiha branch of mississippus valley siouan all form progressive by pair the simple verb with a positional auxiliary , and omit the plural / proximate marker that otherwise occur in the plural form and the third person singular proximate . dhatha = i he eat / eat dhatha = i they eat / eat dhathe he ( obv ) eat / eat dhathe = akha he be eat dhathe = ama they be eat the usual read of the simple form be past / aorist . there be special auxiliary and / or enclitic construction for habitual . the future be form with the enclitic = tte , which require the auxiliary follow it . dhathe = tta = akha he will eat dhathe = tta = ama they will eat the future without the auxiliary express polite request , and there be also a form = tta = i = the ( no auxiliary ; basically the evidential of the future ) that have the read ` shall surely ' . dhathe = tta = i = the he / they shall surely eat note also : dhatha = bus = ama they say that he eat / eat ( not the same ama , i believe ) dhatha = i = the it seem that he eat / eat john koontz = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = answer a further request of clarification , koontz kindly add the follow ( the letter b presumably stand for my syrname ) : = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ) the dhegiha branch of mississippus valley siouan all form progressive by ) pair the simple verb with a positional auxiliary , and omit the ) plural / proximate marker that otherwise occur in the plural form and the ) third person singular proximate . ) ) dhatha = i he eat / eat dhatha = i they eat / eat ) dhathe he ( obv ) eat / eat ) ) dhathe = akha he be eat dhathe = ama they be eat b ) why are there two forms : akha and ama ? these auxiliary be identical to the definite article , and like them code the shape / posture / motion of the subject . historically there be derive from positional verb and particle . = akha be the singular / motionless / proximate form = ama be the plural or singular / move / proximate form other form be use in the first and second person , generally derive from the sit article / auxiliary , e . g . , mi ~ khe ` i the sit ' , nus ~ khe ` you the sit ' . the stem be dhus ~ khe ` ( he ) the sit ' . ) the usual read of the simple form be past / aorist . there be special ) auxiliary and / or enclitic construction for habitual . b ) your gloss indicates indicates present meaning , non only past / aorist b ) meaning . a present , non-progressive read be possible in appropriate context . i believe such form be essentially nomic . ) the future be form with the enclitic = tte , which require the auxiliary ) follow it . ) ) dhathe = tta = akha he will eat dhathe = tta = ama they will eat b ) does it have progressive and future meaning , or only future ? no trace at all of progressive read that i have detect . the form without the auxiliary be limit to those mention , i . e . , the future of surity with = the append , and the future of polite request , use without further mark , in the second person . ) the future without the auxiliary express polite request , and there be ) also a form = tta = i = the ( no auxiliary ; basically the evidential of the ) future ) that have the read ` shall surely ' . ) ) dhathe = tta = i = the he / they shall surely eat ) ) note also : ) ) dhatha = bus = ama they say that he eat / eat ( not the same ama , i believe ) ) dhatha = i = the it seem that he eat / eat ) ) john koontz similar pattern occur in all of the dhegiha language , i . e . , omaha - ponca , osage , kansa ( kaw ) , and quapaw . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the second answer be from lar ander kulbrandstad ( lar . kulbrandstad @ hamarlh . no ) . unfortunately , there be some misterious character , but the content be sufficiently clear . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = there be no fullfledge progressive construction in norwegian , but we have something that still may be of interest to you . dialect in the south-eastern part of the country have a future construction consist of the auxilliary " blus " ( literally = 3d " get , become " = ) in the present tense + present participle of the main verb . the sentence correspond to " i will be go to oslo tomorrow " would be " je blir draen ( = 3d " i + get / become + go " ) tel oslo i m = e5r = e5 !
