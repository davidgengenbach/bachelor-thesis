" pronounce " quotation mark with two click sound , accompany by the finger sign you mention . this will surely not be the origin , but i see many people imitate him since then . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * " dr . christian k . nelson " ( cnelson @ vm . cc . purdue . edu ) i ' m not sure , but think that what you ' re interest in may overlap with the phenomenon of " report speech , " which bakhtin and his circle deal with . perhap there be a better reference for their work , but the one i ' m familiar with be v . n . volosinov 's ( 1973 ) _ marxism and the philosophy of language _ ( cambridge , ma : harvard univ . press ; l . matejka & i . r titunik , tran . ) . i should note that some believe this book be actually author by bahktin , but bear volosinov 's name for political reason . anyway , part 3 seem pertinent to your interest . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * philippe mennecier ferry @ cimrs1 . mnhn . fr the same phenomenon exist in french : on a coutume de penser que le vrai homm ( entre guillemet ) ne montrent pa leur e / motions . ( your example ) , or the same - by ' imitate ' double quotation mark with * two * finger of both hand when pronounce " vrai homm " . to break off further discussion , we say , as your " period " : " un point , c ' est tout . " it 's lexicalize . je ne le feraus pa , un point c ' est tout . ( i shall not do that , period ) note also , lexicalize : " entre parenthe / se " ( " e " with " grave accent " ) or , better , " soit dit entre parenthe / se " ( by the way ) , in order to express a private comment . ( . . . ) ( soit dit ) entre parenthe / se , il n ' est pa tre 's malin .

" rather than say " as in " : " . . . [ ? aj ? i : ] society , [ ? aj ? i : ] the church . . . " this speak " i . e . " be so common here in the state that , despite be a " highly literate " person , i do n't know it mean " as in " until a year or two ago when my czech - bear teach colleague in europe tell me . i still do n't believe the two mean the same thing anymore in colloquial speech . people here also pronounce " e . g . " for " for example " , " a k a " for " also know as " , and latin abbreviation be often pronounce as write , such as " et al " for " and other " . the french " a la " use in the sense of " after the fashion of " be so commonly speak that i now see it write as a word " alum " . the most common render of the write quotation mark here be a sort of quickly speak compound word " quoteunquote " , as in , " he 's not a quoteunquote * real * man . " ( the emphasis alway follow . ) business office be full of speak acronym speak such as " cya " ( from " cover your ass " ) to mean a nearly superfluous blame prevention precaution or fact verification measure one take when do a particular job ( " do it as a cya " or " this be just a cya measure " ) . " kma " from " kiss my ass " , in ad agency , designate a job people have to do free on their own time , e . g . , because it 's for their boss 's favorite charity ( " this be just a kma so do n't hurry . " or " it 's a kma job , but you still have to rush it , i ' m really sorry . " ) asap " as soon as possible " be pronounce as a word sound nearly like " ass at " . i suppose the classic case of such a thing be the originally military word " snafu " , which stand for " situation normal - - all fuck up " . check this if it 's useful , but i swear i hear people in the czech republic colloquially use the letter of their abbreviation " atd . " instead of the full " a tak dale " to mean " for example " . closer to what you ' re ask for would be the grow use of the phrase " question mark " over here to mean simply something unknown : " this event leave a big question mark over the whole project . " you know , this phenomenon be n't only confine to speech . here be a sentence from the letter column of the january 30 , 1995 u . s . edition of time magazine : " those of us who have to use pcs at work but choose to have mac at home know that mac , while not problem free , be far and away superior to pc compatible , period ! " notice this use of " period " follow by an exclamation point . the word period in this usage have be reanalyse to such a degree that it 's not uncommon in the u . s . to hear emphatic statement like the follow : " i ' m not go period ! exclamation point ! " " period " have thus come to mean something like " in any case " . american also say " slash " to designate " / " : " he 's kind of a carpenter slash bricklayer . " " it 's more or less like a cafe slash bookshop . " " if he slash she have a gender , * i * sure can't tell ! " we also say " hyphen " in a similar way : " he 's an actor hyphen tennis pro . " also do n't forget the emergence over the last 20 year or so of the term " bottom line " , describe the sum of an arithmetic problem or an account ledger , and use to mean " the summation " or " the point of the matter " . in the 1970 i hear it mainly in two set form , the question , " what 's the bottom line ? " ( i . e . , what 's the point ? ) and a main clause " the bottom line be that . . . " ( i . e . , what i ' m get at be . . . ) . now it 's become sort of a complementizer as well , so you hear thing like : " he give me this big runaround about how his wife be sick , and he have to do overtime at work , and he 's get an exam come , and all this crap , bottom line he 's not gonna come . " i ' ve also hear people , who want to end useless heat discussion of something and move on to another point , yell thing like , " wait a minute ! . . . . . new paragraph ! " some of this stuff almost sound like people be think in comic strip image : " there 's a question mark hang over him . " ( i . e . , his fate be uncertain ) . this be similar to idiom that most certainly have such origin , such as , " i just see a light bulb over your head . what 's your idea ? " the german read the comma aloud in their decimal much as we here say " point " , so american 1 . 0 " one point zero " would be german 1 , 0 " ein komma null " .
