as well as the possible contribution of the analysis of time , space and movement in language to the comprehension of the organization of the perceive object , and to the identification of their cognitively relevant property . contribution be invite on substantial and original research on various aspect of time , space and movement , include , but not limit to , the follow . a . semantic of time , space and movement in natural language - lexical semantics : from linguistic and conceptual description to formalisation - from lexicon to sentence and discourse : role of the spatial and spatio-temporal ( s & st ) common-sense knowledge in discourse interpretation - logic and deductive mechanism : * for the computation of the s & st reference * for the cognitive validation of discourse representation b . knowledge representation and s & st reason - ontology of s & st entity : philosophical analysis and formalisation - mental representation of space , time and movement - mathematic of the sensible world - naive physics , qualitative s & st reason - logic and visual reason - contribution to discourse representation c . relation between language and perception - imaginal and / or propositional structure of mental representation - from language to visual perception : from propositional to numerical structure ( image synthesis ) - from visual perception to language : from numerical to propositional structure ( image interpretation ) - mathematical and logical problem of hybrid reason invited speakers ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ nichola asher , linguistic and philosophy , austin patrick blackburn , logic and computational linguistic , saarbruecken mimo caenepeel * , linguistic , edinburgh anthony cohn , artificial intelligence , leed john etchemendy , philosophy , stanford lui farina del cerro , logic and computer science , toulouse christian freksa * , cognitive science , hamburg christopher habel * , cognitive science , hamburg patrick haye * , artificial intelligence , urbana gerd herzog , artificial intelligence , saarbruecken han kamp * , linguistic and philosophy , stuttgart manfr krifka , linguistic , austin carlota smith , linguistic , austin barbara tversky * , psychology , stanford claude vandeloise , linguistic , baton - rouge achille varzus , philosophy , trento henk verkuyl , linguistic , utrecht co vet , linguistic , groningen ( * ) to be confirm programme committee ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ chair : mario borillo , artificial intelligence , toulouse nichola asher , linguistic and philosophy , austin patrick blackburn , logic and computational linguistic , saarbruecken andree borillo , linguistic , toulouse anthony cohn , artificial intelligence , leed john etchemendy , philosophy , stanford patrick haye , artificial intelligence , urbana carlota smith , linguistic , austin barbara tversky , psychology , stanford achille varzus , philosophy , trento co vet , linguistic , groningen laure vieu , artificial intelligence , toulouse format for submission ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ submit papers should be at most 12 page in length and be produce in 12pt ( default latex article style be ok ) . submission should provide the affiliation , full postal address , telephone and fax number , and e-mail address ( if any ) of the author ( s ) . a few word state the position of the paper with respect to the topic of interest would be useful , as well as a 100-200 word abstract . electronic submission ( plain ascii , latex , uuencode postscript , or binhex mac word file ) be recommend . they should be send to tsm @ irit . fr before 10 february 1995 . hard - copy submission ( 4 copy ) should reach the programme chair no late than 10 february 1995 . notification of acceptance will be send to author by 10 april , 1995 , and final version ( camera-ready ) will be due by 15 may , 1995 . these will be compile as workshop note to be distribute to the participant . schedule ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ paper submission . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 february , 1995 notification of acceptance . . . . . . 10 april , 1995 final version due . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 may , 1995 workshop . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23-27 june , 1995 organization ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ organize committee : pascal amsilus , irit michel aurnague , erss andree borillo , erss mario borillo , irit myriam bra - grivart , irit pierre sablayrolle , irit laure vieu , irit contact : tsm ' 95 c / o mario borillo irit - universite paul sabatier 118 , route de narbonne , f-31062 toulouse cedex france tel : ( + 33 ) 61 . 55 . 60 . 91 fax : ( + 33 ) 61 . 55 . 83 . 25 e - mail : tsm @ irit . fr www : http : / / www . irit . fr / activites / eq _ lrc / tsm95 . html
