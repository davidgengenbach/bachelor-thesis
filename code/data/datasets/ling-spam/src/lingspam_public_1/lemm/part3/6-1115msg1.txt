summary : vowel and sound symbolism two week ago i circulate a message on the list ask for information on language with sound-symbolic vowel hierarchy . what prompt this message be a description i come across of the longzhou dialect of the zhuang language speak in guangxus province in southwestern china * . the language have a vowel hierarchy in follow order i < e < a < o < u / w ( unround " u " ) which be manifest in the verb , adjective and measure of the language : the higher up on the hierarchy the vowel , the greater the magnitude or the intensity of the word . for example , ( 1 ) measure 1 . nus : p7 tsi3 ( a small stack of paper ) ne : p7 tsi3 ( a big stack of paper ) 2 . je : m1 kw1 ( a tiny pinch of salt ) ja : m1 kw1 ( a big handful of salt ) 3 . kus : n5 mai4 ( a tiny branch ) kw : n5 mai4 ( a big branch ) ( 2 ) verb 1 . dus : u1 ( to pry use a small tool ) da : u1 ( to pry use a large tool ) 2 . je : t7 ( a small object bounce ) ja : t7 ( a large object bounce ) 3 . ve : t7 ( to dig use a small tool ) va : t7 ( to dig use a large tool ) ( 3 ) adjective 1 . ? e : u3 ( to bend or break ) ? e : u3 bje : p8 bje : p8 ( to break silently ) ? e : u3 bja : p8 bja : p8 ( to break , but slightly louder than the first ) ? e : u3 bjo : p8 bjo : p8 ( to break loudly ) ? e : u3 bju : p8 bju : p8 ( to break very loudly ) 2 . lai1 ( to flow ) lai1 se2 se2 ( to flow softly ) lai1 sa2 sa2 ( to flow , but slightly louder than the first ) lai1 so2 so2 ( to flow loudly ) lai1 su2 su2 ( to flow very loudly ) 3 . hau3 ( the weather be warm ) hau3 je : m5 ( the weather be slightly warm ) hau3 jo : m5 ( the weather be very warm ) hau3 ju : m5 ( the weather be extremely warm ) i ask if there be other language that have similar mechanism , and here be the reply . my thanks to jan lindstrom , stephen p . spackman , hiroshus hanara , bruce a . connell , anne gilman , dirk elzinga , and mark huber . * xie , zhime . 1983 .

( it 's actually a bite more complicate than that . ) meanwhile i suggest you check a paper by ohalum , ' the ethiological use of pitch ' ( i think ) , which appear in phonetica in the early ' 80 ( again , i think ) . he have do other work on sound symbolism , include a recent book ( hinton , nichol , ohalum , ed ) under that name . actually there be two by ohalum , both in phonetica , one in 1983 , one in 1984 . . . in yoruba , rugudu ( hhh ) 's mall and spherical ( as buttocks ) ' v rogodo ( hhh ) ' large and round ( as yam ) ' . if i understand your post this fit in your ( i . e . the longzhou ) hierarchy . i come across it in child 's paper in the sound symbolism book , the original source be courtenay ( 1976 ) . nb both these word be ideophone in yoruba and there be no suggestion that these two word reflect a productive process , even among ideophone ( though i suspect no one have seriously check out the possibility ) . dr . bruce a . connell oxford university . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . shoshonus , a uto - aztecan language speak in the great basin of north america have something like this with demonstrative . there be two set of prefix which can be affix to demonstrative stem ; the first set consist of an [ s ] follow by a vowel and have definite reading , while the second set consist of a bare vowel and have indefinite reading . these be : i ii gloss example si - i - near sit @ n ' this ' se - e - not quite so near set @ n ' this ' sa - a - far , but in sight sit @ n ' that ' su - u - not in sight , far sut @ n ' that ' in addition , there be another prefix which make no distinction as to proximity , ma - . the forgo information be take from a grammatical sketch of shoshonus by the late wick miller , as well as my own field experience with the language . dirk elzinga university of arizona elzinga @ aruba . ccit . arizona . edu . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . you may want to look at my book for the vector space of vowel . the order above be almost a perfect match for a hilbert curve that follow the vowel at the corner of the ordinal vowel cube : hubey , h . m . ( 1994 ) mathematical and computational linguistic , mir domu tvoemu , moscow , russium , isbn 5-87553 - 1 - 4 as in many other scientific field , particular mathematical field be use or have be show vium experience to be useful in linguistics and most book on linguistics do n't stray too far from these method ; i . e . the formal language theory , graph theoretic , or logic . this book cover the area start from the most basic phonetics / phonemics to morphology , syntax and historical linguistics . almost everything in the book be original and use mathematics to model the phenomenon . what be not original be cover in the appendix . even some original idea can be find in the appendix . it 's comprehensive and introduce mathematical method into linguistics in a very strong , natural and non-trivial way include ; differential equation , stochastic differential equation , catastrophe theory , fuzzy mathematics , entropy , various metric space , vector space for phoneme , orthogonal basis for speech sound , and a natural orthogonal space for sonority , vowel , and even consonant , time-domain and frequency-domain relationship , dimensional analysis , partial differential equation and permutation matrix et cetera in addition to the usual binary arithmetic , and monoid , group , ring , karnaugh map , set , et cetera . you can find a free copy of the book on my home page at http : / / www . smn . montclair . edu / ~ hubey or directly try ftp ' ing to amiga . montclair . edu the http be a much better way you can get a copy of the table of contents first . regards , mark . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
