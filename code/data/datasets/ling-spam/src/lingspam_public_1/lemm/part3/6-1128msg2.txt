Subject: re : kinship term

fwiw , i believe i ' ve hear " bro " in hawaus ' ian pidgin in the early ' 70 . i would assume it have an independent origin there . it seem like to be primarily use to refer to those of one 's own racial / ethnic group ( not necessarily kin ) , but could be extend to include even haole ( like me ) .
