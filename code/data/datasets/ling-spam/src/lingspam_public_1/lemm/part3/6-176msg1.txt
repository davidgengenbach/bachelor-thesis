Subject: sum : c gemination ( syntactic )

content - length : 10885 summary of datum on syntactic gemination of consonant a couple of week ago i post a query on what i term " syntactic gemination " , for which i get information from no fewer than 15 respondent . i be very grateful to them all . here they be , list in alphabetical order : list of the 15 respondent : prathima christda ( prathima . christda @ um . cc . umich . edu ) vincent decaen ( decaen @ epa . utoronto . ca ) lance eccle ( lance . eccle @ mq . edu . au ) maik gibson ( llrgbson @ read . ac . uk ) david gil ( ellgild @ nusvm . bitnet ) ralf grosserhode ( afrikanistik2 @ uni-bayreuth . de ) jacque guy ( j . guy @ trl . oz . au ) marcium haag ( haag @ monk . nhn . uoknor . edu ) mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordium . ca ) bruce nevin ( bnevin @ lightstream . com ) john phillip ( john @ ccyus . ccy . yamaguchi-u . ac . jp ) marus siiroinen ( siiroinen @ cc . helsinkus . fi ) norbert strade ( lingnost @ hum . aau . dk ) mark verhijde ( mark . verhyde @ let . ruu . nl ) caroline r . wiltshire ( wiltshir @ minerva . ci . yale . edu ) the term " syntactic gemination " be not specific enough , as i have in mind only gemination at word boundary , and not word-internal gemination at morpheme boundary . nevertheless i will mention such case as have be point out by respondent . beside , in my haste , i have forget to mention classical greek , which i have also take into account in the preliminary version of my paper . here be the datum : a syntactic gemination at word-boundary a . 1 - italian this be the " raddoppiamento sintattico " of central and southern italian . nevertheless the condition under which this appear seem to vary considerably among the dialect ( and the speaker ? ) . for instance , the example " a casa " [ a ' kkasa ] , take from lepschy & lepschy ( 1981 ) be not accept in the dialect of an italian colleague at my university . a . 2 & a . 3 - biblical hebrew and phenician in these language the definite article / ha / trigger gemination of the initial consonant of the follow word ( except for certain consonant ) . for instance , in bh , we have / su : s / ( horse ) , but / ha ssu : s / ( the horse ) . the same would seem to apply to phenician ( see the grammar by segert , van den branden ) , although we have only one epigraphic attestation in punic . the explanation be that a proto-article be reconstruct as * / han / or * / hal / , so that * / hal su : s / ) * / have su : s / , then reinterpret as / ha ssu : s / . this hypothesis have be connect with the arabic datum : the final c of the article / ? al / be assimilate to the initial c of the follow word ( at least for the socal " sun " cs ) . for instance : / ? as samak / ( the f ish ) . 46or arabic , gibson add this : in tunisian arabic there be a clearer case ( @ be schwa ) : shaaf - @ t 's aw - 3sf ' " she see " shaaf - @ tt-u 's aw - 3sf-3sm ' " she see him " the double be do to maintain syllable structure , but this be not the20 normal way . we would normally expect the elision of @ , to shaaf-t - u , but20 this do not happen in the 3s feminine past . a . 4 - classical greek in attic greek word-initial / r - / go to / rr - / under certain condition after a word end in a short final v . in epic text , or in other dialect , this gemination be extend to other sonant : / l - , m - , n - / . we even find / pp - / attest in boeotian these four language be the only instance know to me when i post the query . incidentally , note that they be different from the case of latin " hic " and " hoc " , which be pronounce / hikk / and / hokk / before a word begin with a v . the form / hokk / be original ( and / hikk / analogically model after it ) , so that diachrony force us to say that / hokk / be simplify into / hok / before a c - initial word . here be now the additional datum kindly supply by my respondent , which i paste freely . a . 5 - finnish ( eccle , siiroinen , strade ) there be consonant gemination at word boundary in certain case in finnish . it be morphologically condition though it be " syntactic " . several morpheme or form trigger it : imperative 2nd person singular ( ota ' take ' / ota se ' take it ' ) , allative case ( annan sinulle ' i - give to-you ' / annan sinullek kirjan ' i - give to-you a book ' ) , most of the noun end in - e ( kirje ' a letter ' / kirjet tulus ' a letter arrive ' ) and so on . other example : in some negative form : * en mene sinne * ( i do n't go there ) , pronounced20 * en mene sinne * negation + v - stem + there verb ( go ) 20 1 . sg . the same in imperative : * a " la " mene sinne * ( do n't go there ! ) , 20 pronounce : 20 * a " la " mene sinne * neg . verb imp . 2 . sg . also in the so call " 1 . infinitive " : * ha " nen pita " isus tullum ta " nne * ( he / she ought to20 come here ) , pron : * . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . tullat ta " nne * 20 inf . 1 here 20 the background for this gemination be the historical loss of a final consonant in the suffix-less verbal stem and in the mention infinitive form . this consonant be assimilate to a follow consonant . while it disappear without any trace in an end position or in front of a vowel , the gemination of the follow consonant be retain . this feature be n't mark in orthography . a . 6 & a . 7 - tamil and malayalam ( christda , wiltshire ) tamil have gemination of word initial stop follow word with some case marking ( accusative at least ) . a brief account can be find in christda , prathima ( 1987 ) " on constrain the power of lexical phonology : evidence from tamil " in mcdonough , j . and plunkett ( ed ) proceeding of nels 17 , volume 1 : 122-146 . 20 syntactic gemination be also find in malayalam , a closely relate language . a . 8 - celtic language ( phillip ) the celtic language have " mutation " , change to the beginning of word due to their syntactic environment . type of mutation include prefix of h or n to a vowel and voice , devoice , nasalise , etc . , of consonant . one of the mutation in old irish be gemination . the welsh spirant mutation be historically cognate with irish gemination , e . g . cus " dog " , but trus chus " three dog " , cath a chus " a cat and a dog " , though gemination in old irish occur in a much wider range of environment . some of the mutation in breton be realise phonetically as gemination , though spell otherwise . on other case of c - mutation , see the mention by verhijede below ( fullum , southern paiute ) . a . 9 - the kelantan dialect of malay ( gil ) in the kelantan dialect of malay , agent of passive clause ( ie . " by " - phrase ) be mark not with a preposition ( as in standard malay ) , but , rather , by gemination of the initial consonant . cb : if i understand this correctly , the preposition have be ellipt ? b - word - internal syntactic gemination word - internal syntactic gemination seem to be widespread , probably more than gemination at word-boundary . as point out by nevin , in many language , some phonotactic effect apply only in certain syntactically define domain , for example , in root or in verb stem , but not in affix . hale add that the number of language which show this process be quite large . for instance there be some oceanic example . at any rate , both sanskrit and ( if the meter be to be believe ) and preclassical ( homeric ) greek show such process . here be a few specific instance : b . 1 - classical greek word - internal / r / be geminate to / rr / after the augment or after a vowel in compound , variably . b . 2 - choctaw ( haag ) choctaw ( a muskogean lg of n . america ) have an inflectional form ( for aspect mark ) that involve deformation of the stem such that a medial consonant be geminate , or / y / be insert an geminate if there be not the requisite number of syllable . so we have falama ` return ' become fallaama ` finally return ' while alum ` arrive ' become ayyaalum ` finally arriv e ' . b . 2 - sakao ( guy ) sakao be a language speak at espiritu santo , , in vanuatu ( formerly new - hebride ) . when the direct object be incorporate in the verb , the initial c of the verb be geminate . example , with son 3d to hunt / shoot with a bow , enes 3d fish : moson enes 3d he be fish fish with a bow ( now ) but : mossones 3d he fish fish with a bow ( generally ) , il peche a l ' arc analysis : mv - 3eme p . sg . reali sson20 nes ( ( enes with disappearance of the compulsory article v - , then simplification of the two n 's inro one n ) nb : o 3d open o ( ipa " open o " in pullum & ladusaw , p . 117 ) e 3d open e ( ipa epsilon ) b . 3 - biblical hebrew gil add this on hebrew : in biblical hebrew the 2nd binyan ( " pi99el " ) be form by reduplication of the 2nd root consonant , together with the appropriate choice of vowel . now in most part , the binyan system be consider " derivational " and hence not , strictly speak , syntactic ; however , in some case , the 2nd binyan be the " transitive " or " causitive " of the first , in which case gemination ( plus vowel pattern ) do have a syntactic function . let me end by a more theoretical note , quote verhijde : your question touch upon the field of interaction between morphology-syntax and phonology ( prosody ) . now as far as i know , all c - gemination be in itself strictly phonological . thus if i understand your question correctly , you wish to find out whether there be language that appear have morphological / syntactic trigger for c - gemination . there be a huge bulk of material on sandhus - effect , as for example the italian rs case you mention in your query . perhap ellen kaisse ( 1985 ) , _ connect speech _ may be of some help . now with respect to your query : i be think ( from a phonological point of view ) that c - gemination be really : share melody . or in more abstract term : share [ x ] . if this be correct , then for example c - mutation ( like in fulum , southern paiute and celtic language ) under syntactic consideration may become very interest for you . than again to all of you who generously answer my question . claude boisson universite lumiere , lyon , france ( claude . boisson @ mrash . fr )
