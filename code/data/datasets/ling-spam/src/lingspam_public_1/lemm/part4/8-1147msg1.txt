trento , italy > > first announcement and call for paper < < abstract due : november 10 , 1997 acceptance notification : december 20 , 1997 camera ready paper due : april 30 , 1998 please show interest in contribute to prolamat ' 98 use attach form by : september 30 , 1997 the conference scope of prolamat ' 98 expand design and manifacture issue to include team and virtual enterprise which come together across space and time to develop new product and bring them to global market . manufacture issue and information model have long be part of concurrent engineer ; they be increasingly important in new product innovation and in the development of manufacture plan and process which span multiple company along with multiple time zone . past emphasis on human aspect and innovation provide a strong foundation for the next prolamat , which emphasize three theme in separate track of the conference : track 1 : share experience gain from telecommunication use in industry for agility and innovation track 2 : human and machine communication , model , standard representation , reuse track 3 : telecommunication and agility impact on software technology for discrete manufacture background - - - - - - - - - the prolamat conference be an internationally well know event for demonstrate and evaluate activity and progress in the field of discrete manufacture . sponsor by the international federation for information process ( ifip ) , the prolamat be traditionally hold every three year and it include the whole area of advance software technology for design and manufacture in discrete manufacture . past conference have explore : - manufacture technology , - advance in cad / cam , - software for discrete manufacture , - software for manufacture . the eight international prolamat focus on the theme of man in cim . the 1995 prolamat feature the theme of life cycle model for innovative product and process . the 1998 conference in italy will be organize by the university of trento , school of engineeer and department of computer and managemet science , jointly with istituto trentino dus cultura , under the auspices of the wg2 for " computer - aide design " and wg3 for " computer - aide manufacture " of the technical committee 5 for " computer application in technology " . this conference will be the last prolamat before the next century , and it provide an opportunity to investigate and imagine what the digital communication revolution go on all around us will mean for manufacture . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conference subject - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - track 1 : share experience from telecommunication use in industry for - - - - - - - agility and innovation globalization of product opportunity and manufacture process , along with advance in digital communication , be simultaneously enable and demand agility and rapid enterprise innovation . a number of industry have be drive to exploit emerge telecommunication technology as an important tool for meet these demand . a major goal of this conference will be to complement the more traditional academic presentation with a separate track devote to share industry experience and determine the implication of the emerge digital communication era for discrete manufacture in the 21st century . - case study and description of experience with emerge technology for : - concurrent engineer involve share product and process model , - application of telecommunications for agility , innovation or virtual organization , - distribute business process reengineer and out source , - manage virtual team and develop and sustain virtual organization , - advance in telecommunication technology for collaborative knowledge process for engineer - tele-presence , remote sense , and distribute coordination of process , - collaborative feature model , feature-base design , and geometric model - integration of emerge technology and tool into exist product development - collaborative version management and update share - tool for enterprise integration and manage organizational change - enterprise-wide distribution and coordination of emerge product model . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ track 2 : human and machine communication , model , standard - - - - - - - representation , reuse people , not machine , design new product and make manufacture system work . increasingly , group of people be require to design new product and bring them to market . requirement for agility and the suitability of specific manufacture process must be match with the culture and knowledge base of the work force . world - class process have flounder when this be not do . information and communication system can either amplify or reduce the magnitude of difference across culture or engineer discipline . researcher specialize in knowledge representation , model , communication , standardization , and reuse will be invite to share their experience and research perspective . - enterprise datum share across engineer , cultural , and supply chain boundary , - distribute manufacture and supply chain management - early stage product development which dynamically incorporate supplier constraint - standard model for component information representation , product and process interchange , - technology for knowledge share , collaboration , and across the product lifecycle , - adaptive system for organizational management , knowledge share , education , and train - organizational and manufacture process simulation - organize and represent design and manufacture process for dissemination and reuse - the interface between human and machine for information share , train , education , - virtual reality and multi-medium in manufacture and design - collaborative manufacture process definition and operation - collaborative product and process model for the product life cycle - implication of model of human communication for the support of integrate manufacture _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ track 3 : telecommunication and agility impact on software technology for - - - - - - - discrete manufacture even in today 's post-industrial information-society , machine , not people , ultimately make the product which human have design and will use . digital telecommunication have become an enable technology for agile organization and an important tool drive some enterprise innovation . what be the implication of these profound change in communication technology for discrete manufacture ? which old assumption must be rethink , and what totally new opportunity now exist ? how have software tool for discrete manufacture evolve during these past three year ? the conference , as a whole , and this track , in particular , will attempt to answer these far reach question . - rapid and virtual prototype use distribute team or distribute manufacture , - concurrent and simultaneous engineer system - distribute and global methodology for design and collaborative manufacture - intelligent tool which communicate across the shop floor or across institutional boundary for - automate machine operation , - schedule , coordination , or plan for machine or manufacture process , - architecture , framework , and dss for design and integrate manufacture , - formal design theory and methodology - engineer simulation , product and process model , plan , and schedule - issue and system relate to sustainable manufacture - method and tool for sustainable product development and manufacture process _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conference chair : g . jacuccus invite member to the international program committee l . alting ( dk ) s . ansaldus ( i ) a . baskin ( usa ) p . bertok ( aus ) s . bhattacharyya ( uk ) o . biorke ( n ) k . bo ( n ) m . boarus ( i ) g . bracchus ( i ) d . brown ( usa ) l . camarinha -
