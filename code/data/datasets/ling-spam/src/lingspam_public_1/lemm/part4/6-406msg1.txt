the aim of this colloquium be to take a broad look at many of the important issue in relate machine intelligence to the world and to make accessible some of the most recent research in integrate information from different modality . for example , why be it important to have symbol or representation ground and what be the role of the emerge neural network technology ? one approach have be to link intelligence to the sensory world through visual system or robotic device . another approach be work on system that integrate information from different modality such as vision and language . yet another approach have be to examine how the human brain relate sensory , motor and other information . it look like we may be at long last get a handle on the age old chinese room and symbol grounding problem . hence this colloquium have as its focus , " ground representation . the colloquium will occur over one day and will focus on three theme : ( 1 ) biology and development ; ( 2 ) computational model and ( 3 ) symbol ground . the target audience of this colloquium will include engineer and scientist in neural network and artificial intelligence , developmental psychologist , cognitive scientist , philosopher of mind , biologist and all of those interest in the application of artificial intelligence to real world problem . programme : monday , may 15th , 1995 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * introduction : 9 . 0 registration + sustenance 10 . 0 ` an introduction ' noel sharkey ( department of computer science , university of sheffield , england ) biology : 10 . 30 ` the neuronal mechanism of language ' valentino braitenberg ( max plank institute for biological cybernetic , tuebingen , germany ) computational models : 11 . 0 ` natural language and exploration of an information space ' oliviero stock ( istituto per la ricerca scientifica e technologica , irst ) ( trento , italy ) 11 . 30 ` how visual salience influence natural language description ' wolfgang maass ( cognitive science programme ) ( universitaet de saarland , saarbruecken , germany ) 12 . 0 discussion 12 . 30 lunch grounding symbols : 2 . 0 ` on ground language with neural network ' georg dorffner ( austrian institute for artificial intelligence , vienna , austria ) 2 . 30 ` some observation on symbol-ground from a combine symbolic / connectionist viewpoint ' john barnden ( compute research laboratory , new mexico , usa ) & ( department of computer science , university of read , england ) 3 . 0 sustenance break 3 . 30 ` ground symbol in sensorimotor category with neural network ' stevan harnad ( department of psychology , university of southampton , england ) panel discussion and questions : 4 . 0 ` ground representation ' chair + invite speaker s / in s / in : 4 . 30 ` de brief / comment ' paul mc kevitt ( department of computer science , university of sheffield , england ) 5 . 0 o / iche mha / ith * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * publication : we intend to publish a book on this colloquium proceeding . addresses iee contact : sarah leong group officer the institution of electrical engineer ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . e - mail : sleong @ iee . org . uk ( sarah leong ) e - mail : mbarrett @ iee . org . uk ( martin barrett ) e - mail : dpenrose @ iee . org . uk ( david penrose ) www : http : / / www . iee . org . uk ftp : ftp . iee . org . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-497 - 3633 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-240 - 1871 ( general ) phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-344 - 8423 ( direct ) location : the institution of electrical engineer ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . academic contact : paul mc kevitt department of computer science regent court 211 portobello street university of sheffield gb - s1 4dp , sheffield england , uk , eu . e - mail : p . mckevitt @ dc . shef . ac . uk www : http : / / www . dc . shef . ac . uk / www : http : / / www . shef . ac . uk / ftp : ftp . dc . shef . ac . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-278 - 0972 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-282 - 5572 ( office ) 282-5596 ( lab . ) 282-5590 ( secretary ) registration : registration form be available from sarah leong at the above address and should be send to the follow address : ( it be not possible to register by e - mail . ) colloquium booking institution of electrical engineer ( iee ) po box 96 stevenage gb - sg1 2sd hert england , uk , eu . fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 874 2792 receipt enquiry : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 876 7243 registration enquiry : + 44 ( 0 ) 171 240 1871 x . 2206 pre-registration is advised although you can register on the day of the event . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ r e g i s t r a t i o n costs _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( all figures include vat ) iee members 44 . 0 non-iee members 74 . 0 iee members ( retire , unemploy , student ) free non-iee members ( retire , unemploy , student ) 22 . 0 lunch ticket 4 . 70 members : member of the ieeie , the british computer society and the society for the study of artificial intelligence and simulation of behaviour and eurel member association will be admit at member ' rate .
