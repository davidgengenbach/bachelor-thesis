Subject: summary : c - insertion

some week ago i post a query as to whether anyone know example of consonant insertion to separate impermissible vowel cluster , in which the choice of consonant be not condition by its surround vowel . thank who all those who respond . their name and e-mail address appear with their edit remark . i would welcome further comment on anything bring up in this summary . reason for the query : my query be prompt by work i ' ve be do on the czech verb system in which , in certain form from certain paradigm , a glide / j / appear that be not present in other form . ( since most e-mail win support czech diacritic , i ' ll spell all czech form phonetically . an apostrophe after a consonant indicate its palatalization . ) typical of such verb be the verb [ d ' elat ] " to do " : [ d ' elum : ] " he / she / it do " [ d ' elajus : ] " they do " [ d ' elajus : c ] active participle ( plural ) in old church slavonic and in russian , this / j / appear in all person of the present tense in relate paradigm ( e . g . , russian [ d ' elajet ] " to do " 3rd per . sing . ) and create a vjv sequence , which historically contract into a long vowel in czech ( e . g . , [ d ' elum : ] ) . in most current phonological account of west slavic language , such as rubach ( 1993 ) , this / j / be consider to be present underlyingly , but then need to be delete in almost all form of these verb . this representation seem too abstract to me , and when i consider czech phonotactic restriction ( see chart in palkova ( 1994 ) ) from an autosegmental viewpoint , it occur to me that the / j / ( where it do survive ) may simply be insert to break up impermissible v cluster or to prevent formation of overlong syllable nucleus . the only stick point in this be that / j / often appear between non-high vs or vs with which it shares no obvious feature . as i find out from the response and from search i ' ve do since , the epenthesis of consonant between non-homorganic vowel be not as uncommon as one may assume . so far , the norm seem to be that cs insert at morpheme boundary will be glide ( even between non-high vs ) unless there be a relic consonant that have be retain , and sometime analogically extend , in a give environment . in all case i ' ve find where the insert c be a relic , that c be coronal . more datum would be greatly welcome . the responses : albert ortmann ( ortmann @ sapir . ling . uni-duesseldorf . de ) mention several example : english intrusive / r / , french t-epenthesis in interrogative form , dutch insertion of / j / and / v / between non-high vs morpheme internally ( e . g . , theater [ te : ' ( j ) a : t @ r ] ; zoval [ zo : ' ( v ) al ] " like , as if " ) , and swiss german insertion of / n / between certain host and clitic ( e . g . groesser wie-n - i " taller than - ep - i " ) . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = subj : vowel cluster from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk x - from : spscob @ main . queen-margaret - college . ac . uk ( dr jame m scobbie ) some people may think that / r / sandhus in english be of the type you be look for , but really / r / be just the consonantal glide counterpart of non-high vowel , so it 's just like find / j / near / i / or / w / near / u / . note , however , that to avoid insert / r / in certain socially stigmatise environment , many speaker insert glottal stop : law [ ? ] and order instead of law [ r ] and order = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = subj : c - insertion from : seegmiller @ apollo . montclair . edu ( steve seegmiller ) karachay , a turkic language , have a clear case of a consonant appear under certain circumstance involve what would otherwise be v - v sequence . the plural suffix be - le or - la ( depend on vowel harmony ) , so that at ' horse ' have the plural atlum . however , if the plural suffix be itself follow by another suffix begin with a vowel , an - r - appear : atlarus " m ' my horse ' .

if the final syllable of the stem be heavy ( that be , if it end with a long vowel or a diphthong ) , then - aa be suffix , an epenthetic [ w ] be add . the infinitive ashakataa / a = shaka-ta - aa / ( 0 = get . off - tt-inf ) " to get off " y cheecheewaa / cheechee-aa / ( soft - inf ) " to be soft " illustrate this contrast . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = thank again to all who respond . i 'd welcome more example if anyone know of any . jame kirchner jpkirchner @ aol . com
