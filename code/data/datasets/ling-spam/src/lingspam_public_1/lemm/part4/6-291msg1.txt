Subject: software for an experimental mt system

hi subscriber of linguist list , information and software of the experimental mt system of the project kit-fast from the technical university of berlin be now available vium www and ftp . the information below be available vium www : http : / / www . c . tu-berlin . de / ~ ww / mtsystem . html this www document contain all hypertext link , which be relevant in order to get the software , documentation and further information . the experimental mt system be implement in prolog and run on at compatible pc as well as sun workstation ( see below ) . the experimental mt system of the project kit-fast = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = an experimental mt system have be develop and implement by the project fast within the project group kit . the transfer-base experimental mt system translate german text into english sentence by sentence . the translation of a sentence consist of morphological , syntactical , semantical and conceptual analysis , transfer , generation and morphological synthesis . the semantic and conceptual analysis , the transfer as well as the generation be realize by one algorithm on the basis of term-rewrit ( know from the automatic provement of equation ) . a module for the evaluation of anaphoric relation of the source language and the kl-one base knowledge representation system back be component of the mt system . the back system be use for the representation of background knowledge in its tbox and of the text content in its abox . the evaluation algorithm use the representation of the text content in order to check the semantic consistency of possible antecedent for anaphoric pronoun . this factor and other be define as parameter for the evaluation algorithm . the component of the mt system + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + o morphological analyser base on the sutra system o gpsg parser for direct interpretation of id rule , lp statement and metarule o term-rewrite rule interpreter for semantic and conceptual analysis , transfer and generation o morphological synthesizer base on the sutra system o module for the evaluation of anaphoric relation o the knowledge representation system back o tool for the development of lexicon , grammar and term-rewrite system linguistic data + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + linguistic datum be develop in order to translate a german text , which be " the proposal of the european commission for the esprit programme " . about 100 sentence be successfully test with the help of the mt system . the linguistic datum comprise : o a german grammar ( gpsg ) : - 22 main category , 34 feature - 22 alias - 76 id rule - 23 lp statement - 5 metarule - 23 fcrs - 265 lexical entry ( stem form ) o 134 term-rewrite rule for semantic analysis ( german ) o 37 term-rewrite rule for conceptual analysis ( german ) o 248 term-rewrite rule for transfer ( german - - ) english ) o 182 term-rewrite rule for generation ( english ) o 8 factor for the evaluation of anaphoric relation in german : 1 . agreement 2 . bind 3 . proximity 4 . preference for the semantic subject 5 . topic preference 6 . identity of role 7 . negative preference for free adjunct 8 . conceptual consistency o the predefine background knowledge comprise selectional restriction implementation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + the mt system be implement in quintus - prolog 3 . 1 ( commercial software ) and swi - prolog 1 . 9 . 5 ( public domain software ) . both prolog dialect be run on sun workstation under sunos and at compatible pcs under dos ( window 3 . 1 ) . the mt system be test for quintus - and swi - prolog under sunos and under swi - prolog under window 3 . 1 and need about 10 mb of hard disk space . in order to get the software for the mt system run on at compatible pcs under dos ( window 3 . 1 ) see http : / / www . c . tu-berlin . de / ~ ww / mtdo . html . if you be interest in receive the software for the mt system for sun workstation under sunos see http : / / www . c . tu-berlin . de / ~ ww / mtsun . html . document relate to the mt system + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + o birte schmitz , susanne preu _ , christa hauenschild " textreprdsentation und hintergrundwissen f | r die anaphernresolution im maschinellen \ bersetzungssystem kit-fast " kit -
