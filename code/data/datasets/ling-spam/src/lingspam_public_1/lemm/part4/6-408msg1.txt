" for info on truetex email richard j . kinch ( kinch @ netcom . com ) ; for info on y&y tex email loui vosloo ( 71172 . 524 @ compuserve . com ) . both be in the $ 400 - - 500 area from memory . seem to me that y&y tex be a bite more abreast of change ( like latex 2e ) than truetex but you 'd be best to get info from both of course to make up your own mind . " 4 ) latex on the mac - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - " if you be not set on an intel - base processor , oztex 1 . 8 be the best shareware version for the mac , while texture ( from blue sky ) be a highly regard commercial implementation . " " i ' ve use texture for year on a mac and still have n't see anything to compare in term of ease of integration of graphic . " 5 ) emtex - - - - - - - - - emtex seem to be the overall favorite for dos machine . it be say to be much more widely use ( than gtex ) and easier to install . a summary of how you can get it : " the most painless way to get latex on your pc be to download emtex from the university of georgium ( aus . uga . edu , / pub / emtex ) . we give additional installation instruction beside those provide by the author . " other cite : ftp . rus . uni-stuttgart . de / pub / tex / sytem / msdo / emtex and emtex-font ponder . cscus . unt . edu [ 129 . 120 . 3 . 16 ] pub / tex / emtex ymir . claremont . edu [ 134 . 173 . 4 . 23 ] [ anonymous . tex . ibm _ pc . emtex ] there be also a particular enthusiastic endorsment of emtex for emac user on os / 2 : " i use the os / 2 version [ of emtex ] which be truly excellent ( not be limit by memory , it be much better than the dos version ) . there be also available for os / 2 , a graphical dvus viewer ( dvipm ) , ghostscript , dvip , etc . in addition , em have port gnu emac to os / 2 ( the current version be 19 . 27 ) . imho , if you be go to work in latex , you should be use emac in latex mode as your editor . emac + emtex under os / 2 have pretty much supplant other use of word process software " 6 ) gtex - - - - - - - - the gtex package be say to be more complete ( amslatex , amstex , dviwin etc . ) and more window - friendly than emtex . this be , more or less , what sell me on it . i get it from : gtex ftp . shsu . edu / tex-archive / system / msdo / gtex1 . 0 for ms window / dos user . microemac for window be the host interface whose menus allow easy access to tex / metafont / amspell / bibtex / etc . also include be complete macro set for plie tex , latex , nfss , e - tex , amslatex , and amstex . one person who respond to my query comment that gtex be less mature than emtex . i must say that he be probably right . installation take me much longer than i anticipate . here be a summary of the problem and their workaround : 1 ) to begin with , the main tex . exe in the base directory do not accept argument . i may have miss something , but i could not make latex work by the standard $ ) tex &lplain ( file-name > what i get be simply the tex environment . i could , of course , load lplain at this point and then load my file . but this be rather cumbersome . i find a workaround through micro-emac , which be part of the package . 2 ) i do n't realize that if you unzip latex2e after unzip latex , you clobber some of the latex 2 . 09 . sty file ( and you cannot use latex 2 . 09 as a result ) . there be a ( rather complex ) workaround and if you need latex2e only to begin with you be in good shape . however , it turn out that when you run latex2e . bat in the texfmt directory ( to generate the . fmt file for latex2e ) the name of the fmt file be latex . fmt , but it turn out that micro-emac package expect a totally different fmt file for latex2e , namely a file call nfss2ltx . fmt . even change the relevant bat file do not solve the problem . the only workaround i could find be to copy latex . fmt as nfss2ltx . fmt ( in short , if you do n't want the hassle , install latex only ) . 3 ) the dvus package for both preview and print ( write by hipocrate sendouka ) be rather nice . the feature that generate miss font automatically be particularly useful if your disk space be limit . however set this option to work right be difficult and the documentation be not very helpful . if you run under window nt ( as i do ) this be what you need to do : o select option / miss font . . . o select the third option ( append line to file and execute command ) o in the line text box write : call genpk $ f $ m $ x $ y $ x $ y $ d $ p $ e o in the file text box write : x : \ ( temp-dir ) \ < batch-file . bat > where x : be your hard drive , temp-dir be the value of your temp environment variable and batch-file be an arbitrary name for a batch file that will generatte miss font . for example , i use the follow text : c : \ temp \ miss . bat o in the cmd text box write : genallnt . bat $ ( temp ) \ miss . bat where temp be the environment variable that contain the name of the directory in the file text box . note that in the cmd text box you need to use an environment variable ( you have to ) while in the file text box you cannot ( you must specify the literal name of the temp directory ) . it take me a while to figure this out and it be n't fun . if you do it wrong , dvus take control over your entire operate system , fire up and kill dos widow in rapid succession . you cannot even use nt 's task list to kill the runaway process .
