" henry roger ( roger @ epa . utoronto . ca ) write and remark that " [ t ] he distinction between upper and lower case in the roman alphabet obviously develop in the write of the middle age . . .

( and as a final part shoot , so to speak , i would like to point out that in english write we use a capital letter for the 1st . p . s . in all environment , but not for any other person ! why ? was this a print influence too ( e . g . , to distinguish it from small " i " in roman numeral ? ) . ) from talk to a local professor , russian , for instance , ( if i remember correctly ) , do not have this distinction . how about other language write system , european or not ? and what effect do this english pattern have on us psychologically ? in the sense that " i " be more important than " you , them " etc . ? ) . once again , thank-you to all respondent . i look forward to discussion , if any , on my question - - either post to list or to me directly . regard to all , anthea . * * " word do n't mean , people mean . . . . " * * ( have forget the author of this reminder ) . afb .
