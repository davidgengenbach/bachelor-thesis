jack aubert be absolutely correct . the teach of standard english be a thing that i do not hesitate to say should be compulsory nationwide ( although this do n't necessarily mean that it have to be so vium a federal - level mandate . ) i have nothing at all against personal or familial or ethnic bilingualism and i spend a great deal of time and effort to render myself bilingual as a teenager , when the odds be against me . if it be up to me , most people would master a second language in childhood . however , english be an essential ingredient of the glue that bind the u . s . together . it be far more cruel to help non - english speaker in the u . s . to get along without it than it be to require that they learn it ( and to provide the necessary educational infrastructure . ) a substantial majority of formerly-non - english - speak immigrant to the u . s . hold this position , and if they do not feel denigrate by have to learn english , who be the other " expert " that would claim it be degrade ? ( i have n't see anyone express that opinion yet on this list ; have i miss any such post ? ) > national plural mono-lingualism be a curse ! damn straight it be ! ! - - marion kee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - marion kee | i do n't speak for cmu , knowledge engineer , center for machine translation | and cmu returns the favor . carnegie mellon university pittsburgh , pa , usa | all opinion be my own .
