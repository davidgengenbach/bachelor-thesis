( 1 ) john put the book on the table and peter put too . ( 2 ) a . john have put the book on the table and peter have too . b . john must put the book on the table and peter must too . if you know of any relevant fact and / or reference , please respond directly to me . i will post a summary if there be sufficient interest . zeljko boskovic boskovic @ uconnvm . uconn . edu department of linguistic , u-145 university of connecticut storr , ct 06269
