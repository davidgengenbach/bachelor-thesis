Subject: summary : buccalization

several week ago i post a query ask for instance of " buccalization " , the development of a glottal stop into an oral stop . the reason for the query be that i ' m compile a catalogue of lenition and fortition type for a textbook , and this be the only type in my catalogue i could n't find an example of . i receive seven response . none of them turn up an absolutely ironclad example of a glottal stop develop into an oral stop , though the thing that do turn up be nonetheless strike . four language be cite . maru , a tibeto - burman language , have turn syllable-final zero into [ t ] or [ k ] , depend on the precede tone . it be possible , but not certain , that this change proceed vium glottal stop . ( robin burl , 1966 , ` the addition of final stop in the history of maru ' , _ language _ 47 : 581-586 ; anatole lyovin , 1968 , ` note on the addition of final stop in maru ' , _ project on linguistic analysis _ 7 ( berkeley ) . ) mandarin chinese optionally allow syllable-initial zero to be realize as any of several segment , include a glottal stop , a velar nasal , or a velar or uvular voice continuant . ( yuen - ren chao , _ a grammar of spoken chinese _ , p . 20 . ) there be reason to believe that some of these initial zero derive from earlier glottal stop . winnebago have undergo the change [ - r ? ] - > [ - t ? - ] between vowel , and , if i understand the reply correctly , the rhotic itself may be epenthetic in origin . american english have its celebrate case of ` no ' > ` nope ' , possibly vium glottal stop . the same be true of ` yep ' , if this derive directly from ` yeah ' and be not analogical . ( and i have note that i myself sometime have ` welp ' for ` well ' . ) that 's it . it really do look as if the glottal region be a vast sink from which no segment ever returns . it be not obvious why this should be so , since , as one respondent point out , the development of [ ? ] to [ p ] , [ t ] or [ k ] under the influence of neighbor [ u ] , [ i ] or [ a ] do not seem intrinsically implausible , and indeed it be report that early european linguist work in southeast asium sometime mishear and mistranscribe glottal stop in exactly this manner . my thanks to richard coate , lance eccle , jame kirchner , bill mahota , john koontz , david solnit and scott delancey for their response . perhap i should also have inquire about case of [ h ] > oral segment , but i do n't think of it . any further information in this vein will be gratefully receive . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh uk larryt @ cog . susx . ac . uk
