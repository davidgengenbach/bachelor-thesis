griffin bacal internet mail direct inquiry to postmaster @ gbinc . com 8 / 7 / 97 2 : 36 pm british v . american < a > ( summary ) i receive a number of very helpful and insightful reply in response to my question about difference in british & american pronunciation of < a > ( / ae / v . / a / in foreign and loan word such as france , pasta , nicaragua , et al . ) and think it may be nice to pass them on to the list . typically , there 's a nice mix of agreement & disagreement among the response , esp . on the issue of whether american be more " loyal " to the source language than briton be . there be also some observation on british change to native stress pattern ( which i myself notice while dine out with british colleague who order " creme bru - lee " for dessert . . . ) . one question that no one 's answer yet , though : in the british english pronunciation of " jacque chirac " , why do " jacque " have something like / a / when " chirac " have / ae / ? ( the non - french stress on the first syllable of " chirac " have be explain to me already ! ) anyway , here be the response i receive . thank again to all . david weiss david _ weiss @ gbinc . com - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 1 ) i ' ve notice also that the british be more likely to anglicize , in the sense of use english pronunciation , especially of vowel . perhap this habit come from their lengthy use of latin , as a learn language . in the middle age , i believe it be common to adapt latin to the language of the host country . for example , long a in latin be generally say as a post vowel shift / e : / or / ej / in england , as it still be . wherea in north america we generally use the classical pronunciation , with the low vowel . the other instance you cite / fran / v . / fraen / , be a more recent development in british speech , in which / ae / lower to / a : / before certain consonant , although not invariably . for example , in laugh , half , castle , fasten , plant , aunt the lower vowel prevail in standard british english . at least this be what i seem to have notice . how about you ? is it possible that pasta be borrow into british english after the vowel lower take place ? that may explain the lack of lower in this instance . also , the lower do not seem to be entirely phonologically condition , e . g . , ant / aent / v . aunt / a : nt / . " pant " may not be british , but i do n't believe this vowel be lower , either : possibly a new borrow from american english ? dr . ronald cosper ronald . cosper @ stmary . ca - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 2 ) david , just a quick response to your article in the linguist list . i ' m not british or american , but have have a fair amount of exposure to both accent of english . it seem to me that the situation be n't very conclusive . many british speaker believe that they retain the right to ' naturalise ' or ' anglicise ' foreign word name , but then so do american . the problem be that they have do this differently . if we look at more recent french borrowing , the british have generally naturalise them in term of their stress pattern ( therefore : garage , ballet , beret , buffet , massage , to follow the pattern of older borrowing like village , damage ) , wherea american keep it more foreign sound by stress the second syllable . in some case , in the uk , ' garage ' can rhyme with ' carriage ' , and ' buffet ' with ' ( little miss ) muffet ' . on the other hand , older brit still reserve the right to pronounce ' trait ' with the final < t > silent , as in french , unlike american ; and as you mention , there 's ' france ' ( and ' chance ' , 'd ance ' ) . however , if we think of non - european name like irun or pakistan , one stereotype of american pronunciation be eye - ran and pack-i - stan . move on to your / a : / v . / ae / distinction that you mention , i think some of it will have to do with the fact that in american the < a > in < man > be almost universally pronounce / ae / , with perhap the exception of southerner . in the uk , on the other hand , it be / ae / mainly in the south . when you move to northern england , or wale or to scotland , the sound be / a / , i . e . close to the european sound as in german ' mann ' . ( and here , the / a : / in ' path ' or ' car ' be also close to [ a ] . ) you also get this over in northern ireland and the republic . therefore , a southern english speaker would be use to ' naturalise ' an item say use a scot , northern , etc . accent ( thus [ man ] - - > [ maen ] ) , and would therefore apply the same ' rule ' to european name . peter tan elltankw @ nus . sg - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 3 ) hi , i be write back to you off net because i have nothing really substantive to add to your observation , except to say it be n't just name - listen to the british pronunciation of ' lasagna ' or ' pasta ' as well with [ ae ] . but what i want to say be that i name the process " mangle " as a new phonological rule of [ a ] > [ ae ] / [ + foreign ] , or even , more widely , take any foreign word and pronounce it somehow other than the way those foreigner would pronounce it ( you see why i be not reply to the whole net : - ) ) . i notice it in the speech of my father-in - law , from leed , whom i love dearly and who insist on say [ paest @ ] for ' pasta ' . i would never correct him , but i ' ve be aware of it since , and six month of live in britain a couple of year ago only confirm the observation you have note as well . i ' m look forward to see what other , more serious , response look like . margaret e . winter mew1 @ siu . edu - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 4 ) the general rule in british english be to make stress / a / in foreign word into / ae / , as we have in the u . s . in ' piano ' . but ' france ' do n't follow the pattern , because it be anglicize so long ago , and follow another general pattern of south english dialect that be only a couple of century old at most : turn historical short a ( low front / ae / ) into / a : / before ( certain ? ) fricative , with or without a nasal in between . hence ' bath ' , ' castle ' , ' fast ' , ' lance ' , ' last ' , ' france ' , etc . all have / a : / in the south of england . northerner keep the / ae / pronunciation , as do american outside the boston area . the word ' bath ' be a good shibboleth for northerner v . southerner in england . i think i recall read in some history-of - english text that / ae / - - > / a : / be not a cut and dry rule ( or an exceptionless change - - however you want to think of it ) . and i can't recall exactly how the rule be state - - perhap the fricative have to be in a cluster . note that word end in - ash do not undergo the change . and i ' m not sure how the lengthen of / a / before - r and - l relate to this change - - ' arse ' and ' half ' get / a : / and and then lose their liquid , in both north and south england , but not in america outside boston . try pyle and algeo 's history of english if you want to know more about this particular change . - suzanne kemmer kemmer @ ruf . rice . edu - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 5 ) mr . weiss : i ' m not entirely sure that ' non - english < a > ' be the relevant parameter . i ' ve recently return from the southwest , where a number of people pronounce ' colorado ' with < ae > ( a pronunciation some national news announcer report on the recent colorado flood also use ) . as a native of southern new england , i have alway hear this word pronounce systematically and exclusively with < a > , by american , perhap , as you suggest , because of its spanish origin . but my recent experience show that my pronunciation be clearly * not * the only one available . the same variation also occur in the american pronunciation of ' vietnam ' , with some use < a > , as i do , and other use < ae > . ' native ' english word also participate in the same phenomenon : in addition to ' aunt ' , which be a well-known example , there be word such as ' bath ' , ' path ' , and ' laugh ' , which be often pronounce with < a > , not < ae > , in part of new england . for these last four word , my native pronunciation be < ae > , although i find myself sometime use < a > in ' aunt ' , perhap under the influence of ' worcesterese ' . . . george aubin gaubin @ eve . assumption . edu - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 6 ) it seem to me that the sound represent by < a > in most european language lie between the english [ a ] as in father and [ ae ] as in pan . the brit tend to slide it forward when pronounce word such as padre , while the american tend to slide it back ( except for those great lake speaker who have shift / a / toward the center ; they do n't shift it at all ) . in either case they be assimilate the nonexistent phone into their own phonological system . i do n't think either be more ' loyal . ' a similar phenomenon happen with the french round high front vowel in ' tu , ' but with speaker of different language . english speaker , when they do n't get it right , tend to make it a high round back vowel [ u ] . spanish speaker tend to pronounce it as a high unround front vowel [ i ] . the reason why may be relate to subtle shift in location of native vowel , or custom in teach l2 or both . michael newman mn24 @ is6 . nyu . edu - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 7 ) hi david . your query on linguist list about foreign ( a ) pronunciation be pass on to me by mark liberman . as he indicate in his response to you , i have just complete a phd dissertation on this subject . the central phenomenon under study be the one you notice : the difference between american and british treatment of foreign ( a ) . the pattern you observe be indeed the main pattern of divergence between the dialect : american tend to use the / a : / of ' father ' in word like ' pasta ' and ' mazda ' while brit tend to use the / ae / of ' fat ' . the american usage be really akin to use the / o / of ' pot ' , since for most american outside of new england / o / and / a : / be merge ( father and bother rhyme ) . the divergence between the dialect be concentrate predominantly in close ( or potentially close ) syllable . in open ( or potentially open ) syllable , both dialect use / a : / : american and brit alike pronounce ' llama , bravado , nirvana ' , etc . , with / a : / . a very good article by geoff lindsey ( 1990 ) , in a volume edit by s . ramsaran call study in the pronunciation of english , show that the am - br difference extend to other vowel and reflect a basic difference in the organization of am and br vowel system : am vowel contrast along a tense-lax dimension and br along a long-short dimension . charle boberg < cboberg @ unagus . ci . upenn . edu > - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 8 ) i just have a discussion of this with larry trask , an american - bear vasconist work in england ( u . sussex , i think ) . ( cced ; hus , larry . ) base on that discussion , i think i can codify the phenomenon you describe . 1 . the british " nativize " foreign word much more aggressively than the american . a couple of example that be unrelate to the [ a ] / [ ae ] issue : " don juan " sp . [ don ' xwan ] , am . [ dan ' wan ] , but br . [ dan 'd zu &n ] ; " don quixote " sp . [ don kus ' xo te ] , am . [ dan kus ' ho ti ] , but br . [ dan ' kwik sot ] . 2 . as a relatively recent innovation ( 1700 's , i think ) , in the south of england an original [ ae ] be back to [ a ] in some syllable whose coda contain a fricative . hence " grass " , am . and n . eng . [ grae ] , s . eng . [ gra ] ; other example be " past " , " dance " , " entrance " , " chaff " , " rather " . this explain [ fran ] ; it 's not an anomalous attempt to retain a foreign [ a ] , it 's a purely southern english [ a ] , exactly as you would expect from an original [ ae ] . 3 . " pasta " be anomalous . from the above account i would expect s . eng . [ past& ] ; be you tell me they say [ paest& ] ? larry ? 4 . when the syllable in question get farther from the end of the morpheme , thing get murky . for " rascal " , both [ ra kl ] and [ rae kl ] sound plausibly londony to me . but what about " vasconist " ? try as i may , i can't imagine anyone , be he ever so eton - and - oxford , say [ ' va k& nist ] ; i can only hear [ ' vae . . . ] . in the forego , i have blur the distinction between the low-mid [ a ] and the low back english vowel that i think look a little like a " d " in ipa . true oxonian nearly gag every time they say " rather " . allan wechsler awechsle @ bbn . com - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ( 9 ) dear david , nice question : the reason be actually differ vowel system between us and uk . the back / a / of us that you use in word like " milan " do not exist over here : the closest be the vowel you hear in france , which be / a : / ( back ) . this vowel either occur 1 ) as a result of the loss of rhoticity ( car , cart ) , or 2 ) ( in rp and southern english ) before voiceless fricative ( bath ) or cluster start with a nasal , ( dance , france : the similar vowel to the french from be therefore co-incidence ) . in the case of 2 ) this be a change ( 17 / 18th century ? ) from the front / ae / . to pronounce milan with this way would make it sound like it be spell " milarn " . an exception to this be some speaker ' pronunciation of pakistan with 2 / a : / s . i ' m a northerner , so use / ae / in bath , france and the word like pakistan ( and iraq , irun , ( woop , but not in zimbabwe ) : may be many of us use / a : / as these have enter the language since the vowel have be available ? ) regard , maik gibson maik @ azariah . org . uk
