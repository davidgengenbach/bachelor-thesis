Subject: subcategorization in tranformational grammar

dear colleague , i ' m wonder if someone could give me some pointer to the latest literature in transformational grammar ( gb , p&p , minimalism ) that deal with issue of subcategorization . in particular i would like to get a sense of the latest think , include way in which minimalism depart from previous assumption . among the question that i would ideally like to see address be the follow : - what kind of subcategorization relation have be assume in the recent literature , and for what kind of phenomenon ? for instance , a transitive verb must somehow encode the requirement of take a dp complement . but can a verb also take a pp complement accord to the identity of that pp 's head ( as in _ rely _ + _ on _ ) ? - how be subcategorization relation constrain ? that be , what syntactic ( or semantic ) property be think to be accessible ( in the limit ) to the select head ? - if there be substantive formal constraint on subcategorization , where do they come from ? is there anything in the architecture of the theory from which such constraint would follow ? thank very much , - - andrea kathol
