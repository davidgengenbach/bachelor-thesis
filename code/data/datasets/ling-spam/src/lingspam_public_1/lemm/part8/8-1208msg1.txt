" e l ' enver " means " backward " and if you pronounce l ' enver with its syllable reverse you get " verlan . " this be definitely an example of what you describe as type b - - adolescent exclusivist . i have hear it say that verlan originally be use by thief and pickpocket , but suspect this be just a made-up explanation with no particular basis in fact . but whatever its origin , it be now use by adolescent as an exclusivist slang . i do n't think any body actually use verlan for full sentence or extend conversation . it mostly form the basis for individual slang word that go into normal sentance . you could refer to your zon-maus ( maison ) or zon-blou ( blou son ) . there be a movie a few year ago call " le ripoux " which be verlan for " le pourri " which in context refer to corrupt cop . i think the term for french - bear arab , " beur " be form use some version of verlan which be not alway regular . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jack hall : in my response to the query about pig latin , i mention what i call the " op " language , which i read about in a book or magazine when i be about 10-12 year old ( mid 1950 's ) . as i recall , the simple rule be : put " op " ( phonetically [ a : p ] after every consonant in a word except the last ( final ) consonant . i be not certain what the rule be about consonant cluster . thus " dog " would be " dopog " . i remember specifically that the word " umbrella " be give as : " umopbopropellopa " , indicate that " op " be to be place after all three consonant at the begin ( umbr - - ) , but only one after the double " l " . i have never meet anybody who have hear of this language , or know how to use it , and , since i learn about it from a book , rather than from other people ( child ) , i cannot say anything about the sociolinguistic of it . for me it be an idiolect ( ! ! ) we ' re talk at least 40 year here , but the strange thing be , i can actually visualize the item that i read , and the page on which it be print , although i certainly do n't know the title of the book . i be sure that it be write for people my ( our ) age at the time , not for adult . i remember that , even while i be read it , and although i be only about 10 year old , i be aware that the description of the " language " be not sufficiently detail in treatment of matter such as consonant cluster or sequence . i ' m pretty sure that " st " would be treat as a cluster , with one " op " insert after it , not an " op " after the " s " and another " op " insert after the " t " . thus " stay " would be " stopay " , not " soptopay " , but i remember that at the time i be aware that i be not sure how such a word would be treat . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - nobuko koyama - murakamus : japanese ba-bus - bu-be - bo language ( or lingo ) be use by teenager . ba - bi-bu - be-bo language be specifically use when they . . . . . . . be tease or joke with other , wish to make their conversation sound so secretive , and purposely annoy other . manipulate this language so skillfully be a key to the membership of this group . if you mimic this language poorly , you would be automatically exclude from the group . one more thing : there be some variant in use of this language . difference seem to be strongly relate with type of dialect ( of japanese ) they speak . in the northern part of the mainland japan , ba-bus - bu-be - bo be insert accordingly base on phonetics . in the tokyo metropolitan area , ba-bus - bu-be - bo be insert between orthographic letter ( at least such be a tendency that i have find ) . e . g . , " icecream " ( write as a-us - su-ku - rus - : - mu ) nb " : " represent lengthen mark in japanese orthography here . 1 ) a-ba - i-bus - su-bu - ku-bu - ri-bus - i-bus - mu-bu ( tokyo ) 2 ) a-ba - i-bus - su-bu - ku-bu - ri-bus - i-mu - bu as far as i know , the age group that i mention ( those be teenager in 80 's ) be in the rage of 15-18 ( which means that they be in high school at that time period : nb in japan , unlike u . s . , high school be legally and clearly a separate institute ) . we all encounter and experience this ba-bus - bu-be - bo language when we be high school student . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mark wilson : it 's be several year since i observe the phenomenon i tell markel about ( the german insertion of " lav " after vowel ) . german : " lav " insert after vowel . " ilavich wohlavonelave ilavin balavad holavombulavurg " for " ich wohne in bad homburg " to be more precise , the insertion be " lavv " , where v stand for the vowel immediately precede the ( insert ) " l " . = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3d = 3 some tentative conclusion : ( a ) both phenomenon , pig latin - type phonologically manipulate secret language , and youth slang , be apparently neither an anglosaxon , nor a european particularity . ( b ) predeliction to pig latin - type language game cover a much wider age bracket than i have initially suspect , begin at around 10 year , and overlap with youth slang , in which pig latin - type expression may be take up as slang - specific word . thank again to everybody who contribute . perhap i should apologize that this summary get so long , but to be honest , of course , i be very happy to have get so much to summarize , and think it would be selfish not to share it with fellow linguist - lister and future searcher of the linguist archive . for this same reason , here be my own experience with pig latin : at age 12-13 year , in indonesian junior middle school ( smp ) in bogor , west java , i encounter ( take part ) in the follow form of pig latin : sentence be construct to preferentially consist of bisyllabic word ( most basic word in indonesian be bisyllabic ) , and when the first syllable end in a consonant , the entire second syllable be replace by _ se _ ( _ e _ as in english " be " ) , otherwise the initial consonant of the second syllable be retain and only the rest replace : _ saya cinta sama kamu _ " i love you " ( _ c _ as engl . _ ch _ ) become : _ sayse cinse samse kamse _ from other people i know that similar indonesian pig latin have exist in other part of indonesium , particularly in central and east java . most of the one i hear of have the _ se _ insertion , but the rule be not alway exactly like in bogor in my childhood . it be only use occasionally , particularly to tease those who be not " in " to the secret . it be a pass fad which last not even as long as one school year . finally , i understand that some time around 10 year ago , in israelian pop-music there have be a hit , which also become popular outside israel , particularly in west europe . the title seem to have mean " i love you " in pig latin - style manipulate hebrew . can anyone tell me anything of that song , but particularly of the hebrew pig latin ? doe anyone know anything about pig latin e . g . in chinese , hindus , tamil , arabic , turkish , or suahelus ? doe youth slang exist in amerindian language , in australian aborigine , or other language of pre-industrial community ? best regards to all , waruno - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - waruno mahdus tel : + 49 30 8413-5301 faradayweg 4 - 6 fax : + 49 30 8413-3155 14195 berlin email : mahdus @ fhi-berlin . mpg . de germany www : http : / / w3 . rz-berlin . mpg . de / ~ wm / - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
