Subject: nonreferential np 's in english

in a number of lg ( roviana and yup ' ik eskimo be the two in which i have encounter this ) , nonreferential np 's be phonologically and / or morphologically / syntactically incorporate into the vrb / verb phrase / verb group . are there any similar structural clue which could be use to identify nonreferential np 's in english ? my interest be in identify nonreferential np 's in write english so that a computer natural lg process system would know not to set up referent for them to serve as antecedent for subsequent anaphora resolution . compound ( e . g . duck-shoot season ) can i suppose be treat superficially as single word , but what about thing like ' lose faith in ' , ' catch sight of ' . of course , some criterion will involve larger discourse issue , but it may be that it be possible to identify at least some nonreferential np 's " cheaply " , i . e . just by look within a clause and / or consider inherent lexical semantics . i will summarize and post any reply to this list . regard , simon corston .
