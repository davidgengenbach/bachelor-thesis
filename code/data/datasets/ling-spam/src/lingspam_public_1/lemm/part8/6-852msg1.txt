the follow new technical report be now available from the institute for research in cognitive science : probabilistic match of brain image j . c . gee l . lebriquer c . barillot d . r . haynor ircs-95 - 7 $ 2 . 20 image match have emerge as an important area of investigation in medical image analysis . in particular , much attention have be focus on the atlas problem , in which a template represent the structural anatomy of the human brain be deform to match anatomic brain image from a give individual . the problem be make difficult because there be important difference in both the gross and local morphology of the brain among normal individual . we have formulate the image match problem under a bayesian framework . the bayesian methodology facilitate a principle approach to the development of a match model . of special interest be its capacity to deal with uncertainty in the estimate , a potentially important but generally ignore aspect of the solution . in the construction of a reference system for the human brain , the bayesian approach be well suit to the task of model variation in morphology . statistical information about morphological variability , accumulate over past sample , can be formally introduce into the problem formulation to guide the match or normalization of future datum set . bayesian approach to the brain image match problem j . c . gee l . lebriquer c . barillot d . r . haynor r . bajcsy ircs-95 -

a wide coverage grammar for english christy doran danium egedus beth ann hockey b . sriniva martin zaidel ircs-95 - 09 $ 1 . 3 this paper present the xtag system , a grammar development tool base on the tree adjoin grammar ( tag ) formalism that include a wide-coverage syntactic grammar for english . the various component of the system be discuss and preliminary evaluation result from the parse of various corpus be give . result from the comparison of xtag against the ibm statistical parser and the alvey natural language tool parser be also give . disambiguation of super part of speech ( or supertag ) : almost parse aravind k . joshus b . sriniva ircs-95 - 10 $ 1 . 28 in a lexicalize grammar formalism such as lexicalize tree - adjoin grammar ( ltag ) , each lexical item be associate with at least one elementary structure ( supertag ) that localize syntactic and semantic dependency . thus a parser for a lexicalize grammar must search a large set of supertag to choose the right one to combine for the parse of the sentence . we present technique for disambiguate supertag use local information such as lexical preference and local lexical dependency . the similarity between ltag and dependency grammar be exploit in the dependency model of supertag disambiguation . the performance result for various model of supertag disambiguation such as unigram , trigram and dependency-base model be present . a freely available syntactic lexicon for english danium egedus patrick martin ircs-95 - 11 $ 1 . 18 this paper present a syntactic lexicon for english that be originally derive from the oxford advance learner 's dictionary and the oxford dictionary of current idiomatic english , and then modify and augment by hand . there be more than 37 , 0 syntactic entry from all 8 part of speech . an x - window base tool be available for maintain the lexicon and perform search . c and lisp hook be also available so that the lexicon can be easily utilize by parser and other program . lexicalization and grammar development b . sriniva danium egedus christy doran tilman becker ircs-95 - 12 $ 1 . 18 in this paper we present a fully lexicalize grammar formalism as a particularly attractive framework for the specification of natural language grammar . we discuss in detail feature - base , lexicalize tree adjoin grammar ( fb-ltag s ) , a representative of the class of lexicalize grammar . we illustrate the advantage of lexicalize grammar in various context of natural language process , rang from wide-coverage grammar development to parse and machine translation . we also present a method for compact and efficient representation of lexicalize tree . a process model for free word order language owen rambow aravind k . joshus ircs-95 - 13 $ 2 . 0 like many verb-final language , german display considerable word-order freedom : there be no syntactic constraint on the order of the nominal argument of a verb , as long as the verb remains in final position . this effect be refer to as ` ` scramble ' ' , and be interpret in transformational framework as leftward movement of the argument . furthermore , argument from an embed clause may move out of their clause ; this effect be refer to as ` ` long-distance scramble ' ' . while scramble have recently receive considerable attention in the syntactic literature , the status of long-distance scramble have only rarely be address . the reason for this be the problematic status of the datum : not only be long-distance scramble highly dependent on pragmatic context , it also be strongly subject to degradation due to process constraint . as in the case of center-embed , it be not immediately clear whether to assume that observe unacceptability of highly complex sentence be due to grammatical restriction , or whether we should assume that the competence grammar do not place any restriction on scramble ( and that , therefore , all such sentence be in fact grammatical ) , and the unacceptability of some ( or most ) of the grammatically possible word order be due to process limitation . in this paper , we will argue for the second view by present a process model for german . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * how to access report : the report be available in bind form for the price list above , or may be obtain for free , electronically . to obtain a compress postscript copy of the report , open an anonymous ftp session on ftp . ci . upenn . edu path : pub / irc / technical-report the file be name accord to their number . for example , report 95-01 be store as 95-01 . p . z , 95-02 be store as 95-02 . p . z , etc . if you be use ftp , change the set to binary and download the file . to get a copy of report 95-01 , you would type : binary get 95-01 . p . z you can also obtain file through electronic mail . send a mail message to ircsserv @ ftp . ci . upenn . edu . the message should read " send technical-report filename " . you will receive the compress postscript file in reply . request for bind copy should be send to the address list below , and include a check for the price of the desire report . check should be make payable to " trustee of the university of pennsylvanium .
