Subject: q : " english only "

content - length : 1562 my recent query on wwi era suppression of german in iowa have bring up another issue . many in the linguistics field commonly use a term " english only " by which they mean a movement whose member ( many of whom be non-native english speaker ) refer to themselve as the " official english movement " . to me the term " english only " , possibly intentionally , imply a total ban on the use of any other language . the only propose " official english " amendment i ' ve see be the one propose by the organization u . s . english . it state very clearly that it be not to be construe as restrict the use of language other than english in private life , daily business affair , or in situation in which the speaker 's safety be at stake . i ' ve also see poll , particularly from californium , that claim that anywhere from 60 % to 85 % of various immigrant group , that would be affect by such an amendment , actually favor one , in direct opposition to activist group claim to represent them . i can't imagine people favor an " english only " amendment that would place a total ban on use of their native language . leave aside the blanket idea that " life be politics , " can anyone tell me of a recent case ( say , in the last 30 year ) in which a law that would completely ban use of language other than english have come up for a vote somewhere in the u . s . ? i do n't think it 's impossible . i 'd just like to see one , if there have be any . jame kirchner
