Subject: query : chomsky 's " single mutation "

on page 43 of his 1977 paper ` language origin theory ' , in duane rumbaugh 's book _ language learn by a chimpanzee _ , gordon hewe assert that chomsky have explicitly attribute the human language faculty to a single genetic mutation in our ancestor . he give as his source " chomsky ( 1967 ) " , but , exasperatingly , neither this work nor any other work by chomsky be list in his bibliography , nor be it obvious what work he may have be cite . can anyone point me to any place in chomsky 's writings ( or , indeed , in anyone else 's writings ) in which such a suggestion be explicitly make ? all i ' ve be able to find be chomsky 's repeat suggestion that our language faculty may have arise as a by-product of other development and hence as something not subject to natural selection , but that 's not quite the same thing . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cog . susx . ac . uk
