Subject: date format

hello , this be a query about the different way in which date can be express in different language , and whether there be constraint that apply in relation to register ( eg formal , informal , etc ) , genre ( magazine , newspaper , personal v business letter , etc ) , historical , instrumental ( format of calendar ) , nationality , etc . my initial impression be the follow . as far the english speak world go , in britain there be a variety of way in which date can be express in write , include day month year ; day-ordinal month year ; month day , year ; month day-ordinal , year . interestingly , this variety be not find in numerical form , in which ` day / month / year ' be expect . note that the separator vary , the most common be the slash ( / ) , other be the dash ( - ) , the period ( . ) and the blank space ( ) . in the other format in which word be use , only the ` month ' slot can be spell out , with day and year be express in number . variation include the use of ` the ' precede ordinal day number . sometime one can find different format be use in different part of the same publication , eg the header and the report in a newspaper . this seem to be in contrast with the usa where ` month day , year ' seem to predominate whatever the situation , even when express numerically as in 1 / 7 / 95 which be normally read by american as the seventh day of the month of january , wherea the british would take it to mean the first day of the month of july , which be a 6 - month difference . apparently , the american be the only one to adopt month / day / year . someone once tell me this be an old format which come into be as a result of the fact that , in look for today 's date , one would look in a calendar first of all for the current month , with the year be take for grant . any idea ? what 's the norm in other language / dialect , etc ? thank in advance , tony - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - tony berber sardinha | tony1 @ liverpool . ac . uk aelsu | fax 44-51 - 794-2739 university of liverpool | po box 147 | http : / / www . liv . ac . uk / liverpool l69 3bx | ~ tony1 / homepage . html uk | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
