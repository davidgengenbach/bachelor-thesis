Subject: genderless ?

content - length : 350 in some language which be standarly describe as genderless it be still the case , i be pretty sure , that people say thing like ' that woman ' instead of 's he ' and because this look like a purely lexical matter , the appearance of genderlessness be preserve . i wonder if this apply to the language recently describe as genderless on this list .
