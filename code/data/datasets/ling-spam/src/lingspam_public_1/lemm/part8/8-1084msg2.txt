Subject: expletive neg0 and opacity effect

dear all , in the absence of n-word , italian mark sentential negation by ` non ' alone . opacity effect be create by ` non ' in the sense that a wh-operator cannot be extract from a position below neg0 to , say , a higher speccp position . this effect be attribute within relativize minimality to the necessarily co-occure non-overt operator in specnegp . the operator count as a closer potential a ' - antecedent and prevent the move wh-constituent from properly govern its trace . so far , so good . in french , ` ne ' ( = neg0 ) be not usually able to mark sentential negation on its own . in some context , however , it can , e . g . , with pseudo-modal verb such as ` oser ' , ` pouvoir ' . interestingly , in such context , the same opacity effect be also produce , suggest the presence of a non-overt operator in specnegp . so far , still so good . french ` ne ' also have expletive use . for example , in the complement of adversative predicate and comparative , ` ne ' can appear in formal style without reverse polarity . in such context , opacity effect be not attest , suggest that no non-overt operator occupy specnegp . what i 'd like to know be what the situation be in other language , e . g . , spanish , catalan , and relevant non - romance variety too . i think i ' m right in say that , in these variety in which the neg0 be normally sufficient to mark sentential negation alone , the neg0 morpheme ( e . g . , no ) also have expletive use . the question be this : do expletive neg0 produce opacity effect in these language or not ? relevant information about specific language would be welcome , as would reference to discussion in the literature . many thanks . paul dr paul rowlett head of french department of modern language university of salford salford m5 4wt greater manchester unite kingdom
