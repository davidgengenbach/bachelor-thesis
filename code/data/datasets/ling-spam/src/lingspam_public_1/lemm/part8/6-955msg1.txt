Subject: english only ?

english only ? this be a reaction to the message by jack aubert . i can understand what you mean but i be not so sure whether you compare thing with each other that actually should / can be compare . > however , this be not what " bi-lingualism " > really means in the u . s . it means make it easier for non - english speaker > to get through life without have to learn to speak english in the u . s . , the ( mistake ) idea that english be the national language make its easier for the people to take it for grant that one can very well get through life without have to learn any other language . since language learn also entail get to know a different culture , most people miss the opportunity to learn about other way of live , eat , etc . > national plural mono-lingualism be a curse ! for everything you say about this , you do not mention one single argument that it should be english that can be the national language and not spanish . what would you say about this if the number of citizen speak spanish fluently outnumber the amount of people who speak english fluently ? after all , the u . s . just tops off a continent where the great majority speak spanish . why should they speak english at all , in that country to the north of latin - america ? > history have not saddle us with this curse , as it have do to > belgium , . . . most " ethnic " conflict ( there be > counter-example like the hutus and tutsis and the two flavor of irish ) > trace back to language . basque and catalan separatism be base on language . > canada may end up break into two state , each with its own disgruntle > linguistic minority . basque and catalan separatism be not base on language . why do we never hear anything about galician separatism on the iberian peninsulum ? galician be a language very different from spanish ( and not so different from portuguese ) . the name of the region be galicium and be part of spain . galician be a language much older than spanish itself : it be use for poetry and by the king in ancient time . still , we do not hear a lot about galician separatism . neither do we hear anything about leonese separatism , aragonese separatism , andalusian separatism , simply because it do not exist . separatism on the peninsula have nothing to do with language . it have everything to do with historic rights of old kingdom . the comparison with belgium may not be such a good one . the northern part of belgium use to be dutch , this be the reason these people speak dutch . in the u . s . , there be no regional division of group of native-speaker as there be in belgium ( and like there be in catalunya and euzkadus too ) . it be much more probable that separatism between dutch - speak belgian and french - speak belgian be encourage , because it be easy to say : o . k . , since the flemish live in the north and the walloon in the south , why do n't we split up the country ( and if they would , what can i hold against it ? ) . in the u . s . , this be not a very likely situation since the spanish - speak citizen live all over the country . there be also a big historical difference : a mexican family live in chicago will never be able to say " jee , we and all our neighbour and all the people in chicago , illinoi , michigan , indiana , etc . , we use to belong to another country , a country where spanishwa the language . this soil where we be bear and which we owe with thousand of " compatriot " use to belong to a spanish - speak country . " and what if canada break up ? as long as they do it in peace . . . . . really , i think you use the wrong argument here . i mean , do i use argument like : look what china have do to tibet : by invade the country they have destroy a very important cultural and religious heritage , the tibetan be force to learn chinese , the tibetan culture will be lose soon . so please allow spanish in the u . s . ? no , i do n't use this argument either because you cannot compare a cat with a bird . > allow ( for example ) native spanish speaker live in the > u . s . to avoid learn english as young as possible and as well as possible > . . . . . . . . . . . . . . etc . allow million and million of people in a modern , industrialize country like the u . s . to avoid learn any other language but their own greatly surprise me . really , from a practical point of view , and try to agree with jack aubert , i would like to conclude with this . ye , of course plural mono-linguism be a problem . but do it make sense to expect that the half of the population of a country that have worse access to good education be go to make the step of learn two language well ? as have be investigate in minority region in europe , it have be prove that people can only learn a language well when they know their own language well . this be the reason the frisian language get reintroduce in the school in frisium again in the seventy . frisium be a region in the north of holland where people speak frisian and dutch . most school in the city have dutch as a main language and frisian as a second language but in the country-side , at least the first three year , mathematics and everything be be teach in frisian and dutch be a second language . there be no separatism in frisium . in fact , the frisian be among the dutch to speak dutch best since a lot of other dutch only speak their local dialect and be ununderstandable for someone who come from another region . since ( child of ) spanish speaker in the u . s . cannot go to a spanish school to learn their mother tongue thoroughly , they will never be able to learn english really well . it seem more realistic to expect that the one who already speak their mother-tongue well and who have , generally speak , better access to better education would learn spanish . let them become bilingual ( and maybe monolingual spanish in the end ? ? ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * jelly julium de jong * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + atw , o . k . i . h . jatstraat 26 * + dept . of general linguistic + 9712 ek groningen * + university of groningen + the netherland * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | e - mail : julium @ let . rug . nl | | http : / / www . let . rug . nl / linguistic / jellydejong . html |
