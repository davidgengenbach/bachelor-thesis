peter tan write : it seem to me that the evidence for ' aggressive ' nativisation / anglicisation in southern british english as oppose to american english be not clear . in my last lengthy message i do not react to this issue . my reaction be that i agree with peter . i do n't know if some of the unclarity have to do with different historical period which differentiate british and american english , or different cultural domain , e . g . , music ( e . g . , italian term like stacatto and the other i mention in the last message ) v . food ( e . g . , pasta - - and more recently a bunch of mexican food , e . g . , taco , tamale , etc etc ) - - or both etc etc . however , reversal of the ' agressive ' southern brit expectation include some of the commonest and widely know food , such as " tomato " and " banana " where undoubtedly the southern brit " back a " pronunciation be closer to the source than the american pronunciation ( lengthen and raise " tomato " as in " day " and " mate " ) and " banana " rhyme in american english with " anna " which have " front a " , not " back a " as in the " continental " european pronunciation of the same name . " tomato " , of course , be perhap the earliest " mexican " food to become a widespread word in english . as for jim fiedelholz 's observation on brit " nicaragyua " , also strike be brit ( and canadian ) " bile " . at least " bile " could be consider conservative if it be model on the french pronunciation with a front labio-velar " w " , as in " figyure " ( for those of you who do n't pronounce it as " figger " ) . - - benjus
