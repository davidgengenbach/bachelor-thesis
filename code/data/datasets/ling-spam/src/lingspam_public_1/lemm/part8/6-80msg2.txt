Subject: latex and macintosh

you ' ve already make up your mind , it seem , but i want to point out that there be four implementation of tex and latex for the macintosh , three shareware and one commercial . beside the very weak ( in my not particularly humble opinion ) wsuipa font , latex allow the use of adobe type 1 and type 3 ( " postscript " ) font , so that you can use the sil ipa font , or those available commercially from adobe ( time roman , stone san serif and stone serif ) or ecological linguistic ( cf . the recent message from lloyd anderson ) . this be true whichever platform you decide to use . rich alderson
