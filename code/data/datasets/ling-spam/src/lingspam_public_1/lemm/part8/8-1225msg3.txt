Subject: resource on afrikaans

a student of mine here in japan wish to examine the evolution of afrikaans and its relationship to dutch / german / english . source material be scarce in local library , and i personally have not much knowledge of the language or literature on it . both diachronic and synchronic study would be of interest - overview and broadly draw material would be preferable to highly technical ( e . g . , syntactic ) analysis . thank you in advance to helpful linguist who can take the time to point us beyond " the development of afrikaans " and " a grammar of afrikaans " and work by botha to further material . reply privately to guy modica < gmodica @ fh . seikeus . ac . jp > .
