Subject: re : 6 . 923 , sum : chomsky on let the theory choose

chomsky 's optimism about " let the theory decide " about unclear case of grammaticality sharply contrast with the view propose by baudrillard ( in _ l ' autre par luus meme _ ) as to the role of theory in force reality and in define us as theory practitioner . i ' m traslate from the spanish version : " the status of theory could only be one of challenge reality . or , rather , the relationship between the two be one of a mutual challenge . for , undoubtedly , also the real be nothing but a challenge to theory - - not an objective state of affair , but a radical frontier for analysis , beyond which nothing obey theory or beyond which theory no longer have anything to say . but also theory be only make to disobey reality , and it constitute its unreachable frontier . irreconciliation between theory and the real : a corollary of the irreconciliation between subject and their own goal . all attempt at reconciliation be deceive and be doom to failure .
