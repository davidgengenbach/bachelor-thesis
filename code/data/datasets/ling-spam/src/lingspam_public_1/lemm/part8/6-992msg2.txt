Subject: english only

i find the remark of johanna rubba in a recent issue ( 6 . 967 ) to be very worthwhile and to the point . i would like to add a couple of point . in the vast majority of immigrant to the unite state , the typical pattern of language acquisition be : the first generation may or may not learn english ; the second generation learn english natively and the parent ' language to vary degree of proficiency ; the third generation learn only english - - and this be without any legislative intervention . there be strong pedagogical and psycholinguistic reason for bilingual education program for school-age immigrant and unassimilate child of immigrant . it be far easier to ` ` learn to read ' ' ( in the general sense , not in the sense of learn to read a particular language ) in one 's native language , and then learn to read the second language , than it be to learn to read ( in the second language ) and to learn the second language at the same time . - stuart luppescu | university of chicago | a foreign language be ` ` a weapon in sl70 @ cicero . spc . uchicago . edu | in the struggle for life .
