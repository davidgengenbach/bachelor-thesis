Subject: apocryphal american structuralist assertion

there be two common , apocryphal assertion identify with american structuralist linguistics , and i be wonder if either of these assertion be actually make by an american structuralist . they be : 1 . language structure vary in infinitely many way . this statement have be associate with boa , but it 's not in the hail intro . this statement have also be associate with martin joo , who supposedly say something along those line attribute this view to boa ( but not necessarily endorse it himself ) . 2 . the distributional method , apply rigorously , would yield a distinct syntactic category for every word in a language . it be possible that z s harri make such an assertion , though i have n't see mention of it in the secondary literature . i be particularly interest in some form of these assertion make by structuralist who believe it themselve ; but if such do not exist , i be interest in attribution of these two belief to structuralist by other . thank , bill croft
