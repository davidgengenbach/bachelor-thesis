" rapidly reconfigurable field-programmable gate array for accelerate fitness evaluation in genetic program " a late-break papers from gp-97 conference . abstract : the dominant component of the computational burden of solve non-trivial problem with evolutionary algorithm be the task of measure the fitness of each individual in each generation of the evolve population . the advent of rapidly reconfigurable field-programmable gate array ( fpgas ) and the idea of evolvable hardware open the possiblity of embody each individual of the evolve population into hardware for the purpose of accelerate the time-consume fitness evaluation task this paper demonstrate how the massive parallelism of the rapidly reconfigurable xilinx xc6216 fpga can be exploit to accelerate the computationally burdensome fitness evaluation task of genetic program . the work be do on virtual compute corporation 's low-cost hots expansion board for pc type computer . a 16 - step 7 - sorter be evolve that have two fewer step than the sort network describe in the 1962 o'connor and nelson patent on sort network and that have the same number of step as the minimal 7 - sorter that be devise by floyd and knuth subsequent to the patent . john r . koza forrest h bennett iii jeffrey l . hutching stephen l . bade martin a . keane david andre publish in koza , john r .
