Subject: question on a word - reply

many thanks for the reply ! in particular , i ' ll pass on the reference suggestion . i should probably be slightly more specific about what we ' re look for : a word ( again , my friend write the dissertation believe one exist ) that would fit in the sentence : " word x have / be [ xxxx ] with the normal usage of word y . " or else : " these people have [ xxxx ] the meaning of word x and word y . " that be , we ' re not look for example of x and y , or for a description of the general phenomenon of x change mean or have a special ( argot or jargon ) mean , but we want to know if there be a term [ xxxx ] which would accurately indicate that x and y be be use synonymously when they be not normally synonym . . . the specific x and y in question here be " marriage " and " home " ( yes , i do realize that " marriage " and " home " overlap a lot in their usage anyway ; i ' m not familiar enough with my friend 's topic to know exactly what she 's argue , but i believe it involve a particular couple 's development of an individual and idiosyncratic concept of marriage , which at time become , um , blend ? with their concept of home to the extent that they will use either word to refer to it . . . something like that . regardless , you can tell from my attempt to state the question why a word be need . . . : - ) reply by email please ( i ' m not a regular reader of these list ) . and thanks again . jonathan gilbert jong @ dragonsy . com > > > peter t . daniel < grammatim @ worldnet . att . net > 7 / 29 / 97 6 : 45pm > > > an example would help , but it sound like you ' re talk about jargon , slang , or argot ( idiosyncratic language variety define accord to the user group ; see textbook of sociolinguistic ) . > > > deborah d k ruuskanen < druuskan @ cc . helsinkus . fus > 7 / 30 / 97 12 : 00am > > > word use in separate context change mean ? i should imagine there be quite a lot , particular if you think of american / british difference .
