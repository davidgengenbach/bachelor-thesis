Subject: anglicization of composer ' name

judge from the return post , i must have sound like some kind of self-proclaim expert on composer ' name . let me hasten to say that i ' m not . all the pronunciation i put in that little list come as surprise to me . in all case but one , they be give to me by native speaker of the composer ' language , while i be visit the composer ' native country . i do n't speak any of those language and certainly do not claim any expertise . i ' ve just be trust " competent native speaker " . the one exception , by the way , be when karl haa , on one of his daily " adventure in good music " broadcast , assert that pachelbel should be pronounce pach - el - bel . base on karl 's provenance i be incline to trust him . but perhap i ' ve go overboard take native ' pronunciation as gospel . after all , we american certainly manage to mangle enough of our own word , do n't we ? sorry for any consternation i may have cause . i ' ve certainly get an education from this . cheer , gordon brown
