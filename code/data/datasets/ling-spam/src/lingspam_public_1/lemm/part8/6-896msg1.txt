Subject: pragmatic check and anaphor resolution

in an article by marslen - wilson , levy , and tyler ( 1982 ) " produce interpretable discourse : the establishment and maintenance of reference " they discuss the role of inference or " pragmatic check " in the process of anaphor resolution . briefly , anaphoric resolution result from check the information predicate of the anaphor with the local or precede discourse and thereby infer the intend referent . could anyone steer me in the direction of other research which pursue a similar line of argument ? thank you very much . - richard cameron
