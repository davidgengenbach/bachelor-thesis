in a recent post , sxren harder ( sharder @ ling . hum . aau . dk ) bring up an interest point ( quote from steinberg ( 1993 ) " an introduction to psycholinguistic " ) : > the law reflect the widespread belief that the german language be the > embodiment of all that be evil in german culture and that to teach such > a language to young american would be immoral and corrupt . > . . . lawyer for the state of nebraska take essentially the position > . . . [ that ] a language by its very nature represent the spirit and > national character of a people . if this be true , then by teach them > the grammar , structure and vocabulary of the german language , meyer could > indeed have be harm american child by make them into german > militarist right there on the plain of nebraska . - interest , because in several recent posting against the english - only movement , an argument be give that teach foreign _ language _ be good because it expose student to other _ culture _ . that be precisely the reason the teach of the german language be ban , accord to the above quote . i think most of us would agree that the state of nebraska be wrong ; teach another language do not serve to any great extent to pass on the culture . but if you believe that , be n't you be hypocritical to believe that teach foreign language be good because it expose student to other culture ? fwiw , i have a personal opinion : if you want to expose student to other culture , it would be much better to teach ethnography than language . ( better yet , send the student to non-tourist area of other country . but i doubt whether the us educational system be prepare for that ! )
