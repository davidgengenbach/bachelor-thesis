Subject: summary : polish phonology

not too long ago i post a request for polish informant who be also linguist in the hope of get some quick response to some question about polish phonology which be not fully address in the literature . the response have be tremendous . since the detail may not be of interest , and since i be not sure if all respondent want their name use , i will summarize as follow : most respondent report have a contrast between the sequence [ k ' e ] and [ kje ] as well as [ g ' e ] and [ gje ] , where by [ k ' ] and [ g ' ] i mean a front velar probably not quite as front as ipa [ c ] , though . a minority of respondent report no contrast , which be apparently the result of a very recent and presumably spread sound change . of those speaker who do have the contrast , most report also have a similar contrast between [ x ' e ] and [ xje ] sequence , although one or two do not . it be this last contrast , [ x ' e ] v . [ xje ] ( both distinct also from [ xe ] ) which be of special interest because in attest form it only appear before one suffix , a rather peculiar one at that . the suffix be spell - ewicz and it form last name such as stankiewicz or banachiewicz . it be also clear that such name come from eastern poland , and that the [ x ' e ] pronunciation be thus a borrow into standard polish from some eastern dialect and ultimately from east slavic ( belorussian / ukrainian ) . synchronically , however , it be a genuine contrast and one of special interest to those phonologist who be interest in the universal govern the possible system of contrast ( e . g . , in lexical phonology 's structure preservation , ) . great thanks to everybody who have respond so far . once i verify whether i be authorize to publicize people 's name i will post a " nonymous " acknowledgement . any additional information on this topic would be welcome . alexis mr
