multimodal retrieval techniques combined create queries suitable image , video audio retrieval ? general , question is create realistic queries realistic systems . third focus workshop is evaluation techniques multimedia retrieval . currently , most researchers are using standard evaluation measures defined text documents ; need extended / modified multimedia documents . is high degree subjectivity involved needs addressed . focus following specific topics : - content analysis retrieval various media ( text , images , video , audio ) - interaction modalities ( e . g . text , images ) indexing , retrieval - effective user interfaces ( permitting query refinement etc . ) - evaluation methodologies multimedia information . found researchers pay insufficient attention . - techniques relevance ranking - multimodal query formation / decomposition - logic formalisms multimodal queries - indexing retrieval scanned documents - e . g extracting text images , word spotting - retrieval technique both handwritten printed documents . - testbeds evaluating multimodal retrieval : nice resource sharing here since annotating , coming query set are difficult participation : two types participation are expected . those interested making presentation workshop submit full papers either online postscript version hardcopy regular mail address given below . papers exceed 5 , 000 words , including figures , tables , references . those interested participating , presenting papers , submit statement interest , exceed 500 words . clearly state aspect ( s ) workshop reflect research interest . used select panelists . both types submissions are due friday , june 5th . decisions made later friday , june 26th . case paper submission , final camera-ready papers are due july 24th . working notes made available participants workshop . submissions sent : prof . rohini k . srihari , cedar / suny buffalo ub commons 520 lee entrance , suite 202 amherst , ny 14228 - 2583 rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu organization : workshop chairs ( program chairs ) rohini k . srihari , suny buffalo ( rohini @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) zhongfei zhang , suny buffalo ( zhongfei @ cedar . buffalo . edu ) r . manmatha , university massachussetts ( manmatha @ cs . umass . edu ) s . ravela , university massachussetts ( ravela @ cs . umass . edu ) program committee members : shih - fu chang ( columbia u . , usa ) david harper ( robert gordon university , u . k . ) alex hauptmann ( cmu , usa ) rakesh kumar ( sarnoff , usa ) desai narasimhalu ( isi , singapore ) candace sidner ( lotus , usa ) peter schauble ( eth , switzerland ) timetable : paper statement interest submission : june 5th , 1998 decision : july 19th , 1998 camera - ready paper due : july 24th , 1998 sigir conference : august 24th - 28th , 1998 workshop : august 29th , 1998 further information : further questions directed address above , web page workshop http : / / www . cedar . buffalo . edu / sigir98 / mmtr . html sigir conference main web page http : / / www . cs . mu . oz . au / sigir98 /
