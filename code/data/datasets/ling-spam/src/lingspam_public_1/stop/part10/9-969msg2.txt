objective workshop is examine evaluate techniques adjusting " linguistic impedance mismatch " between real-world input natural language input expected various mt engines . thus workshop focus computational approaches preprocessing system input mt engines andon statistical methods evaluating systems embedded mt component . linguistic preprocessing image data researchers working image data , is currently underway effort augment ocr ( optical character recognition ) engines linguistic data recognize convert bitmap data characters - - - similar has already been done speech recognition linguistic data hmms ( hidden markov models ) . ocr researchers experimented image-level early topic detection using word-shape recognition . principle , provide first-step filtering documents homogeneous mt input set , desirable goal mt evaluation . thus expect individuals working intending incorporate ocr computer systems interested area . linguistic preprocessing online data those working online input , even though characters are already present , often still remains task preprocessing meaningful , symbolic character strings are part text translated . systems , rules identifying encapsulating removing strings need hand-crafted over mt engine limitations surface . others , combination hand-crafted rules statistically trained nl models has worked . many observed html annotations , alphanumeric items , spreadsheet word processing codes are harder weed originally expected . research efforts low-density less-commonly taught languages , common ones , encounter substantial problem variation spelling conventions transcription preferences . those natural languages are primarily spoken written , example , is frequently case . researchers working class problem built variants spell checkers ( sc ) , components standardize words one orthography ( spelling convention ) before submitting mt engine . idea has arisen component is build option adjust level sc correction - - - relevant input after ocr nonetheless varies noisy relatively clean . evaluation embedded mt systems among those working statistical methods evaluating systems embedded mt component , seen two distinct trends . one group statisticians has begun looking appropriate models outside world mt evaluation , examining efforts others distinct metrics components combine overall system-level metric using fuzzy mathematics . another group researchers is looking instead developing one-dimensional scale ranking mt engines along continuum defined system-level function . approach , example , might rank one engine enough filtering documents , while another engine deemed linguistically robust ranked higher generate enough initial translation subsequent post-editing . welcome functional evaluations mt components computer systems embedded mt components . submissions submitters are invited send short paper , 5 pages , addressing one three areas discussed above . papers define problem embedded mt system is focus work , describe embedded mt system design ( simple sketch ) sample input data where relevant , present approach problem . work various stages completion is acceptable ; expect current status work made clear . submission end-to - end output embedded mt system is especially encouraged . papers collected distributed participants theworkshop . ideally , result workshop clearer delineation : ( 1 ) range linguistic preprocessing problems ( 2 ) range designs embedded mt systems ( 3 ) problems aretreated different embedded mt systems ( 4 ) metrics are being used evaluate systems components . dates notice interest participation : july 10 , 1998 ( voss @ arl . mil ) please identify three areas intend address : preprocessing image data , preprocessing online data , evaluation embedded mt systems . position paper submission : august 10 , 1998 notifications : september 10 , 1998 final copies papers : october 10 , 1998 workshop : october 28 , 1998 submissions printed electronic form . submissions sent : clare voss army research laboratory amsrl-is - ci 2800 powder mill road adelphi , md 20783 phone : ( 301 ) 394-5615 fax : ( 301 ) 394-3903 e-mail : voss @ arl . mil registration fee conference is $ 50 . non - presenters accepted first-come , first served basis . strongly encourage participation embedded mt system users , members research development communities . after july 11 , 1998 , copy call , registration form , further update information available via link : < http : / / rpstl . arl . mil / isb / > florence reeder | phone : ( 703 ) 883-7156 mitre corporation | ( 703 ) 883-6750 ( secretary ) ms w640 | fax : ( 703 ) 883-1279 1820 dolley madison blvd . | email : reeder @ azrael . mitre . org mclean , va 22102 |
