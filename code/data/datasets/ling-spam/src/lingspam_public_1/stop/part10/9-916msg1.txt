psycholinguistics , fpse , university geneva , switzerland ( nnguyen @ fapse . unige . ch ) . 1 synopsis 1 . 1 general outline book is concerned multiple sources information are processed speech perception , generally , pattern recognition . is based upon important research programme conducted massaro colleagues over two decades . book focuses perception so-called bimodal speech , addressing wide range issues visual information ( provided speaker 's face ) auditory information are combined each perceptual system . scope book is much larger , however , massaro 's purpose here is describe defend psychological law relevant wide variety domains . contrast already well-established laws same kind ( e . g . weber 's law perception ) , are unidimensional , principle is multidimensional , describes several factors impact behaviour . principle is embodied computational model pattern recognition , fuzzy logical model perception ( flmp ) , whose latest version is presented discussed detail . flmp is systematically contrasted alternative computational models , using broad perceptual database benchmark throughout book . separate part , book deals methods synthesizing talking faces experiments bimodal speech perception , introduces baldi , talking face developed massaro coworkers . book is accompanied cd-rom contains series demonstrations relating many topics dealt . book is divided four main sections . section 1 , " perceiving talking faces " , focuses perception speech ear eye . massaro reviews most significant empirical findings domain , discusses main methodological issues , presents general classification existing computational models bimodal speech perception . central section is idea speech perception obeys general behavioural principle integration between different sources information . section 2 , " broadening domain " , aims assessing principle holds across broad individual situational variability . author demonstrates inter-individual variations bimodal speech is perceived , depending listener 's age native language instance , accounted within flmp framework . using examples taken different perceptual cognitive situations , massaro defends idea flmp adequately describes information processing irrespective situational differences . section 3 , " broadening framework " , opens presentation extended explicit version flmp , designed particular account dynamics speech processing . section includes detailed analysis methodological issues involved assessing quantitative predictions psychology , along discussion critiques expressed investigators flmp over years . finally , section 4 , " creating talking faces " , is specifically dedicated synthesis visual speech . 1 . 2 behavioural principle although many readers already familiar massaro 's fuzzy logical model perception , shall here assume contrary , proceed present brief outline model . central assumption flmp is pattern recognition involves common set processes regardless specific nature patterns . speech is seen being associated dedicated processing module , motor theory speech perception ( liberman , 1996 ) instance . contrary , sensory information is assumed processed same whether our brain is busy recognizing speech sounds , letters , manual gestures , few examples . cases , flmp postulates mapping stimulus unique perceptual category entails going through three main stages processing , feature evaluation stage , feature integration stage , decision stage . evaluation stage consists converting available sources information set properties referred features . each feature is given continuous ( fuzzy truth ) value , represents degree stimulus corresponds each set internal prototypical patterns , along particular perceptual dimension . thus , one important visual feature perception cv syllables is degree opening lips . model therefore assumes internal prototypes available perceptual system specify lips are open onset syllable / da / , closed / ba / , etc . second stage , features are integrated each , determine overall degree match sensory input each prototypes ( e . g . each syllables known receiver ) . third final stage , decision is taken , basis relative goodness match input each prototype . flmp makes number specific assumptions each stage process . first , hypothesizes available sources information are simultaneously brought play pattern recognition . thus , visible speech auditory speech are both assumed influence bimodal speech is perceived . second , different sources information are assumed evaluated independently each . means example visible speech does effect auditory speech is converted set features , two sources information being combined later stage processing . model makes specific assumptions sources information are integrated each ( multiplicative rule ) , decisions are taken ( relative goodness rule ) . major prediction model is " influence one source information is greatest source is neutral ambiguous " ( 19 ) . prediction is best illustrated experiment whose results served database testing models pattern recognition several occasions book ( chapters 2 11 ) . experiment , synthetic auditory stimuli ranging continuum between / ba / / da / were crossed visual stimuli varying between / ba / / da / . bimodal stimuli were presented subjects forced-choice identification task , along each unimodal stimuli . ( expanded factorial design is shown massaro most appropriate experimental design determining two sources information are combined each pattern recognition . ) bimodal stimuli , main results are typically depicted two-factor plot , proportion / da / responses ordinate , levels auditory source information abscissa , different curve each levels visual source information . represented , results clearly show statistical interaction between two sources information . specifically , influence one source information proves larger middle , ambiguous range source . interaction graphically takes shape american football , is reason presented throughout book hallmark fuzzy logical model perception . summary , massaro proposes universal principle perceptual cognitive performance explain pattern recognition . according principle , " are influenced multiple sources information diverse set situations . many cases , sources information are ambiguous particular source alone does usually specify appropriate interpretation . perceiver appears evaluate multiple sources information parallel degree each supports various interpretations , integrate together derive overall support each interpretation , assess support each alternative based alternatives , select most appropriate response . " ( p . 291 ) . 2 critical evaluation 2 . 1 general evaluation book is clearly major contribution study speech perception , generally , cognitive psychology . is admirably clear is written quite elegant manner . doubt book read great interest research scientists many different fields . work is result ambitious intellectual endeavour aimed introducing behavioural law , is placed massaro equal footing weber 's law perception , power law learning . speech scientists are presented extensive series experiments perception bimodal speech . whatever stance domain , quite challenging massaro 's view speech perception constitutes one aspect much general form cognitive processing , namely pattern recognition . computer scientists working field speech technology particularly interested book 's final section synthesis visual speech . regardless background , readers book worth using tutorial experimental methods available investigating speech perception . great variety experimental paradigms tasks are discussed length massaro , extensively discusses methods assessing computational models pattern recognition , particular , fitting models observed results . respect , using results experiment described above reference database was quite initiative view , allows reader easily understand massaro 's point issues are raised , without having again through details experimental design each . book prove invaluable resource teaching . care was taken select prototypical results , set work historical context . number rather fascinating anecdotes historical references are given , going mcgurk 's personal account discovery mcgurk effect , audio-visual rendition introduction george miller 's seminal article ubiquitousness number 7 plus minus 2 , miller 's face texture-mapped onto baldi 's wire-frame head . cd-rom accompanies book enables reader directly experience psychological illusions associated perception bimodal speech , constitutes most useful research teaching tool . negative side , massaro 's / ba / - / da / experiment leading strand throughout obviously results book being focused perception non-sense syllables . although interaction visible speech audible speech word recognition is mentioned number occasions ( e . g . pp 21-23 pp . 181-182 ) , book contains few suggestions perceive isolated words , let alone connected speech . was surprised fact little place was devoted presenting current theories models speech perception . although models trace are mentioned several occasions book , is fair flmp is still given lion 's share . book has minor defects absence list figures , fact cd-rom bands ( 1 . 4 , 1 . 5 1 . 6 ) are referred incorrectly text . list cd-rom selections pointed pages where each band is referred . another domain , been quite interesting perceptual database used book made available cd-rom . although probably required substantial amount additional work , found useful provided interactive version main computational models discussed book ( flmp , race model , single channel model , etc . ) . flmp model downloaded massaro 's laboratory web site santa cruz ( http : / / mambo . ucsc . edu ) , is currently distributed fortran code has modified recompiled each set data , operation is probably reach many students psychology linguistics . 2 . 2 specific comments am familiar areas dealt book , hide fact review is biased towards own interests , namely production perception auditory speech . following comments specifically concentrate two issues relating area research , role features speech processing course speech processing . 2 . 2 . 1 features most useful are extensive comments made massaro status features model ( particular chapter 2 chapter 10 ) . long found difficult determine close features were classical phonetic features . book makes clear is direct relation between former latter . indicated above , flmp postulates are three main stages processing pattern recognition : feature evaluation stage , feature integration stage , decision stage . specific assumptions are made model features are integrated each , decision is taken depending outcome integration . set feature values , therefore , model predict probability occurrence each possible response ( e . g . " ba " " da " ) . however , attention paid fact feature values are derived stimulus . are actually determined posteriori manner , subjects ' observed responses , using algorithm ( stepit ) allows deviation between responses predicted ones minimal . features are seen model * free parameters * , whose values are set basis actual performance subject pattern recognition task , model perform best , . e . maximize goodness fit . according massaro , " [ model is ] * predicting * exact * form * results , * postdicting * actual quantitative * values * overall predictions " ( p . 294 , emphasis ) . words , stimulus is occasion explicitly mapped onto internal features flmp model . respect , features defined flmp markedly different phonetic features . let us example opposition between / ba / / da / , much emphasis is put book . acoustically , / b / / d / are said differ each according feature grave-acute , / b / being classified grave / d / acute . is case flmp features , grave acute viewed target values referring prototypical stops . however , grave-acute feature is explicitly defined acoustical terms ( e . g . slope short-term spectrum release stop , stevens & blumstein , 1978 ) . contrary , exact nature flmp features remains undetermined , values being subject one main constraint is model account subjects ' responses accurately possible . thus , acoustic structure stimulus is directly taken consideration estimation feature values . experiments using audible speech , flmp features lend themselves acoustic interpretation . / ba / - / da / experiment example , prototypes / ba / / da / are assumed include one auditory feature , namely variations frequency second ( f2 ) third ( f3 ) formants onset vowel ( slightly falling f2-f3 / da / , rising f2-f3 / ba / ) . however , interpretation stems fact f2 f3 onset frequencies were precisely acoustic parameters manipulated experimenters synthesize auditory continuum between / ba / / da / . words , acoustic significance flmp features is derived experiment has been designed . model does rely particular system acoustic features ( example stevens & blumstein , 1978 , alternative system ) , system is embodied experimental design , is external model itself . practice , therefore , issue speech sounds are mapped onto features is addressed model . why is is clear . several occasions , massaro suggests determining advance given individual convert given stimulus set feature values is simply our reach . stimulus-to - feature mapping shows variability is said analogous variability weather : are too many previous contributions influences allow quantitative prediction ( 135 ) . fundamental distinction is fact established flmp between intake * information * , . e . stimulus-to - feature mapping , * information processing * , . e . features are combined each mapped response ( cf . p . 135 ) . while flmp predicts information processed same one individual , regardless whether relates speech sounds , facial movements , manual gestures , etc . , is assumed information is extracted stimulus is contrary subject too many sources variations accurately characterized ahead . understanding , means so-called evaluation stage cannot accounted model , least much accuracy . however , least one occasion massaro does suggest limitation is consubstantial every model perception pattern recognition , circumvented . according , one indeed " easily hypothesize functions relating feature values stimulus levels , [ although ] represent * model information * addition one information processing " ( 294 , emphasis ) . suggests building model information is feasible . whether is possibility flmp being completed model kind , . e . explicit stimulus-to - feature mapping stage , is issue remains addressed . 2 . 2 . 2 course speech processing plays quite central role different ways book . first , massaro shows flmp explicitly formalized account dynamics perceptual processing ( chap . 9 ) . formalization is presented reply criticisms expressed number investigators ( e . g . mcclelland , 1991 ) , pointed flmp accurately characterizes asymptotic outcome perceptual system ( e . g . probability particular response occur ) , has little course processing . dynamic version flmp is intended address reactions . version , stimulus-to - feature mapping is assumed certain amount . during interval , information stimulus gradually accumulates , becomes increasingly accurate . is assumed accuracy increases negatively accelerated function processing , information is gleaned early late processing stimulus . one further assumption is " integration separate features [ is ] updated continuously featural information is being evaluated . similarly , decision [ ] occur after stimulus presentation " ( 259 ) . thus , is partial temporal overlap between different stages processing , sense one process begin before previous process is finished ( figure 2 . 1 , p . 41 ) . assumptions course information processing are supported number experiments concerned effect backward masking recognition pure tones , recognition letters . speech obviously raises number specific issues domain , however . unlike written words , speech is temporal phenomenon , is continuous ( . e . are systematic acoustic boundaries between phonemes , syllables , words ) , furthermore , per se serves source information speech , pointed massaro ( e . g . vowel duration is major cue voicing following obstruent , one example ) . somewhat regrettably , few indications are given model assessed speech domain ( remarks p . 194 p . 263 ) . addition discussing dynamics processing , massaro examines temporal relations between sources information are dealt pattern recognition . chapter 3 focuses our sensitivity temporal asynchronies between visible audible speech . experiments reported chapter , bimodal cv syllables various degrees onset asynchrony between auditory synthetic speech visible synthetic speech were presented subjects forced-choice identification task . results show integration between two sources information still occurs sources information are made asynchronous , provided shift does exceed certain duration . one major challenge phoneticians psycholinguists alike is characterize relationship between called * external * dynamics speech , . e . temporal organization speech signal , * internal * course speech processing . both play role perception speech , is most difficult tell apart respective influences listener 's behaviour ( samuel , 1996 ) . example , gating study investigating role vowel duration cue voicing post-vocalic stop cvc syllables , warren marslen - wilson ( 1988 ) found proportion voiced-coda responses increased listeners were presented increasingly long portions initial cv sequence . one obvious interpretation is longer vowels were perceived being associated voiced coda rather voiceless ones . keeping massaro 's dynamical flmp , however , assumed evaluating information provided vowel takes , evidence pointing voiced coda gradually accumulates processing is made available listener , things being equal . thus , above finding raises issue differentiate effect vowel duration per se listener 's response , internal dynamics processing . although issue is directly addressed book , is doubt flmp constitute most appropriate framework further investigations domain . 2 . 3 general conclusion book provides us quite extensive review work carried author others multiple cues speech perception , generally , pattern recognition . is aimed large audience , constitutes most useful tool both teaching research purposes . doubt soon become major reference researchers phonetics , psycholinguistics , cognitive psychology . 4 bibliography liberman , . m .
