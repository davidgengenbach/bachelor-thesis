evaluation parsing systems workshop jointly organised cec language engineering 1 projects sparkle ecran held first international conference language resources evaluation granada , spain , 26 1998 workshop provide forum researchers interested development evaluation natural language grammars parsing systems , creation syntactically annotated reference corpora . organisers : john carroll , roberto basili , nicoletta calzolari , robert gaizauskas , gregory grefenstette workshop scope aims aim workshop is provide forum discussion evaluation methods parsing systems , proposals development syntactically annotated language resources . increased attention evaluation component technology language engineering , evaluation parsing systems is rapidly becoming key issue . numerous methods been proposed while one , parseval / penn treebank scheme , has gained wide usage , has extent been due absence workable alternatives rather whole-hearted support . parseval / ptb evaluation has several limitations drawbacks , including commitment particular style grammatical analysis , oversensitivity certain innocuous types misanalysis while failing penalise common types serious mistake . , original published description scheme - - evaluation software widely distributed follow-up - - is specific english language . are currently alternative workable schemes proposals , needs fully discussed : workshop provide opportunity debate . workshop is particularly timely given large number cec language engineering projects involve parsing one form another need evaluate share results efforts . parsing is essential part many larger applications , information extraction , gained importance over few years . often systems , strength parser grammar has direct effect desired results , thus achieving results rests being able determine improve weaknesses parser / grammar . without reliable parser evaluation method cannot done effectively . parsing evaluation workshop is appropriate given imminent creation large-scale syntactically annotated resources european languages . contributions those involved activities are welcomed , improve communication between resource construction resource utilisation communities . ensure resources constructed are maximally useful general language engineering community . organisation workshop brings together two european language engineering projects are closely related whose partners share similar research interests : sparkle ecran . organisers solicit contributions general community following topics : - descriptions generic syntactic annotation schemes - methodologies metrics parsing system evaluation - reports analyses results utilising particular parser evaluation schemes - description / analysis / experience language-dependent ( especially languages english ) task-dependent syntactic annotation schemes programme committee roberto basili gregory grefenstette ted briscoe mark hepple nicoletta calzolari tony mcenery john carroll maria teresa pazienza roberta catizone paola velardi robert gaizauskas yorick wilks paper submission papers exceed 4000 words 10 pages . submission either hard copy electronic form . submission deadline is february 15th , 1998 . hard copy submission : three copies paper sent : dr john carroll cognitive computing sciences university sussex brighton bn1 9qh uk electronic submission : electronic submission either self-contained latex , postscript , rtf formats , john . carroll @ cogs . susx . ac . uk . each submission - - whether hard copy electronic - - separate plain ascii text email message sent john carroll , containing following information : # name : name first author # title : title paper # pages : number pages # note : relevant instructions # keys : keywords # email : email first author # abstr : abstract paper . . . . . . important dates paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) february 15th notification acceptance march 10th camera - ready papers due april 10th workshop 26th conference information general information conference is : http : / / www . icp . inpg . fr / elra / conflre . html specific queries conference directed : lrec secretariat facultad de traduccion e interpretacion dpto . de traduccion e interpretacion c / puentezuelas , 55 18002 granada , spain tel : + 34 58 24 41 00 - fax : + 34 58 24 41 04 reli98 @ goliat . ugr . es
