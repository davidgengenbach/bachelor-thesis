' original though fallible conjectures test against objective reality ' ( p . 137 - quotes are _ ee _ unless otherwise indicated ) . eventually , using method , each individual comes learn language . learn are ' wholly cultural constructs ' ( p . 137 ) , e - language rather - language , chomsky 's terminology . note conception language _ ee _ is totally different those chomsky , jackendoff , bickerton pinker . nativists , language cannot belong society rather individual . issue is actually addressed book . _ ee _ merely states language is cultural artifact biological , does furnish evidence claim . book states popper 's belief mind is amenable scientific theorising ( p . 138 ) . am unable evidence book support claim . however , one assumes mind is outside domain scientific inquiry simply becomes impossible engage debate merits specifics nativist theory . first task book undertakes is demolish chomsky 's arguments nativism ( sourcing material 1991 ) demolish 's econd wave ' nativists - pinker foremost second wave . book utilises many arguments , noteworthy others , beyond scope review examine . few arguments , less random . arguments against chomsky centre sampson perceives basis nativism : 1 : speed acquisition 2 : age - dependence 3 : poverty data 4 : convergence among grammars 5 : language universals 6 : species - specificity _ ee _ claims first argument ( speed acquisition ) is hollow is determining exactly 's peed ' area . however , seems uncontroversial enough children acquire language faster adults without problems adults encounter . is attempt book address notion whether different languages are acquired different speeds whether different children acquiring same language radically different sequences . seem distinct possibility innate language specific faculty rather rely generalised learning mechanism . evidence regarding language acquisition across languages helped case conclusive . book dealt data available order show non-nativist account language acquisition capture facts . instead _ ee _ relies notion popperian account cope nativist account is closer ' common sense ' view language . does prove popperian account is right . chomsky 's second argument ( age - dependence ) is dismissed , book states , humans learn language age " task worthwhile " ( p . 36 ) . however , author does describe procedure assessing worthwhileness task . why child worthwhile learn language needs are being met compliant adults responding non-linguistic communication is addressed . early vocalisations children are evidence beginnings language acquisition , child is deciding early age language is ' worthwhile ' , stage seems difficult believe child is weighing options worthwhile . following logic extend criterion " worthwhileness " ' learning ' ' learning walk ' eliminate innate component . book states are " plenty cases record adults mastering second language native-speaker standard apart accent " ( p . 36 ) ; am quite sure might mean achieve native-speaker standard apart accent . book suggests - without providing crucial evidence - - is " learning general process is biological reasons far rapid before puberty after " ( p . 37 ) . is supposed show age dependence is proof critical period language acquisition using innate language acquisition device - - critical period being one features is characteristic innate behaviour . age dependence , according book , falls slowing down learning process general after puberty . , however , seems contradict argument against age dependence ; adult master second language native speaker standard . author states " susan curtiss herself regarded genie refuting strong version lenneberg 's claim , natural language acquisition cannot occur after puberty " ( p . 37 ) . susan curtiss might want respond one herself . understanding work genie is genie did language ( is , rule-governed creative linguistic behaviour ) was able achieve anything close native speaker competence while under observation ( curtiss , p . 204 ) even though indeed been ' worthwhile ' . furthermore linguistic development did follow same course children acquiring language normally . suggests genie 's ability learn language was diminished due age important point is cognitive development areas seemed affected . been worthwhile chelsea learned language , yet chelsea did achieve native speaker standard ( jackendoff 's _ patterns mind _ ) . third argument presented chomsky nativism , according book , is poverty data during acquisition . arguments against chomsky presented book bear close scrutiny . according book , motherese provides " graded series language lessons " ( p . 39 ) is degenerate , poverty data argument states . is particularly ( references cited author are early 70s ) . fact is , however , really yet role - - motherese plays learning / acquiring language . one thing worth noting is is language teaching theory proposes adults most effectively taught second language through being taught motherese . is true yet exist conclusive studies universality motherese ( although wide variety language groups studied show high degree similarity ) . cultures motherese seems play less role is different motherese english speaking world . fact motherese child directed speech seems task learning / acquiring language much easier does is allow high degree socialisation . seen fact simplification structure decreased greatly parent child were longer presence observer merely being taped . motherese wa s benefit child . course , language is innate are left problem explaining child directed speech is perfectly " graded series language lessons " infant , despite fact adults are taught language lessons , perhaps empiricist ability " graded series lessons " language is innate . author states popperian account language learning allow child determine general principles input ( adult wants learn language ) . is important nativist account holds basic principles language are innate thus are available determining is going language input . individuals learning language via popperian method learning abilities work general principles input without principles being already available head . are cases * specific language impairment * where rate learning / acquisition language seems different areas learning ? whole basis popperian analysis is language acquisition is different domain where learning occurs . consequently , predicts difference between acquisition language learning cognitive domains . prediction runs counter reported facts clearly presented yamada 's 1990 book ' laura : case study modularity language ' . arguing against chomsky , author takes chomsky 's much used example english speaking children determining ask yes / questions . is seeking show chomsky is being dishonest analysis verifying data . child working yes / question english has work verb is moved has verb main clause first verb encountered sentence . work , child has distinguish between verbs words between main verbs auxiliary verbs knowing structure phrases sentence . child has work auxiliary verbs main clause move beginning sentence main verbs appear infinitive while tensed 'd o ' occurs beginning sentence . chomsky 's point is children learn distinctions move appropriate verb appropriate position form yes / question great ease . both author chomsky agree analysis rule involved forming yes / question where differ is belief * exposure * children yes / questions where main clause is first clause sentence rather subordinate clause appears first , : is man is talking bill wearing gloves ? chomsky 's claim is child encounter question language s / hears before determining rule yes / question formation . _ ee _ argues sentences are indeed present language children hear . book actually has prove is children hear crucial form yes / question before determine yes / question formation rule . is shown instead is argued structures are available children read ; children n't read learn language . indeed is quite possible children form rule yes / question formation before ever learn read . author claims shows chomsky is ' wildly mistaken ' ( p . 42 ) , paraphrases situation follows : " . . man is world 's leading living intellectual , according cambridge university second plato is basing radical reassessment human nature largely claim certain thing never happens ; tells us strains credulity might happen , has never looked , looked happens lot . " ( p . 42-43 ) looked are sampson himself geoff pullum ( p . 42 ) checked sources written language said ignores fact illiterate children speak . fact , enamoured is author written word argues , historically , hypotaxis emerges literacy develops . somehow organisation involved writing leads great leaps forward language . does finally admit is great research topic blames linguistics departments ( " is popular topic research linguistics departments " , p . 75 ) . is nothing prevent taping speakers modern pre-literate languages - one cultures classed pre-literate without qualifications - order test occurrence hypotaxis author does n't seem u ndertaken task . book does n't opt fully idea was little hypotaxis languages ancient pre-literate cultures author states , hedging bets : " was little hypotaxis languages " [ hebrew old testament etc . ] " is real difference between recent languages " . ( p . 75 ) obvious reasons never answer question whether was hypotaxis hebrew before writing indeed while writing was still fairly recent innovation . is true serious investigation parataxis subordination various languages has been carried goes back over one hundred years . book claims " was cliche late nineteenth century linguistics early stages languages long recorded history showed development was called parataxis hypotaxis " ( p . 74 ) . cites great linguists karl brugmann , hermann paul eduard hermann support notion languages paratactic stage hypotactic stage . are two problems . firstly , nineteenth century linguists been happy notion hypotaxis emerged writing developed . hermann jacobi 's 1897 work ' composition und nebensatz ' concluded " maori , early stages pie had contained relative particle " subordination ( lehmann , p . 60 ) . jacobi is claiming pie did subordination is basis hypotaxis brugmann , paul hermann . secondly , is really reason believe nineteenth century linguists got everything right comparative historical linguistics . idea hypotaxis emerged previous stage must seen alongside ideas nineteenth century linguistics development languages primitive systems complex systems . fourth argument book looks is convergence among grammars - notion varying levels intelligence exposure different language inputs , converge same grammar . book claims ( p . 46 ) chomsky has admitted educated mother tongue better . does fit - language approach is obviously representative chomsky 's theory language . - language approach excludes possibility mother tongue ( e - language ) mastered varying degrees . chomsky things english hungarian swahili exist meaningful . is controversial , point is chomsky is mother tongue divorced individual 's knowledge . second line argument identified sampson is actually converge same grammar different grammatical judgments response same data . book refers labov 's work - presented austerlitz ( 1974 ) - where respondents varied judgments grammaticality presented sentences . really interesting thing here is taking test understood instructions - oral written - were given concerning test . is hard same understanding was said unless had pretty much same grammars . language was used instructions most likely contained variety syntactic constructions , are reports completing test remarking ungrammaticality instructions were given . is easy varying groups even individuals over ask assess sentences : ' every one boys did n't ' . fact individuals differ judgment over shows is being tested is individual 's competence adult 's competence does vary - although performance might . large number factors determine whether individual judge sentence one given above perfectly grammatical borderline totally ungrammatical . fact is variation reported judgments does fact constitute argument against convergence among grammars is test grammars rather test performance . intuitions sentences involving scope relations quantifiers negation vary many factors bear performance . book contends ( pp . 107 - 137 ) existence language universals explained fact popperian learning system automatically yield universals . are result nature language faculty instead derive popperian system learning . again , author does show popperian account is better nativist account capturing facts . case against nativism is proven , those language universals agree exist must explicable either within popperian system * * least explained better popperian learning theory . book does . book targets pinker 's ' language instinct ' . why sampson decides devote much effort book is somewhat puzzling . pinker 's book is aimed fairly general audience is really worthwhile target . among arguments against pinker assumption surnames are actual words individual languages . means existence person england 's ri ' first three letters surname means 's ri ' is possible initial consonant cluster english ( p . 83 ) . author can't resist taking pot-shot imagines pinker 's political views . tone response pinker is one condescension irritating detracts points author trying being irrelevant substantive issues . worst attack is saved bickerton . book seeks portray intellectual lightweight most unappealing ( p . 76 ) : " [ bickerton 's ] stuff must real hit green students hawaii " . is surely too much expect personal abuse kept realm intellectual debate . book takes jackendoff stating jackendoff writes : " jackendoff is one best writers among linguistic nativists " ( p . 76 ) , forgiving being nativist . " jackendoff reaches word ' instinct ' hastily cases , trust word judiciously where are real questions resolved " ( p . 79 ) . main issue picked jackendoff 's work relates sign language . one stage author says ( arguing against jackendoff 's analysis universal grammar ) : " jackendoff has shortly beforehand pointed one aspect american sign language grammar is paralleled spoken language . sign-language equivalent third person pronouns ( , , ) consists gesturing ( hand shapes movements depend whether reference is singular , plural possessive ) locations signing space been assigned successive topics conversations . ' effect is are many different third-person pronouns available are discernible locations signing space ' . spoken language has pronoun system remotely , part our innate knowledge . " ( p . 78 ) author is missing point here . sign language expresses person , number , gender possession spoken language does features found spoken language . system same spoken language . pronouns sign language is exactly same pronouns spoken language is based universal grammar , is different is modality . availability signing space means signer introduce greater number pronouns discourse each pronoun allocated location signing space without leading confusion . is same fact many second person singular pronouns wanted long looked individual was addressing pronoun . looking person was referring pronoun is really same signer using sign space tag pronouns . is true second person pronouns . talking , , members football team refer each individual using third person pronoun . quite clear own head is being picked each , confusing person was talking . is distinguish referents each pronouns . sign language exploit possibility signing space tagging each meaning pronoun location space whole thing does confusing . potential both oral sign language is same , sign exploit signing space oral language cannot . point is limitations are imposed language modality . jackendoff is saying is same universal grammar underlies language matter modality . chapter book ( ' creative mind ' ) presents sampson 's view popper . is without problems author devotes much arguing popper did n't always mean said sampson 's analysis popper is best . however , crucial lines chapter purposes nature vs . nurture are : " minds are topic open scientific theorising . " ( p . 139 ) " position adopted book is conscious human minds are physical entities . talking minds is talking high-level aspects brain functioning . minds bodies are different separate things act one another . " ( p . 138 ) those believe minds are indeed topic open scientific theorising render anything else book has suspect . modern nativists ( most non-nativists ) view mind amenable scientific theorising . chomsky is possible study mind ( chomsky 1993 , 1995 ) . is hard significant debate place between two opposite points view . author is committed cause popperian analysis language learning / acquisition never able convert nativist thinking until gain understanding motivations adopting nativist position reconcile himself possibility nativism stance intelligent person adopt . author seems imagine himself fighting rear guard action against hordes misguided nativists , sees , are close winning hearts minds masses . one important aspect book is read means testing one feels linguistic nativism . unfortunately sampson 's crusade , had effect making prefer nativist analysis even before .
