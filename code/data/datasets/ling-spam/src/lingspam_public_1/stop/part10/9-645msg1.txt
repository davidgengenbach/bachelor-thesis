' similarly , descriptions are stated terms surface phenomena grammatical constructions recognizable theoretical framework . is probably right choice , given diverse backgrounds probable users grammar . range coverage is broad thorough . kornfilt deals sentence types , both simple complex ; negation questions ; grammatical categories phrase types ; most grammatical phenomena might interest linguists . morphology chapter contains information inflection derivation , uses various morphological forms . cross - referencing is extensive , making easy reader relevant information topic even is found same section book . approach interrelating syntax morphology is useful allows kornfilt clarify cloudy areas turkish grammar . perhaps most notable are treatments participial nominal systems relation subordination ( pp . 323-413 various places chapter 1 ) . finite subordination is rare turkish . far frequent pattern subordination involves participial nominalized verbal stem . complexity system is mind-boggling students language , kornfilt 's description makes coherent intelligible . treatment aspects turkish morphology syntax are equally done . useful feature turkish is inclusion information does * * occur language . is often essential information linguists ( whether studying typology , syntax , morphology ) is rarely included traditional grammars . thus page 104 statement postpostitions govern one case ( lone exception ' kadar ' ) . lewis ( 1967 ) , information inferred discussion cases pages 85-95 , is easy categorically stated . are many similar examples , especially syntax chapter . chapter phonology is short , clear , precise , does contain amount detail found syntax morphology chapters . while information presented adequate many purposes , phonologists doubt wish elaborate discussions issues vowel harmony , stress assignment , phonological ( morphophonemic ) alternations . found one omission chapter . page 491 , final devoicing rule is described applying syllable-final plosives affricates , yet page 487 are examples final devoicing liquids , described being standard universal . cross-reference been useful here . most part , transcriptions phonology chapter follow ipa norms . one exception , though , is transcription palatalized consonants means comma rather raised j . ' while been done typographical reasons , might confuse casual user . chapter 4 , ideophones interjections , is 3 pages long provides briefest commentary phenomena . while many linguists ( myself included ) mind short shrift given topics , doubt disappointed list ideophones occupies less page half . chapter 5 , lexicon , is short interesting sample lexicon turkish . chapter contains lists words organized semantic field . include kinship terminology , color terms , body parts , cooking terminology . included is list over 200 items " basic vocabulary , " seems correspond so-called swadesh list . linguists interested historical linguistics language classification grateful set words conveniently collected together . setting aside minor qualifications , reference work turkish linguists , turkish has equal . is comprehensive , date , effectively organized description language . method organization , detailed table contents index , wealth information available almost instantaneously . is , simply put , admirable reference work turkish linguists . same said utility turkish non-linguists . are two main reasons why book accessible non-linguistic audiences . first , kornfilt assumes familiarity linguistic terminology . first paragraph page 1 , example , uses terms ' nominalized clause ' ' constituent clause , ' neither is likely familiar non-linguists . second , turkish presupposes interest knowledge certain linguistic questions . kornfilt has little , example , questions stylistic variation , formal versus colloquial speech , range topics typical student scholar turkish might interested . is really criticism , since descriptive grammar series has defined audience excludes non-linguists . nevertheless , is unfortunate grammar useful wider audience . supplement replace lewis ( 1976 ) underhill ( 1976 ) . two complaints turkish . first , is relatively large number errors inconsistencies . most are minor consist missing ' - s 's verbs , using ' ' ' , ' etc . , cause confusion . page 27 , example , turkish is described 's ubject-verb - object language .
