eventualities temporal reasoning . book combines approach 's desire lose information previously given discourse semantic principles are squarely based situation semantics . allows introduce dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) , loosely described temporal inference pumps . ter meulen points , though common sense reasoning plays important role temporal reasoning , is aim deal . finally present paperback edition book incorporates appendix giving exercises dat construction short account resemblance difference between drt dats . 1 . 0 book summary preface ter meulen aims account linguistic informational balance between static dynamic information , proposing abstract semantic principles relative tense aspect using tools derived situation semantics . 1 . introduction language describes world being composed two main types temporal objects : events introduce changes states . linguistic capacity is accompanied inferential ability interpretation is is case . ter meulen deals simple past , perfect , progressive uses present , is tenses indicate order events occur , through weak constraints temporal relations between events . difference between simple past perfect is aspectual , is obvious are examined light difference between events states : simple past describes events context-dependent while perfect gives stative information . aspect seen imposing control flow information here ter meulen introduces three main universal aspectual classes , holes , filters plugs are closely related , respectively , vendler 's classical ontological classes activities ( " john ran half hour " ) , accomplishments ( " john built house " ) achievements ( " john won race " ) . ter meulen introduces notion situated reasoning : according , is temporal vantage point text reasoning text proceed . is first ( descriptive ) factor . second ( aspectual ) factor is source information , while third factor is perspective information . temporal information is processed against context ( given ) incorporates least lexicon syntax language , situated logical inference rules , semantic constraints ( presuppositions ) , available information elements situation . 2 . aspectual verbs aspectual verbs describe internal structure events are , english , " start " , " begin " , " commence " , " initiate " , " resume " ( event beginnings ) , " continue " , " keep " ( event middles ) " end " , " finish " , " terminate " , " halt " , " cease " , " complete " ( event endings ) . aspectual verbs describing middle end event carry anaphoric presupposition ( assumptions previous existence event , event ) . aspectual verbs describing onset event semantically indefinite existential character . verbs describing middle event are quantificational verbs holes . verbs describing ending events filters plugs depending whether finished ( plugs ) ended ( holes ) . are pairs aspectual verbs linked semantic contrary relation , " start / finish " , " stop / resume " , " resume / finish " , " keep / end " , " continue / end " . dat 's , events are complex objects , constituted individuals , relations positive negative polarity . events classified similarity classes types based parts . type consists relation , objects positive negative polarity , indicating whether relation holds does hold between objects . types include parameters indeterminate objects used constituent apart polarities . given situation supports type matches constituents . types including parameters ( parametric types ) , support depends existence situation objects corresponding parameter satisfying both relation polarity . aspectual verbs described terms monotonicity : inferences , given aspectual verbs , are valid smaller parts larger parts , verb is monotone increasing , while inferences are valid larger parts smaller parts , verbs are monotone decreasing . ter meulen proposes aspectual cube , is cube allowing representation relations between aspectual verbs monotonicity properties . each vortex cube has two vertical arrows first represents dynamic plugs ( upward arrow ) / static holes ( downward arrow ) while second represents increasing ( upward arrow ) decreasing ( downward arrow ) monotonicity . cube visualizes dynamic transitions beginning + start ; stopping " end " " finish " . bottom corresponds stative holes , while top corresponds dynamic plugs , allowing four combinations arrows english : dynamic plugs + increasing monotonicity , dynamic plugs + decreasing monotonicity , stative holes + increasing monotonicity , stative holes + descreasing monotonicity . external negation flips left arrow changing dynamicity , while internal negation flips right arrow . finally , is arrow kinematics , whereby combinations arrow given above gives dynamic stative aspect , being always determined right arrow ( . e . value combination is always value right arrow ( upward = plug ; downward = hole ) . 3 . dynamic aspect trees ( dats ) dats are graphically representing information events directed graphs where nodes , labeled descriptive information , either holes plugs . each dat has unique source node ( plug ) , is rightmost terminal node , corresponding utterance event determining perspective . information past tense has preceded source is represented nodes branch left . present information include source . thus left-to - right order represents flow while downward arrows represent temporal inclusion . dats are used temporal reasoning past ( though allow modalities counterfactuals ) . is dat single root node , dominating nodes , including source , representing entire episode described . is current node , is constructed one opened ( hole ) closed ( plug ) , property determining next information processed . current node is plug , information represented node descending one current node 's parent nodes , usually lowest compatible parent node . simple past tense clauses introduce nodes , while states , quantificational relations , perfect clauses " " progressive clauses are introduced stickers current node , is plug , next node , is hole . stickers are portable transmitted nodes dat grows . introducing node independent current one indicates change perspective . path connecting set labeled nodes root is chronoscope current chronoscope is one containing current node . compatibility relations ( are symmetric , reflexive transitive ) are determined both lexically through entailment relations between types same chronoscope . notion chronoscope is one main device temporal reasoning dats , allowing persistence , . e . preservation information . however , temporal reasoning depends current node , search conclusion starting current node . dats are structured semantic objects rather linguistic expressions , follow semantic rules . are interpreted event structures are embedded allow temporal reasoning obey semantic constraints . interpretability text depends possibility constructing dat embedded event structure obeying constraints . embedded dat describes episode event structure is embedded provides values . text is true episode described dat is part world . 4 . states , generic information constraints stative information are always represented stickers nodes dats , states are permanent others , difference being represented portability conditions perspective shifts . are thus rules downward portability conditions stickers portability conditions accommodation . portability conditions differ perfect states progressive states . generic stative information is represented stickers imported upward depending whether property is predicated under default members given category whether is predicated category itself rather members whether appears conditionals under temporal quantification . 5 . perspectives dat gives certain perspective episode describes same episode described different dats , each giving different perspective . means dats same episode lead different conclusions . changes perspective depend rule used updating : hole sticker rules change perspective , plug filler rules . words , changes chronoscope correspond changes perspective depend status current node . is , however , perspective creating chronoscope updating dat : possibility goes through perspective refinement . perspective refinement corresponds unplugging plug turns hole , allowing addition information under . notion perspective is strongly dependent compatibility information , generally , coherence is one merits dat allow precise content rather slippery notion coherence , relying rules dat construction notion chronoscope . perspective refinements usually correspond flashbacks consist three operations : unplugging nodes old chronoscopes , resetting current node old one making existing nodes nodes added independent though are dominated same ancestor . ter meulen proposes tentative definition flashback process . notes perspective allows perspective binding np anaphora proposes perspective constraint deal . finally ter meulen outlines possibility three-dimensional dats , third dimension allowing representation independent structures nodes , though communality root is preserved . three dimensional dats called scenarios though each part dats unique source still describe episode . parts scenarios incorporates different simultaneous episodes are scenes . 6 . fragment english chapter , ter meulen gives syntactic semantic account fragment english , " laboratory environment theory interpretation " ( 93 ) , recapitulation rules dat construction updating . 7 . epilogue dats allow simultaneous encoding three types information : aspectual control information through open / closed property nodes , temporal part / whole relations between events , descriptive information through types labeling nodes . dats are compatible aristotelian realism defined barwise perry , is , view structure information depends natural world . distinction made , according ter meulen between interpreting utterance extract information contains evaluating truth-value information . appendix appendix has been added paperback edition , ter meulen has provided exercises dat construction comparison between drt dats . comment second part appendix . ter meulen notes , dats stems partly drt . nevertheless though dat logic is developed enough allow complete comparison , are quite few differences between : dats account inference simple past past perfect progressive , portability conditions stative information chronoscopes aspectual verbs , drt does ; drt accounts temporal adverbials temporal interpretation subordinate clauses , dats ; dats substitute notion current chronoscope notion temporal reference point used drt . finally dats characterize valid logic inference depending crucially current node , while drt characterizes valid logic inference classically , logical consequence . 1 . 1 . critical evaluation ter meulen 's book is highly stimulating , original interesting . must read anyone interested , tense aspect . criticisms leveled against one reason : fact book is much too short . means though is clear enough , is rather difficult read . is quite frustrating , instance , though ter meulen does explain construct dats ( chapter 3 ) gives detailed rules , is enough step step examples dats book ( example , was kamp reyle 1993 ) . much same , one liked much detailed comparison alternative accounts , drt , parsonian account events , generally , aktionsart . appendix , has been added paperback edition ( 1997 ) did exist first hardback edition ( 1995 ) , is really enough satisfy both complaints . ter meulen 's book hints relation between reference objects reference ( indefiniteness argument nps given verb influence interpretation clause , , notably , aspect ) . hints are interesting , again , longer book might given author scope develop those intuitions . thus one hope interesting book followed bigger one , dat logic developed fully , contrasted alternative approaches where ter meulen describe precisely suggestions regarding perspective interaction between semantic aspect dats commonsense reasoning whose necessity acknowledges does deal book . finally , ter meulen 's book was published same pustejovsky 's work lexicon , thus does n't pustejovsky 's system . nice intersection between approaches made . references kamp , h . & reyle , u .
