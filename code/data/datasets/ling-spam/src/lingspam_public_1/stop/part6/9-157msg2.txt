call papers , sle 31 , st andrews , scotland , 26-30 august 1998 workshop modality generative grammar description analysis modality is central interest study human language . modality interacts many subsystems syntax better understanding modality further our understanding subsystems greatly . relevant subsystems play role existing analyses epistemic-deontic dichotomy . has been attributed : ( ) argument structure ( e . g . ross 1969 ) : epistemic modals are one-place predicates ( corresponding raising verbs syntactically ) , whereas deontic modals are two-place predicates ( corresponding control verbs syntactically ) . ( ii ) insertion position : epistemic modals are generated , deontic modals v ( e . g . picallo 1990 ) . ( iii ) lf position : epistemic modals are c , deontic modals vp ( e . g . mcdowell 1987 ) . ( iv ) nature complement modal : definite verbal complement epistemic modals indefinite verbal complement deontic modals ( e . g . barbiers 1995 ) . v ) pragmatics : dichotomy is contextually determined does correspond syntactic difference ( kratzer 1989 ) . many questions still need answered before sufficiently adequate analysis developed . argument structure , asked evidence each modal has two different argument structures . evidence exists , are argument structures represented lexicon , theta-theoretic accounts , syntactically ? related questions concern categorial status modals ( special category aux english , main verbs german dutch ) , selectional restrictions impose complement ( semantically uniform , syntactically : verbal complements english , categorial restrictions dutch , verbal certain prepositional complements german afrikaans ) . syntactic position surface structure lf , need ( scopal ) interaction modals negation . is clear is tight connection between modality negation / affirmation : many languages modal behaves negative polarity item ( english ` need ' , german ` brauchen ' , dutch ` hoeven ' ) . related issue is interaction modals focus particles , especially those negative affirmative import , english ` ' french ` bien ' . seems focus particles alter syntactic semantic behaviour modals . ( scopal ) interaction modals quantifiers modals question operators is need better description analysis . has been claimed question formation epistemic modality exclude each . although does seem hold general , question formation epistemic modality seem restrict each ways are poorly understood . interaction modal verbs modal adverbials is relevant determination syntactic position modals , particulary view cinque 's ( 1997 ) hypothesis every sentence contains two modal projections must either filled modal adverbial specifier modal verb head . many languages construction ` ' ` ' involves modal interpretation . constructions generally epistemic interpretation ( consider english ` was never again ' , dutch ` het is te verwachten dat . . . ' ` is expected . . . ' ) . are great many cross-linguistic peculiarities point , are worth exploring . example , one question is type construction , lacking visible modal element , yields modal interpretation . is general question concerning modality : properties modals are necessary modality are accidental ? cross - linguistically , modals often irregular present tense inflection paradigm . is unclear whether is necessary property modals , why . fact english modals are auxilaries modals languages are is presumably accidental property , is fact english modals lack infinitives participles paradigm , whereas dutch modals infinitival participial forms ( except verb ` zullen ' ` ' ) . seems bulk generative studies modality involves germanic languages , particularly invite papers modality romance central european languages . organizers : sjef barbiers ( leiden ) , frits beukema ( leiden ) , olga tomic ( novi sad ) , milena milojevic sheppard ( ljubljana ) , marija golden ( ljubljana ) . please submit abstract ( 1 a4 max ) : professor olga miseska tomic bulevar avnoja 109 / iii , stan 16 beograd yu 11070 yugoslavija e - mail : efilb01 @ yubgss21 . bg . ac . yu & dr sjef barbiers hil / department dutch studies p . n . van eyckhof 3 leiden , nl 2300 ra netherlands e - mail : barbiers @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl & dr frits beukema hil / department english p . n . van eyckhof 4 leiden , nl 2300 ra netherlands e - mail : beukema @ rullet . leidenuniv . nl closing date submission abstract : 15 1998 date acceptance / rejection abstract : 1 july 1998
