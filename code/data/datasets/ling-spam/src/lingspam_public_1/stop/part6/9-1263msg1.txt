[ editor 's note : following is second part review beerman et al . _ righward movement _ . first part is found previous issue linguist . ] most frank drijkoningen 's paper ` morphological strength : np positions french ' ( pp . 81-114 ) is devoted clever account relative ordering subjects verbs , parts thereof , french , especially focus inversion constructions , demonstrating data described manner consistent kayne 's antisymmetry theory - - provided one adopts certain amount occam - stretching multiplication functional heads resultant multiple spec - positions ` homes ' subjects . drijkoningen argues fairly convincingly following hierarchical ordering functional heads french : [ c [ t [ agr ( s ) [ agr ( o ) [ agr ( ) [ vp ] ] ] ] ] ] , identifying participial agreement agr ( o ) agr ( ) , checking-site predicate - adjective agreement . offers hypothesis regard trigger french stylistic inversion ( subject np follows verbal complex ) . assumption is ( both french english ) spec - head agr features infl are ` strong ' , while head - features infl are ` strong ' french ` weak ' english . however , overt saturation spec - head agr features cp ( e . g . , fronting overt wh-expression ) significantly reduces strength spec - head agr features ip , obviating need subject np rise spec - agr ( s ) checking . paper is characterized heavy reliance ` floating / stranded _ tous _ ' , . e . , quantifier separated superficially np modifies . reviewer found little evidence awareness possibility q - movement independent movement modified np ; many starred strings actually derived , assuming kayne approach , q were allowed move own . was sign argument movement is impossible ; perhaps ruled lack motivation . paper is thick , rather strong argument underlying svo exclusively leftward - movement french . course , few linguists contest french is svo , evidence rightward - movement language has always been best peripheral ( pun intended ) . given strong arguments rm head-finality languages presented bayer buring & hartmann , paper seems lot sound fury . erik hoekstra 's paper , ` analysing linear asymmetries verb clusters dutch frisian dialects ' ( pp . 153-170 ) , presents analysis terms kayne 's lca hypothesis syntax complex verb clusters especially characteristic languages . course discussion , gradually becomes clear , basis ordering elements within clusters , distinguishes between dutch frisian respectively ` head-initial ' ` head-final ' . is clear reviewer why labels are appropriate specifically regard internal syntax verb clusters , describing dutch ` head-initial ' is likely surprise many thought knew otherwise . discussing feasibility , lack thereof , inserting non - verbal material ( including particles ) between members verb cluster , hoekstra demonstrates follows reasonably lca - account is proposing claims ( p . 158 ) ` rigidity head-final clusters [ . e . , intolerance insertion ] . . . is mystery approach incorporating asymmetry . ' fact , makes perfect sense assume underlying head-final order derivation alternative orders rm verbal projections . reviewer is necessarily suggesting is * better * approach hoekstra 's lca - account , is certainly quite feasible , contrary apparent belief . section , hoekstra spends fair amount interesting discussion infinitivum - pro - participio ( ipp ) effect , whereby germanic languages ( e . g . , dutch ) ( perfective ) participle taking infinitive verb complement must itself surface form infinitive . primary questions issue hoekstra are : is formal grammatical nature ipp effect ? why is characteristic ( germanic ) languages others ? hoekstra argues ipp effect occurs languages perfective participle is marked prefix , e . g . germanic prefix ` ge - ' reflexes thereof , prefix occupies spec position verb is morphologically attached . since under circumstances spec position is already occupied , is impossible infinitive complement move position must , derivation crashes ; loophole exploited dutch ipp languages ( is , fact , traditional analysis germanic scholarship ) is substitution ` alternative ' form participle is morphophonologically identical infinitive ( therefore , hoekstra 's view , has obstructionist prefix ) . fact frisian does exhibit ipp effects , according analysis , is directly related fact frisian perfective participle is marked suffix . reviewer admits being familiar scholarly literature subject ipp , notes curiosity hoekstra 's claim ( p . 159 ) ` ipp effect is systematically absent head - final germanic dialects ' squared fact german , is clearly head-final sense hoekstra uses term , typically marks perfective participles prefix , indeed , exhibits ipp . few pages paper are devoted nice little discussion recent evolution ipp couple frisian dialects , hoekstra argues is due both cases remarkably heavy contact dutch . reviewer 's opinion , section represents desirable conjunction scholarship concerns sociolinguistics linguistic evolution one hand formal grammatical theory . paper ` movement japanese relative clauses ' ( pp . 171-185 ) , satoshi stanley koike argues relative clauses japanese , including ` externally-headed ' ones whose ` heads ' are ( apparently ) ` extracted ' right , accounted terms kayne lca - type analysis allowing spec - head - comp base structures leftward movement . noting certain problems resulting adopting kayne 's analysis , koike makes clear are almost certainly obviated ( * interesting * ) proposal * discourse-based * motivation leftward movement adoption kayne 's lca approach forces assume . koike 's hypothesis movement ip japanese cases is essentially stylistic movement , . e . , motivated pragmatic discourse considerations rather purely syntactic ones , least implies is pf - movement ( 1 ) account fact , order analysis right predictions , * * follow movement semantic ` head ' np - - latter being proper ` syntactic ' movement - ( 2 ) invisible far binding theory is concerned , binding theory being relevant primarily lf totally irrelevant pf , ( 3 ) subject relativized minimality either . paper ` rightward wh - movement american sign language ' ( pp . 247-278 ) , carol neidle , judy kegl , benjamin bahan , debra aarons , & dawn maclaughlin argue americal sign language ( asl ) exhibits head-final cp right-marginal spec landing-site wh - movement . note ( p . 267 ) proposal ` is partially consistent kayne 's claims universal ordering ' , places spec complement opposite sides head ; however , proposal differs kayne 's universal antisymmetry approach positing head-final structure cp while assuming head-initial structures complement-daughters . neidle et al . base much anti - lca argument fact certain syntactic features ( including polarity , + / - wh , etc . ) are asl expressed ` non-manual markers ' ( e . g . , facial expressions ) frequently spread over certain portions clauses are associated , plausible notion those portions defined c-command domains functional heads associated features . thus , possibility , lack thereof , spreading asl is taken symptomatic presence absence c-command relations ( p . 250 ) . is basis spreading argue landing-site wh - movement asl , is clearly right clause , nevertheless c-commands latter , demonstrate c-command facts are incompatible kayne - type analysis . briefly entertain analyses consistent kayne 's lca - hypothesis , involving raising c ip higher positions ( , note , must nevertheless below positions , e . g . landing-site topicalization , known above cp asl ) , point is ( 1 ) evidence functional nature positions , ( 2 ) independent motivation existence , ( 3 ) evident motivation movement are discussing . paper ` language types generative grammar : review consequences univeral vo hypothesis ' ( pp . 331-357 ) , caterina donati & alessandra tomaselli address repercussions kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis constituent-order typological studies . demonstrate neatly elegantly manifold empirical problems kayne 's approach has languages representing variety types , including ( 1 ) ov languages v2 ( german , dutch ) , ( 2 ) svo languages without pro-drop ( english , french ) , ( 3 ) svo languages pro-drop ( italian ) , ( 4 ) vso languages ( irish ) . repeatedly , demonstrate traditional analyses provide accurate results analyses assuming kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis . noted donati & tomaselli are throughout addressing specifically relative ordering verbs nominals ordinary , garden-variety clauses ; details extraposed structures those discussed bayer , buring & hartmann , haider are addressed paper . while already noted half papers collection , understandably , discuss ` extraposition ' , is unfortunate are papers focussing ( pun intended ) adverbal focus-movement , serious alternative candidate rm analysis ( cf . schaufele 1990 , 1998 ) . neidle et al . 's paper relates focus indirect , is commonly assumed wh-elements are priori focussed therefore s - structure location , especially is anything remarkable , considered least possible landing-site focus-movement . sort appendix , koike offers short discussion rightward focus-movement turkish , suggests same kind discourse-analysis motivation proposes movement leftward ` backgrounded ' relative clauses ( away semantic ` heads ' ) japanese motivate movement leftward * non-focussed * arguments turkish , leaving focussed subject stranded immediately pre-verbal position ( least terms superficial order ) . reviewer notes , however , koike makes reference single turkish example , simple clause involving three constituents , object np , subject np , verb , doubts much account proposes able much sense much complex examples subject-focussing discussed schaufele 1990 , 1998 . complaints muller 's hoekstra 's papers expository level , both assumed part reader high degree familiarity languages being discussed . muller provides english translations german example sentences , matter one hindi example sentence . while reviewer has little trouble reading interpreting example sentences languages , facility cannot expected most readers collection . likewise , hoekstra offered translations example sentences , many cases reviewer , is unfamiliar wide variety germanic languages , was quite unable sense . furthermore , is frequently made clear language example question is meant represent ; since paper whole depends crucially distinctions between dutch frisian , is source serious obscurity . p . 158 , 6th page fairly short paper , does hoekstra finally tell us gloss ` mp ' stands ` modal particle ' , after having used abbreviation freely several earlier examples . abbreviation familiar specialists netherlandic , is n't lot interested readers . koike 's paper inclusion japanese words midst english - language text without typographical highlighting either quotes italics , especially book many typographical errors , proved little unsettling ; was problem muller 's paper , where was particularly confusing one section discussed extraposition english . book whole is plagued typographical errors . are two examples ( 59 ) drijkoningen 's paper . haider 's ( 58a ) is starred , is fact ok string , 's obvious context haider regards ok . buring & hartmann 's paper , are exs . ( 21a ) ( 22a ) , ( 21b ) ( 22b ) ; diagram ( 24 ) is nowhere referred text ( though 's pretty obvious refers ) . [ bayer press ] is referred several times bayer 's paper , does n't appear anywhere references ; perhaps 's represented bayer 1996 ? statement wiltschko 's locality constraint is misprinted p . 360 nonsensical . koike 's paper alignment glosses ( 20a ) was impossible sense , had study ( 10 ) while before realized , although said literally ` [ dp ip d [ cp np / qp [ c [ ip . . . ' , those biliterals ` dp ' , ` cp ' , ` ip ' were instances meant labels immediately preceding brackets , left-daughters constituents enclosed within said brackets . mahajan 's paper is particularly plagued typographical errors ; mention merely most egregious example found , ( 54 ) entire direct object np is missing hindi string , rendering example 's relevance discussion is completely opaque . already noted here , many substantive flaws collection are due primarily entirely lack space present relevant arguments . fulfilling preface 's promise open-mindedness , book brings together papers several different viewpoints , both supporting undermining kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis . while many contributors obviously hold rather strongly whatever side controversy espouse , many are commended skill seriousness nevertheless necessary task considering possible alternative analyses support side . while many papers focus languages , constructions within those languages , already been much discussed generative literature , are admirable exceptions ; especially mention papers bayer , hoekstra , neidle et al . regard , typological interest behind paper donati & tomaselli although restrict themselves primarily western european languages . anyone concerned understanding debates arising kayne 's antisymmetry hypothesis grounds both taking seriously rejecting cannot afford ignore collection . references . bayer , josef .
