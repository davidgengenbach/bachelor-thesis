" words " title refers two claims g&m : one , children 's early vocabulary reflects technical notions theory du jour two , linguistic elements act part evidence children theory building . book is divided three sections , addition introduction conclusion . first section addresses theoretical commitments theory theory relates theories cognitive organization development . second section examines three domains knowledge evidence children 's changing theories . third section has neo - whorfian flavor addresses question different languages effect children 's theory-building . part 1 : theory theory section , g&m face head is certainly most difficult claims swallow , namely children 's early theories world are qualitatively same scientific theories subject revision same ways . while acknowledging are many differences between ways scientists infants operate , nevertheless maintain both construct same sorts theories same ways . theories both are abstract general , therefore provide means making predictions variety domains . both groups are concerned match theory world maintain theory long evidence supports . evidence mounts against theory , theory holder goes transitional state , actively seeking sorts evidence , conducting experiments developing technical vocabulary settle better theory . one g&m 's strong claims is standard adult theory ( so-called " folk-physics " " folk-psychology " , e . g . ) is principle open revision ; was developed response inadequate child theories world , , scientific theories , too revised , need arises . second chapter section compares theory theory two prominent cognitive models , modularity empirical generalizations ( e . g . , scripts , connectionism ) . g&m present theory theory substitute either models completely taking over roles each . thus , respect modularity , theory theory accounts many central cognitive processes less perceptually oriented modular processes ; respect empirical generalizations , theory theory is better equipped deal things causal linkages provide deeper level explanation general , generalizations still form important basis creation theories . part 2 : evidence theory theory part 2 consists three chapters each different knowledge domain show theory theory explain children 's development areas . chapter 4 deals children 's theories appearances addresses children 's development respect object permanence . chapter 5 takes children 's theories action causality animate inanimate things . chapter 5 addresses children 's developing theories natural kinds . each chapter discusses adult theory each domains looks marshals experimental evidence demonstrates infant 's initial theory looks subsequent revisions theory children . each domain , argue children crucial theory changes around ages 9 months again around age 18 months . g&m report results many experiments ( large number conducted g / m themselves ) amply illustrate children 's competence domains changes ( improves ) age . experimental evidence is times augmented anecdotal accounts infants affectively interact different tasks different ages . g&m are looking scientific behavior children is therefore important children pass tasks older ( theories better ) view tasks differently older . point examples emotional consternation infants show around theories are putatively changing . thus , 15 month old fail object has been secretly moved hiding place unperturbed failure ; 21 month old object place unimpressed own success . 18 month old , however , is both deeply disturbed fails ( structure task whole ) is joyful success . g&m argue affective differences reflect something blase-ness normal science compared eureka moments mark theory change . respect linguistics , one claims chapters is early utterances correspond technical vocabulary newly formed theories . g&m 's arguments are particularly intriguing respect performative utterances , " gone " " uhoh " are quite frequent speech 18 month olds been largely ignored language acquisition studies . claim , example , emergence word " gone " child speech is closely linked children 's ability solve invisible displacement task ( object is secretly moved hiding place ) . " gone " indicates object is sight reason , is effect technical term , reflecting concept infant 's theory . part 3 : language thought previous chapters , kinds evidence g&m suggested were driving theory formation revision arose primarily children 's interactions objects , actions world . chapter , g&m note language itself is part child 's world different languages principle provide different kinds evidence . since children 's theories are innately given are presumed constructed basis evidence world , different kinds linguistic evidence lead different theories , least different rates theory formation . support effects language theory building series longitudinal , crosslinguistic studies looking children acquiring korean english . cover experiments detail , gist appears korean is verb-centric while english is noun-centric linguistic difference translates korean children developing theories action quickly english counterparts , turn , develop theories natural kinds quickly korean children . evaluation despite fact theory theory informs active psychological research program , book is primarily book philosophy . thus , results large number experimental investigations are discussed one experiment is discussed sufficient detail critically evaluated . reader already acquainted cognitive developmental literature themselves somewhat confused ( perhaps somewhat unconvinced ) g&m are able draw conclusions experiments reported . problem might been remedied extent detailed explanations one two experiments act representative examples diagrams depicting sorts tasks used test infants . few diagrams / summary tables been helpful general . theory theory is dynamic form g&m trace two three theory changes within three different knowledge domains . critical point theory change comes through clearly , many details lost mass information ; summary table describing different theories ( perhaps evidence leads theory revision ) been useful reference . although g&m devote entire chapter persuading reader infant theory development scientific theory development are same , ultimately argument remains unconvincing insistence point throughout book has effect lessening force claims , rather strengthening . are many reasons skeptical link between two sets theory builders most compelling reason reject argument is seems grave injustice entrenchment our folk-scientific reasoning . nutshell , our adult folk-science is stable level knowledge , even principle , subject revision . g&m try argue against powerful intuition two ways . first , point fact science has moved beyond our folk theories , those theories can't word is true . while agree einsteinian physics is probably true ( . e . , better model world ) own folk-physics , ' m still stuck inadequate theory . g&m appeal division knowledge-labor claim theory really has changed societal level , highlights fact common person , our folk-science is unrevisable . g&m 's second argument our folk-science is open revision is imagine world require different theory , frequently invoke tv show star trek illustrating world . fantasy argument leaves entirely cold , partially strong intuitions ( g&m seem ) , example , status objects star trek transporter beam , partially believe are placing far heavy burden piece popular fiction . noted , however , rejecting most extreme g&m 's claims does fundamentally undermine arguments knowledge is organized around theories developmental change reflects changes children 's theories . even children 's theories are same type scientific theories , analyzing our knowledge terms kind theory children 's development form theory change is still intriguing compelling perspective . sum , g&m raised number extremely interesting questions nature knowledge representation , nature theories , nature cognitive development relationship language cognitive development . offer theory theory address questions , although one might believe theory theory actually has answers , is certainly important view debate . reviewed laura wagner , department psychology , university massachusetts - amherst . research centers children 's acquisition tense aspect .
