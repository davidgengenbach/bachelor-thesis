ecml-98 workshop : first call papers ecml-98 workshop : towards adaptive nlp - driven systems : linguistic information , learning methods applications organized : r . basili , m . t . pazienza ( university roma , tor vergata ) , italy since most applications , syntactic semantic , are lexicon driven , systematic reliable acquisition large scale linguistic information is real challenge natural language processing ( nlp ) . empiricist view natural language processing learning has become recently attractive wider research community : computational linguistics , artificial intelligence , psychology seemed converge specific data-oriented perspective aiming overcome traditional knowledge acquisition bottleneck . has been often noted limited attention paid machine learning community text speech data seems unjustified . is thus evident empirical learning natural language processing ( nlp ) alleviate nlp main problem means variety methods automatic induction lexical knowledge . lexical knowledge is often hard compile hand , even harder port reuse . nlp application systems still low impact real world problems , mainly due costs related reusability customization required lexicons . particular changes domain , causes changes lexical information required underlying natural language . empirical , symbolic machine learning methods perfectly suited task automatic acquisition adaptation klnowledge . rule induction , symbolic approaches clustering , lazy learning , inductive logic programming , been already proposed growing community is entering challenge theoretical ( . e . methodological ) application purposes variety techniques seems combined order successfully design realistic inductive systems text processing : target research are methodological design principles systems combining linguistic lexical learning capabilities large scale language processing tasks . is mean adaptive nlp - driven systems . within research enterprise , issues favour sinergistic process between nlp ml areas : access large data sets , are even increasing over , due telematics facilities available nowaday ; extending set typical classes ml problems hard cases ( particularly dense nlp processes ) ; adding inductive capabilities nlp system tasks related specific applications ( . e . information extraction ) . proposed workshop is thus aiming stimulate reasearch discussion following aspects : - establishing results evidencies suitability different ml paradigms specific levels representation lexical knowledge ( morphology , syntax , linguistic inference among others ) - comparison quantitative approaches lexical acquisition empirical symbolic methods - stimulating discussion cognitive perspective models within plausible architecture language processing learning - establishing results applicability extracted / induce knowledge within nlp systems , respect assessed evaluation criteria , typical ml language engineering ( le ) area - case studies adaptive nlp systems , . e . effective nlp systems integrating linguistic inferences inductive capabilities ( www kb cmu , ecran ) , - critical review existing experiences adaptive nlp systems - establishing guidelines evaluation framework adaptive nlp systems : accuracy linguistic process , robustness induction process , . . . - promote cooperation among research groups europe usa exchange ideas , data tools design experiment architectures adaptive nlp systems workshop format : workshop is expected cover whole day . first session , part invited talk , expect cover methodological issues . papers related advanced research suitability learning paradigms different target lexical information favoured . prototypical examples area are studies empirical learning tasks pos tagging , induction grammatical information , symbolic learning word sense disambiguation criteria lexical semantic information . panel discussion is expected close morning session focus principles suitability learning paradigms vs . lexical levels . second half day expect stimulate partecipants cover application areas , ir ie , couple invited talks existing adaptive systems basis presenting novel aspects integration nlp capabilities learning experience ( examples , errors , performance ) . set least 3 4 papers is expected concentrate original research works are currently under development several reasearch centres europe ( sheffield university , tilburg , rome tor vergata torino university ) . panel discussion implication adaptive paradigm existing potential nlp systems close workshop . program committee r . basili ( university roma , tor vergata , italy ) m . craven ( carnegie mellon university , usa ) w . daelemans ( university tilburg , nederlands ) m . t . pazienza ( university roma , tor vergata , italy ) l . saitta ( university torino , italy ) c . samuelssonn ( bell labs , at&t , usa ) y . wilks ( university sheffield , uk ) paper submission : = = = = = = = = = = = = papers exceed 3000 words 6 pages hard copy submission : three copies paper sent : roberto basili department computer science , systems production university roma , tor vergata via di tor vergata 00133 roma ( italy ) e-mail : basili @ info . utovrm . electronic submission : electronic submission either self-contained postscript rtf formats , basili @ info . utovrm . each submission - - whether hard copy electronic - - separate plain ascii text email message sent roberto basili , containing following information : # name : name first author # title : title paper # pages : number pages # files : name file ( attachments are submitted electronically ) # note : relevant instructions # keys : keywords # email : email first author # abstr : abstract paper . . . . . . timetable : workshop announcement call papers : 5 january 1998 papers due : 15 february 1998 notification acceptance : 5 march 1998 final version due : 25 march 1998 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - roberto basili department computer science , systems production university roma , tor vergata via di tor vergata 00133 roma ( italy ) e-mail : basili @ info . utovrm . tel : + 39 - 6 - 7259 7391 fax : + 39 - 6 - 7259 7460 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
