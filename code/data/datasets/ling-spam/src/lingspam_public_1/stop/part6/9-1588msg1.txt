silverman , daniel . ( 1997 ) . phasing recoverability . outstanding dissertations linguistics series . york : garland publishing . 242 pages . reviewed stefan frisch , university michigan . book is revised version author 's 1995 ucla dissertation . primary thesis defended silverman is auditory salience plays important role explaining typology phonological segment inventories . relative phasing laryngeal supralaryngeal gestures is examined case study . silverman demonstrates is typological preference phasing patterns gestures are optimally recoverable . further , proposes sub-optimal patterns are found inventories where optimal patterns are present . ( note silverman does crucially adopt segment phonological primitive . is concerned primarily gestures realization system syntagmatic contrasts . terms 's egment ' 's egment inventory ' are used expository convenience . ) synopsis : chapter 1 . introduction chapter introduces primary thesis : cross - linguistically , laryngeal supralaryngeal gestures are phased values maximally auditorily salient . silverman argues parallel production contrastive gestures is informationally optimal , those gestures are auditorily recoverable . cases where parallel production contrastive values unrecoverable , gestures are serially sequenced . example , aspirated stops , laryngeal abduction is sequences follow stop closure , resulting broadband noise . laryngeal abduction stop closure were simultaneous , state larynx recoverable resulting acoustic signal ( silence ) . silverman introduces ' gestural score ' notation articulatory phonology ( browman & goldstein , 1986 ) used description gestural patterns . each gestural score is accompanied set temporally aligned descriptions acoustic cues highlight importance recoverability gestures . resulting segmental percept is given , highlight whether contrastive segmental information has been effectively transmitted . using notation , exemplifies four logically possible phasing patterns : parallel , sequenced , expanded , truncated . parallel phasing pattern , two gestures are phased fully simultaneous . sequenced pattern , two gestures are serially ordered . expanded pattern , one gesture both begins before ends after another . truncated pattern , one gesture is phased simultaneous portion ( beginning end ) another gesture . chapter 2 . previous work chapter , silverman reviews previous research articulatory timing , auditory response acoustic signals , relevance auditory contrastiveness segmental inventories . two results are particular importance . first , combination auditory factors favor patterns where low intensity signals are followed high intensity signals . second , languages employ contrasts are maximally auditorily distinct . chapter 3 . obstruents laryngeal gestures chapter contains typological evidence support silverman 's thesis . cross - linguistically , laryngeal gestures abduction constriction are overwhelmingly phased follow supralaryngeal constriction , maximizes recoverability both gestures . sub-optimal pattern , where laryngeal gesture precedes stop release is found optimal pattern is present . obstruents , minimum acoustic energy work , are two phasing patterns . chapter 4 . sonorants laryngeal gestures sonorants greater amount acoustic energy , laryngeal gestures overlap supralaryngeal gestures . most attested pattern , languages laryngeal contrast sonorants , is laryngeal gesture truncated beginning portion supralaryngeal gesture . parallel obstruent case , phasing pattern puts low-energy breathy glottalized portion sonorant before high-energy modally-voiced portion , maximizing auditory salience . again , less optimal pattern truncates laryngeal gesture latter portion supralaryngeal gesture . ordinarily , laryngeal supralaryngeal gestures are completely overlapped , contrastive supralaryngeal gestures ( nasal place articulation , example ) rendered non - recoverable . however , interesting special case is found laterals . due formant structure laterals , languages generally contrasts place articulation . thus , cases ( e . g . zulu ) , contrastive laryngeal gestures are realized fully parallel supralaryngeal gesture . similar pattern is found coda nasals comaltapec chinantec , where place articulation is contextually determined . contrast onset nasals , contrastive place articulation , laryngeal abduction is realized parallel supralaryngeal gesture coda nasals contrasts are lost . chapter 5 . vowels laryngeal gestures chapter , vowels contrastive laryngeal gestures are discussed . silverman claims , since vowels abundance acoustic energy , laryngeal gestures implemented parallel supralaryngeal gestures without loss auditory contrast . however , pattern is auditorily least optimal . sonorant case , optimal pattern is laryngeal gesture truncated beginning portion vowel , resulting ? v hv sequences . less optimal is opposite phasing pattern , resulting v ? vh . typologically hv is indeed much prevalent voiceless vowels vh ( similarly laryngeal constriction ) . bulk chapter ( book ) is devoted ' laryngeally complex ' vowels otomanguean languages . term larygeally complex is used vowels realize both contrastive phonation ( breathy creaky ) tone . one example , comaltapec chinantec , has eight vowel qualities five tonal qualities two voice qualities . addition , language has nasalization length contrast leads 320 possible realizations nucleus . surprisingly , words language are generally monosyllabic , nucleus quality is used differentiate many lexical contrasts . silverman argues simultaneous realization breathiness / creakiness tone render tone contrasts unrecoverable . cross-linguistically prevalent pattern is laryngeal contrast truncated beginning vowel , is auditorily optimal . tone is saliently realized during modal phonation latter portion vowel . opposite sequencing , laryngeal after tonal contrast ( modal phonation ) is attested . silverman finds two cases where tonal laryngeal contrasts are executed simultaneously ( tibeto - burman languages mpi tamang ) . one those cases , are two tones , tonal contrasts much danger , tones distinct case comaltapec chinantec , eight tones . critical evaluation : overall , is inspirational volume demonstrating importance auditory / phonetic explanation phonological patterning . is one first series ucla dissertations topic , together address wide range phonological phenomena . silverman 's analysis bridges phonetics / phonology gap number ways . example , arbitrary number phasing differences , might dismissed ' phonetic implementation ' , are shown reducible small set phonologically contrastive . reduction , via abstract temporal relationships simultaneity precedence , nicely complements work speech perception cross-linguistic ( cross-species ) robustness categorical perception voice onset continua ( kuhl & miller , 1975 ; pisoni , 1977 ) . credit , book contains over dozen reasonably detailed case studies realization laryngeal contrasts different languages . many cases , recordings were available presence phasing relationships were verified , spectrograms appropriate examples are given . case studies often address potential counterexamples silverman 's typological claims . example , mon - khmer language chong possesses coda stops contrastive creakiness , creakiness is realized non-optimal pre-glottalized stop . chong case , however , aspects morphophonology require non-optimal realization avoid loss contrast . particular , coda stops are obligatorily unreleased , language is non-suffixing . due additional constraints , post-glottalized phasing saliently encode larygneal contrast . type constraint interaction is quite compatible general approach optimality theory ( prince & smolensky , 1993 ) , fact original version dissertation presented constraint tableau cases . proposed constraints are quite broad were informally described , optimality theoretic analysis did add exposition , book reads easily without . despite lack formalist analysis , book raises number issues are relevant current formal concerns . otomanguean language copala trique are different phasing relationships between vocalic laryngeal gestures . laryngeal gestures ( breathiness creakiness ) truncated first portion vowel , second portion vowel , ' interrupt ' vowel , appearing middle . three locations laryngeal gesture support lexical contrasts , is clear evidence interrupted vowels are monosyllabic . encoding three configurations using abstract representations articulatory phonology is trivial task . addition , correspondence theory approach faithfulness considers segmentally aligned ordered input output ( mccarthy & prince , 1995 ) . presence relatively small contrastive differences phasing require subsegmental correspondence relations between input output . another missing aspect optimality theoretic analysis factorial typology constraint interactions . while silverman 's coverage is quite extensive , interested seeing discussion pros cons each logical possibility phasing between laryngeal supralaryngeal gestures . discussion eventually needed order determine whether silverman 's proposal is is truly predictive , informally defined extent observed pattern explained . few instances , silverman makes upsid database segmental inventories ( maddieson , 1986 ) demonstrate typological predictions are satisfied . unfortunately , quantitative differences are reported most cases . while sufficient data available , quantitative analysis is desirable order address current question work phonetic explanation phonological patterns : are non-optimal patterns avoided degree are non-optimal ? words , is hypothesized functional force auditory recoverability transparently reflected patterns within across languages , is ' phonologized ' language learner is quantitative relationship ? answer question has implications architecture phonetically grounded grammar , quantitative constraints quantitative constraint rankings required . book touches number important issues topics ongoing research . central role recoverability contrasts leads inevitably question : is contrast ? assuming psychological reality segment provides simple answer , one is entirely correct . three contrastive phasing relationships copala trique are amenable segmental analysis . chong , combination coda unrelease lack suffixation is claimed lead pre-glottalized stops . case is contrasted korean , where is suffixation , post-glottalized stops are maintained environment neutralized elsewhere . wonder frequent neutralizing environment must before non-optimal pattern becomes necessary contrast is lost ? why is n't laryngeal gesture phased before stop closure neutralizing environment , after non-neutralizing environment ? perhaps constraint is involved here . many case studies given , simple syllable structure monosyllabic tendencies languages are mentioned reasons why complex non-optimal phasing relations are found ( most cases , optimal recoverability supralaryngeal gestures is found contrastive laryngeal gestures are used ) . suggests is minimal set contrasts required create sufficient number open class items language useful communication system , differences syllable structure , word length , segmental inventory size interact fashion end . answers deeper questions appear closer our understanding phonological system is conceptualized implied book , combinatorial system articulatory / acoustic contrasts highly constrained variety functional factors . references : browman , c . p . & goldstein , l .
