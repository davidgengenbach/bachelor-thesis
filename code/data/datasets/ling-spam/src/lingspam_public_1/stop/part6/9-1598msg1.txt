Subject: review : scobbie : autosegmental representation

scobbie , james m . ( 1997 ) autosegmental representation declarative constraint - based framework , garland press , york . [ revision 1991 phd dissertation , university edinburgh ] [ * ] michael hammond university arizona jim scobbie 's dissertation , recently published outstanding dissertations linguistics series through garland press , is excellent example pre - optimality - theory attempt constraint-based phonology has received insufficient attention phonological community . is extremely unfortunate , thesis makes number interesting proposals are worth considering today . dissertation is usual vein american phonology theses . 's in-depth analysis particular array data . rather , appears fit much european template , attention paid placing author 's proposal context previous ideas . despite different approach , is much recommend . general hypothesis pursued is phonological generalizations representations are best cast attribute-value structures . formal devices are drawn hpsg ( head - driven phrase - structure grammar ) literature ( pollard & sag , 1987 ) . basic idea is dominance is expressed something roughly equivalent featural distinction . example , standard phonological representation fact vowel might high is expressed assigning vowel ' + ' feature [ high ] , e . g . [ + high ] . expressed attribute-value formalism , attribute [ high ] has value ' + ' . hpsg goes one step further encodes dominance same fashion . thus , fact syllable has [ + high ] nucleus is expressed positing nucleus attribute syllable element allowing nucleus attribute itself [ + high ] attribute-value pair . ( 1 ) formal object above denotes syllable [ + high ] nucleus . ( ' ve indicated irrelevant information ellipses . ) context representations , scobbie 's central claim is autosegmental association formalized dominance attribute-value structure . phonological representations encode linear order , scobbie 's theory , linear order is formalized root nodes ( is indicated indices ) . string segments represented set indexed root matrices , essentially following sort . ( 2 ) indices are ordered relation immediate precedence ' ' . [ 1 ] structures , scobbie goes further suggests phonological rules traded constraints . constraints , suggests , are formally indistinct representations apply . ( rather similar position has been advanced ot . russell , 1995 hammond , appear . ) example , generalization excluding mid nasal vowels expressed follows . ( 3 ) expression rules element is simultaneously specified [ - low ] , [ - high ] , [ + nasal ] . constraints n't actually " apply " representations . rather , scobbie proposes , constraints are unified representations . unification allows representations meld , long n't conflict . example , representation consisting solely ifferent elements . example , index variables below indicate two matrices share token value , merely share type value b . ( 6 ) scobbie develops formalism number ways . first , argues representations one above are subject calls sharing constraint ( p . 93 ) . ( 7 ) sharing constraint structure is dominated two paths type p indices j , where , every index n where is path dominating m . immediate effect is rule cases where noncontiguous root elements share token value . scobbie argues evidence cases is weak . ( cf . similar proposal archangeli & pulleyblank , 1994 . ) interesting consequence is scobbie uses constraint attempt derive - crossing constraint ( ncc ) , part goldsmith 's ( 1976 ) general - formedness condition autosegmental representations . is constraint rules crossing autosegmental association lines . sagey ( 1986 ; 1988 ) first proposes derive ncc treatment autosegmental association overlap . however , hammond ( 1988 ) argues notion is formally problematic proposing different characterization association transitive , irreflexive , asymmetric relation . hammond 's approach , however , does derive ncc without stipulation . scobbie 's approach involves asymmetric characterization association ( dominance ) , does derive ncc . scobbie 's derivation ncc is based assumption are contour values . is , while two different root nodes might share value token second picture below , one root node cannot bear two different values , first picture below ( where " s " indicates segment root node " t " indicates tone value token ) . ( 8 ) is necessary position given formalization sequencing : root nodes bear index linear position ; nonroot tokens are unsequenced . ( similar position is developed heiberg , prep . ) were contour values allowed , distinguish ordering . hand , two root nodes share value , ordering is distinguished terms indices , ( 6 ) . upshot prohibition contours is violations ncc arise is independent sharing violation . is , ncc violations ( 9 ) , ( 9 ) necessarily includes sharing violation . ( 9 ) is nice result , comes cost ) ruling discontinuous association , ii ) excluding contour values . scobbie argues approach allows derive phenomenon geminate integrity ( hayes , 1986 ; schein & steriade , 1986 ) . basic idea geminate integrity is geminates resist epenthesis . ( guerssel , 1977 ; 1978 early treatment suh , 1997 recent proposal . ) standard account is geminates resist epenthesis result entail crossing association lines , violation ncc , ( 9 ) above . problem , noted scobbie others , is epenthetic vowel is featureless ( 10 ) inserted another tier ( 11 ) , violation ncc occurs . ( 10 ) ( 11 ) scobbie 's own proposal is simple direct . epenthesis geminate structure results violation sharing , regardless whether epenthetic vowel has features whether features might appear tier . scobbie goes consider possibility geminate inalterability might follow sharing constraint , here proposal is lot speculative . basic idea pursued is geminate inalterability results default rules . problem is scobbie does n't really offer clear proposal nature default rules . face , seem glaring problem monotonic theory proposes . final substantive chapter , scobbie treats problem long-distance association , , e . g . arabic verbal morphology . offers well-taken criticisms traditional autosegmental approach , does really offer explicit declarative counterproposal . sum , book is worth reading . offers interesting alternative constraint-based view phonology much recommend . hand , are number unresolved questions . floating segments ? scobbie speculates , offers satisfying solution . noted above , contour segments are ruled , though evidence tonal domain is unimpeachable .
