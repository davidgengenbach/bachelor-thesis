( 1997 ) rightward movement ( linguistik aktuell 17 ) amsterdam : benjamins . 406 pp . is proceedings volume collecting together papers presented oct . 1995 tilburg conference rightward movement . editors mention two three papers were presented conference were including proceedings volume . ` two three ' , although mention three authors ( kayne , koike , truckenbrodt ) , koike actually has paper volume ; why name is included list authors whose papers were included . back book , complete list addresses ( snail - e-mail ) contributors is included . editors ' preface ( van riemsdijk named principal author ) provides nice summary relevant issues background literature . special note is taken repercussions recent work minimalist program ( e . g . , kayne 1994 ) whole notion ` rightward movement ' ( hereafter rm ) . reviewer note particular , although is commonly supposed , stated preface , ` minimalist approach , movement is exclusively triggered checking . . . . given line thinking , rightward movement simply cannot triggered , hence cannot exist ' , contributors - - e . g . , alphonce & davis , buring & hartmann - - demonstrate is fact possible develop hypotheses within minimalist framework enable triggering movement . 14 papers collection , is hardly surprising 7 deal ` extraposition ' ( defined various ways ) , four those are concerned primarily one aspect extraposition german . discuss extraposition papers group before considering others . josef bayer 's paper ` cp - extraposition argument shift ' ( pp . 37-58 ) begins nice , neat summary problems classical extraposition account ( via rm ) postverbal cps v - final languages ( focussing particularly bengali , hindi , german ) , noting problems disappear under kayne - type analysis . however , goes note definite empirical problems kayne - type analysis . proposes analysis according complement is right-adjoined maximal projection governing head ( case vp ) , leaving behind trace sole sister head ( v ) . trace is deleted tree is pruned , v ends complement right theta-mark . alternatively , bayer suggests , least ` extraposed ' cps base-generated right , co-indexed ( dummy / deletable ) pronominal , inheritance are licensed . bayer notes help account fact ov languages ( e . g . , bengali ) , certain classes cps are * always * ` extraposed ' . assume directionality is relevant selection , resulting vp constitutes barrier cp ` non-canonical ' side head , account scope effects bayer notes earlier being problematic both traditional account kayne - type account . ` rightward scrambling ' ( pp . 186-214 ) , anoop mahajan argues basis various relations sensitive c-command postverbal nominal arguments hindi are merely constituents left behind while everything else has moved leftwards . analysis supersedes rm analysis proposed unpublished paper ten years ago is deliberately consistent analysis based kayne 's linear correspondence axiom ( hereafter lca ) . reviewer notes many mahajan 's arguments necessarily presuppose certain possibly dubious tacit assumptions , e . g . , rm must necessarily involve adjunction specifically ip ( contrary approach proposed , e . g . , muller 's , wiltschko 's , rochemont & culicover 's papers ) . instance , string mahajan 's ( 33 ) , marks ( ? ? ? ) generated - - unacceptability accounted - - right-adjunction direct object vp rather ip . nowhere does mahajan actually address reviewer 's opinion is most basic issue questions : is is evidence * gap * corresponding postverbal material ? michael s . rochemont & peter w . culicover ` deriving dependent right adjuncts english ' ( pp . 279-300 ) discuss various constructions english , might included under rather broadly-defined concept ` extraposition ' . distinguishing between extraposition relative clauses one hand heavy - np shift presentational - insertion , argue relative - clause extraposition is best treated ( 1 ) base - generated ( 2 ) right-adjunction governing category ( vp , ip , cp ) antecedent extraposed rc . effort conjure plausible analyses rc - extraposition involving kayne - style leftward-movement note none possibilities consider are quite satisfactory . even ` best ' option , involving movement both rc antecedent distinct spec positions , fails provide motivation either posited movement highly ramified structure analysis requires . expanding earlier work own ( rochemont & culicover 1990 ) , rochemont & culicover argue heavy - np shift presentational - insertion are best treated instances movement right - adjoined ' - position . demonstrate , quite apart problems discussed rochemont & culicover 1990 , attempt analyze constructions means exclusively leftward movement involves extremely unattractive movement is , fact , stretch imagination recognizable constituent . end , acknowledge are empirical problems shared both rightward-movement account apparently prefer ` movement high specifier ' account consistent kayne - type approach , latter raises provoking theoretical problems are absent rightward-movement account . conclude saying ` question whether rightward movement exists . . . is empirical one . ' daniel buring & katharina hartmann 's paper ` kayne mutiny ' ( pp . 59-80 ) presents excellent argument empirical bankruptcy kayne antisymmetry hypothesis . making crucial reconstruction lf binding - theoretic statements referring ( undeleted ) traces , b&h 's argument is built upon prediction , extraposition is consequence rm , ought possible proper binding relation * * exist between np cp later sentence - - np happens hierarchically lower position , neither nor daughters is able c-command cp ( lack binding relation is priori impossible kayne analysis , according np left cp must ipso facto c-command ) . demonstrate binding failures are fact attested , are indeed difficult language german . ( end section 2 , acknowledge confusing results regard coreference options , concluding ` require further investigation ' . ) further demonstrate ( section 3 ) kayne analysis actually does serious violence many standard assumptions movement , including ( similarly rochemont & culicover ) issues qualifies ( movable ) constituent under circumstances constituent ` stranded ' . ( 's surreptitiously iconoclastic character kayne 's hypothesis clever title . ) demonstrate verb - topicalization ought impossible kayne analysis , although course 's quite common german . order account complications regard island - constraint violations , etc . presented problems earlier versions rm - analysis extraposition german similar languages , b&h propose ( p . 72 ) generalization according finite clauses never governed either v . provides actual motivation cp - extraposition , since presumably ds position complement clause is governed matrix verb , order escape government must right-adjoined higher phrasal node , presumably ip . is direct conflict bayer 's analysis , according extraposed cp ends being governed matrix verb result deletion own trace tree-pruning ; analysis is preferred ought empirical problem . hubert haider 's paper ` extraposition ' ( 115-152 ) argues basis extraposition comparatives c-command relations essential thereto english german ( mostly german ) extraposed constituents remain embedded ds mothers . haider further argues extraposed relative argument clauses must vp - internal , since although are n't subject same c-command relations themselves , always * before * extraposed comparatives are . broadening scope section 2 examples german extraposition , haider demonstrates can't result movement must therefore base-generated . , basis scope , c-command , absence island-effects , argues against analysis terms base-generated adjunction . haider agrees kayne assuming exclusive leftward movement ; however , allows either head-initial head-final base structures , invokes head movement while kayne invokes phrasal movement . haider presents several predictions kayne 's lca theory language german , demonstrates are falsified actual data : ( 1 ) phrases left verb spec - positions , therefore islands ( 2 ) vp - adverbials predicates end postverbal position , since 's nothing trigger movement ( 3 ) vp - topicalization ought involve movement functional projection containing trace finite verb . ` extraposition remnant movement ' ( p . 215-246 ) , gereon muller offers neat analysis extraposition german right - adjunction variety phrasal nodes , including cp vp ip , thereby accounting various otherwise problematic details regard island effects both leftward - rightward-moved constituents . paper includes interesting useful comparative discussion adequacy variety different proposed constraints excluding unacceptable strings while allowing acceptable ones . martina wiltschko 's paper , ` extraposition , identification precedence ' ( pp . 358-396 ) , summary 1995 wien dissertation , discusses extraposition german , focussing relation * identification * between ` identifyee ' , ( pro ) nominal element ( np dp ) canonical position within clause ` identifier ' , extraposed constituent . both identifyee identifier provide linguistically necessary information : identifyee occupies canonical ( theta - ) position , therefore satisfying syntactic requirements , while identifier provides necessary semantic content licence identifyee 's definiteness . given identifyee * introduces * discourse referent , must ( basis heim 's ( 1980 ) novelty condition ) precede identifier . wiltschko argues locality constraint identification , according identifier must c-command identifyee , without intervening xp ; thus , identifier must right-adjoined minimal maximal projection dominating identifyee . wiltschko 's view , two constraints together account fact identifiers are always extraposed . acknowledges analysis apply * restrictive relative clauses * , types modifiers . attractive paper is many ways , suffers somewhat necessary exclusion many supporting arguments , interested reader is referred full-length dissertation . two papers are concerned primarily parsing theory development adequate parsing technology . both papers , coming different points view , argue data-driven , bottom-up parsing strategy against hypothesis-driven top-down strategy . ` movement one - pass backtrack parsing ' ( pp . 301-330 ) , chris sijtsma recognizes ` natural ' ( . e . , single-pass , backtracking , faithful derivation ) bottom-up parsers are less restrictive natural top-down parsers , course point view strict generative theory is point against , assumes is enough variation among actual languages bottom-up parsing strategy is preferred . reviewer finds conclusion attractive , worries sijtsma has provided little empirical demonstration back ; indeed , mathematically-oriented paper ( least relative reviewer 's experience ) , is extremely little solid argument presented ; most , sijtsma merely asserts proof given theorem is either self-evident readily derivable ; few cases , refers demonstrations elsewhere literature . another issue both papers consider seriously , without , however , either coming satisfactory solution , is proper size - ahead window adequate parser . sijtsma asserts ( pp . 305 - 6 ) grammar look-ahead window greater 1 is functionally equivalent grammar looks ahead one symbol , goes , ` practice still need . . . parsers ahead one symbol . ' subsequent discussion becomes clear is unclear large - ahead window is empirically adequate . likewise , alphonce & davis , while currently working look-ahead window ` most two chunks ' ( p . 25 ) , are clearly dissatisfied characterization . is clear issue needs thought , further research , devoted . fundamental claim paper carl alphonce & henry davis , ` motivating non - directional movement ' ( pp . 7-36 ) , is linear precedence constraints , indeed lp phenomena kind , relevance syntax ; essentially , claim , point view syntactic levels including lf , constituents are organized hierarchically terms dominance relations linearly terms precedence relations . alphonce & davis ' view , precedence relations are imposed pf , making essentially matters performance rather competence . opinion reviewer , is interesting possibly attractive idea . unfortunately , contrary promise contained abstract , claim is much argued assumed within paper . nor is made clear - - reviewer , anyway - - is explicitly argued anywhere else , unlike skipped arguments behind wiltschko 's paper citations given sijtsma 's paper . alphonce & davis merely demonstrate is possible develop analytic approach - - precisely , parsing program - - has need kind explicit syntactic constraints , level ( whether ug language-particular ) , making reference linear order . end abstract , alphonce & davis claim are motivated conviction ` is priori desirable eliminate much redundancy possible between different components system . . . . phenomena has [ sic ] independent processing explanation hold syntactic theory offer explanation .
