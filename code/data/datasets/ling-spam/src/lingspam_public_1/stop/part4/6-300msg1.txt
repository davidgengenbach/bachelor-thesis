Subject: sum : function words

. question motivation three weeks ago , asked linguist readers help examples function words unusually specific meanings . was meant elicit examples mention paper called " formal semantics grammaticalization " , where discuss happens meaning content morpheme develops function morpheme . argue , developing work semanticists / logicians , ( 1 ) function morphemes meanings ( contrary widespread assumption ) . consider meanings quantifiers , tense , aspect , modals , etc . are bread butter us working semanticists . ( 2 ) is class " logical " meanings certain formal properties ( permutation-invariance , high types ) . ( 3 ) unfortunately , is perfect correlation between logical meanings functional morphemes . are lexical / content morphemes ( almost ) logical meanings ( adjectives " same " , " mere " , " alleged " , verbs " deny " , " believe " , nouns " majority " , etc . ) . might functional morphemes non-logical meanings ( hence linguist query ) . ( 4 ) thus is much happens meaning morpheme is becoming grammaticalized . although presumably doomed efforts . finished paper ( is based talk gave nels 25 workshop language change ) appear nels 25 proceedings ( available glsa umass amherst , glsa @ linguist . umass . edu ) . paper is downloadable anonymous ftp following url : ftp : / / broca . mit . edu / pub / fintel / gramma . ps welcome comments . ii . responses : mark robert hale ( hale1 @ alcor . concordia . ca ) wrote : ) reference [ pejorative pronouns " shit " ] ) is samuel elbert 's grammar ) rennellese / bellona , " echo culture : grammar ) rennell bellona " , uhawaii press 1988 ) [ oceanic linguistics special publication . 22 ] . ) ) few interesting cases ) grammaticalization somewhat relevant ) type exist . micronesian languages ) are set verbal affixes ) directionality ( , down , towards speaker , ) towards hearer , towards third ) party [ usual deixis system ] ) ) include " toward open ocean " ) " toward lagoon " ; whereas ( course ) ) want " toward john 's house " ) ( nonce collocation ) ) need pp . ) ) similar , probably similar enough , ) is bizarre cardinal directionals ) icelandic documented classic paper ) einar haugen ( dig reference ) really want ) . seems , being ) predominantly coastal inhabitants , having ) rather uneven fjorded coastline , ) city was north actually ) involved heading southerly ) direction ( ) .
