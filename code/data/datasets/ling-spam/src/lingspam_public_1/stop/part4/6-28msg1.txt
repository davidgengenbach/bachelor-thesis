( 2 ) why are gardners , savage - rumbaugh , chadwick , etc . irritated us ? first question , respondents , david pesetsky , seem agreed most impressive ' linguistic ' performance chimps gorillas reported literature is level roughly equi - valent human child approximately two years age , anthropoids seem unable develop beyond stage . particular , show evidence syntactic structure , nor ability distance themselves temporally spatially referents statements . received statements following : ' most successful apes managed reach less level children two-word utterance stage . size lexi - con is same , is combinatory ability . ' ' apes master refined system communication , are capable abstract thinking , lack fundamentals human language ( recursiveness , structure-dependency , parsing constituents , etc . ) . ' ' chimps mostly lexicon , rudimentary syntax lets distinguish between actor patient , 's . . . . chimps ( ) morphology speak ( b ) can't displacement message ( . e . , can't talk past future , something happens / ed another location ) ' [ venture , guess can't handle contrafactuals either . ] ' is claimed ape " utterances " lack grammaticality syntax . apes correct symbolic associations , sense grammatical patterning . two three " word " sentences , order elements is variable each element maybe repeated number times order independently rest ( sequences banana kanzi kanzi banana kanzi , etc . ) ' one respondents , partly basis hanns own occasionally frus - trating experiences resulting geographical proximity insti - tution presumably devoted 's tudy ' anthropoid language , made critical statements scientific methodology research . particular , after referring hockett 's 16 'd esign fea - tures ' language , hann remarks : ' proponents ' claim [ chimps ] cultural transmission , washo taught son , does n't bear under much scrutiny ; washo had rewarded learn every sign son has learned many , nor passed chimp . chimps learned equivalent pidgin ; creoliza - tion never took place . ' implies ( 1 ) anthropoid ' language ' ac - tually corresponds skinnerian model refuted chomsky fa - mous review regards human language ( 2 ) is sufficiently ' natural ' anthropoids feel motivated transmit successfully . respondents addressed wider theoretical metho - dological issues relevant linguistics implicit discussion . one opined ' dismissal ape language research is partly , unconsciously , motivated turf-protection instinct . ' re alrea - dy uneasy fact are certain subfields linguistics whose importance acknowledge ' re personally terribly well-versed . . . . many theoretical linguists breathed sigh relief terrace announced [ chimp ] nim had n't really learned human language . meant did n't worry mo - difying theories fit ape language data . ' another said , ' most linguists n't really care ( least consciously ) whether apes learn language , care deeply whether lan - guage is " sui generis " innate . . . . far linguists are concerned , ' re divided over chomsky 's claim language is geneti - cally-programmed module , rather area knowledge is han - dled general cognition . apes can't learn language , supports chomskyan view ( presumably involves cataclysmic mutation 100 , 000 years ago , least since split off primates ) . learn , evidence ge - neral cognition ( where apes are presumably less endowed us , 'd expect partial success ) . ' further discussion agreed argument held accept 's trong ' version relevant dichotomy implicit innateness hypothesis , according human linguistic ability is overwhelmingly completely independent general human cognition . pointed even chimps are demonstrably distinct us genetic level still share over 98 % our dna . even share our linguistic ability might mean share distinc - tive genetic endowment provides . effective test cetaceans pachyderms , are nowhere nearly related us chimps are appear roughly comparable cognitive levels . share certain amount our linguistic ability , indicate least amount is probably dependent general cognitive ability specific genetic endowment . chimps , dolphins , elephants , whatever , can't master human language modes communication * isomorphic * ours * comparable com - plexity flexibility * , us opportunity stu - dy much human language is necessary general phenomenon language much is incidental relevance our species ; might enable us talk ' innateness ' human linguistic ability terms offputting geneticists . second question , basis irritation towards academic lin - guists part proponents anthropoid language , was consensus were working overly simplistic concep - tion constitutes language , were offended refused share . typical were following remarks : ' [ proponents ] animal language , continuity hu - man language , assume human natural languages simply * are * result communication . . . . basic design human languages is * * dictated , easily conceive species possess * radically * different design language communicate , better .
