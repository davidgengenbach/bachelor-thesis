Subject: ipa vs americanist symbols

am drawn reply debate ipa versus ' americanist ' traditions phonetic transcription . was , frankly , somewhat surprised tone original submission , suggesting ipa 's refusal hachek / wedge symbols palatoalveolars was example racism ( both anti - americanism anti-slavicism , doubt anti - diacriticism ) . learn ipa itself is anti-democratic conspiracy , need campaign led american organisations phonetic transcription 's afe democracy , apple pie , american ' ! ? couple points need made regard , . first , is true ipa is used north america . here is maybe euro - centrism , phonology / dialectology centrism ! clinical phoneticians speech pathologists north american nearly always ipa ( yes : long esses / zees , jods , cardinal vowel system , ! ) indeed , departments linguistics / phonetics operate within ipa tradition ( e . g . university victoria bc ) . hand , virtually phonologists side atlantic so-called americanist symbols . divide , therefore , is has been portrayed . phonologists tend one set symbols , phoneticians another , is really problem , often are concerned different levels description anyway ? even phoneticians cannot agree , is problem ? raising fears racial discrimination undemocratic conspiracies really justified over relatively trivial distinctions symbols anyone trained area knows anyway ? second point concerns debate symbols themselves . noted , difference between certain symbols is surely fundamentally important one ; speak defence ipa non-hachek versions . leaving aside fact symbols long history , ( ) feel unit symbol is preferably composite one . ( unlike original posting , always seemed obvious hachek symbols were s / z etc plus diacritic ) . granted ipa is always consistent point , unitary symbol approach avoids confusions nature s - s distinction . one counter students ' feelings [ s ] is really type [ s ] is reinforced spelling ; does n't help symbol looks 's ort s ' . might difference [ j ] versus [ y ] palatal approximant . surface , looks fine , [ y ] spelling is familiar ( surely anglocentric , line slavic / germanic etc usage ? ) . however , choice leaves us problem high front rounded vowel . can't [ y ] must resort [ u " ] . diacritic [ " ] , however , is commonly used many traditions stand centralized . transcription suggests [ u " ] is variety [ u ] , [ o " ] is variety [ o ] etc . independent symbols leaves open relationship between lip-rounding tongue position , 'd iaresis ' versions . however phonetic transcription develops future , let 's avoid throwing around accusations users bodies . utopian schemes universal orthodoxy area are surely unneccessary unsound . realistic , most ipa users ( wherever ' re based ) are unlikely surrender over century 's worth patterns usage , non - ipa users equally keen keep symbolizations . let 's learn live , spend instead refining transcription systems ( e . g . transcription atypical speech found speech pathology clinics ) . perhaps , vive la difference is motto aspire ! martin j . ball university ulster
