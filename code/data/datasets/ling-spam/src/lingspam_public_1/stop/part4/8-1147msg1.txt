class processes floundered was done . information communication systems either amplify reduce magnitude differences across culture engineering discipline . researchers specializing knowledge representation , modelling , communications , standardization , reuse invited share experiences research perspectives . - enterprise data sharing across engineering , cultural , supply chain boundaries , - distributed manufacturing supply chain management - early stage product development dynamically incorporates supplier constraints - standard models component information representation , product process interchange , - technologies knowledge sharing , collaboration , across product lifecycle , - adaptive systems organizational management , knowledge sharing , education , training - organizational manufacturing process simulation - organizing representing design manufacturing process dissemination reuse - interface between human machine information sharing , training , education , - virtual reality multi-media manufacturing design - collaborative manufacturing process definition operation - collaborative product process modeling product life cycle - implications models human communication support integrated manufacturing _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ track 3 : telecommunication agility impact software technology -
