review : arboreal windows , cascadilla press . dr . matthew crocker ( mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk ) centre cognitive science , university edinburgh . arboreal windows ( henceforth , arborwin ) is package designed facilitate drawing trees within microsoft ( tm ) windows ( tm ) applications . arborwin consists simply truetype ( tm ) font keys are mapped tree component shaped characters rather standard keyboard symbols . advantage drawing trees is arborwin is portable , used wysiwyg windows ( tm ) application allows select specific fonts ( . e . most ) . disadvantage , broadly , is ` type-setting ' layout trees is left user . ` characters ' arborwin include left , right , vertical , ` triangle ' branches - - each several widths ( same height ) . font is fully scalable . general , found arborwin behaved intended , given is simply font-based package . most basic limitation is is relatively small selection branch sizes ( . e . narrow wide branch is ) . practice , most common problem encountered was ` triangle ' branches ( eg , phrase without internal structure ) n't made wide enough . . . given one often wants put fairly long phrases under . increase width was increase point size branch ; increases height particular branch , makes trees disproportionate inconsistent . being font-based , however , means cannot attain flexibility alternative packages ( eg , ` tree ' package latex ) . ' tree ' package , example , takes input declarative tree specification ( bracketed list ) automatically typesets tree , permits crossing branches , upside-down trees . since typesetting is automatic , tree formatting is consistent , tailored size / length terminals ( including triangle branches ) . overall package is simple quite effective requirements ( terms both sophistication , layout quality ) are too demanding . greater flexibility , consistency , quality is required , believe is still substitute latex associated packages . dr . matthew crocker , esrc research fellow centre cognitive science university edinburgh mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk
