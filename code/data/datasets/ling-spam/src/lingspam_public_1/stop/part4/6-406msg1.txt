aim colloquium is broad many important issues relating machine intelligence world accessible most recent research integrating information different modalities . example , why is important symbol representation grounding is role emerging neural network technology ? one approach has been link intelligence sensory world through visual systems robotic devices . another approach is work systems integrate information different modalities vision language . yet another approach has been examine human brain relates sensory , motor information . looks long getting handle age old chinese room symbol grounding problems . hence colloquium has focus , " grounding representations . colloquium occur over one day focus three themes : ( 1 ) biology development ; ( 2 ) computational models ( 3 ) symbol grounding . target audience colloquium include engineers scientists neural networks artificial intelligence , developmental psychologists , cognitive scientists , philosophers mind , biologists those interested application artificial intelligence real world problems . programme : monday , 15th , 1995 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * introduction : 9 . 00 registration + sustenance 10 . 00 ` introduction ' noel sharkey ( department computer science , university sheffield , england ) biology : 10 . 30 ` neuronal mechanisms language ' valentino braitenberg ( max plank institute biological cybernetics , tuebingen , germany ) computational models : 11 . 00 ` natural language exploration information space ' oliviero stock ( istituto per la ricerca scientifica e technologica , irst ) ( trento , italy ) 11 . 30 ` visual salience influences natural language descriptions ' wolfgang maass ( cognitive science programme ) ( universitaet des saarlandes , saarbruecken , germany ) 12 . 00 discussion 12 . 30 lunch grounding symbols : 2 . 00 ` grounding language neural networks ' georg dorffner ( austrian institute artificial intelligence , vienna , austria ) 2 . 30 ` observations symbol-grounding combined symbolic / connectionist viewpoint ' john barnden ( computing research laboratory , mexico , usa ) & ( department computer science , university reading , england ) 3 . 00 sustenance break 3 . 30 ` grounding symbols sensorimotor categories neural networks ' stevan harnad ( department psychology , university southampton , england ) panel discussion questions : 4 . 00 ` grounding representations ' chairs + invited speakers s / s / : 4 . 30 ` de brief / comments ' paul mc kevitt ( department computer science , university sheffield , england ) 5 . 00 o / iche mha / ith * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * publication : intend publish book colloquium proceedings . addresses iee contact : sarah leong groups officer institution electrical engineers ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . e - mail : sleong @ iee . org . uk ( sarah leong ) e - mail : mbarrett @ iee . org . uk ( martin barrett ) e - mail : dpenrose @ iee . org . uk ( david penrose ) www : http : / / www . iee . org . uk ftp : ftp . iee . org . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-497 - 3633 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-240 - 1871 ( general ) phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 171-344 - 8423 ( direct ) location : institution electrical engineers ( iee ) savoy place gb - wc2r obl , london england , uk , eu . academic contact : paul mc kevitt department computer science regent court 211 portobello street university sheffield gb - s1 4dp , sheffield england , uk , eu . e - mail : p . mckevitt @ dcs . shef . ac . uk www : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / www : http : / / www . shef . ac . uk / ftp : ftp . dcs . shef . ac . uk fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-278 - 0972 phone : + 44 ( 0 ) 114-282 - 5572 ( office ) 282-5596 ( lab . ) 282-5590 ( secretary ) registration : registration forms are available sarah leong above address sent following address : ( is possible register e - mail . ) colloquium bookings institution electrical engineers ( iee ) po box 96 stevenage gb - sg1 2sd herts england , uk , eu . fax : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 874 2792 receipt enquiries : + 44 ( 0 ) 143 876 7243 registration enquiries : + 44 ( 0 ) 171 240 1871 x . 2206 pre-registration is advised although register day event . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ r e g s t r t o n costs _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( figures include vat ) iee members 44 . 00 non-iee members 74 . 00 iee members ( retired , unemployed , students ) free non-iee members ( retired , unemployed , students ) 22 . 00 lunch ticket 4 . 70 members : members ieeie , british computer society society study artificial intelligence simulation behaviour eurel member associations admitted members ' rates .
