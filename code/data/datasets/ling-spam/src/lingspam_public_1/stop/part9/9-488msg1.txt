branimir boguraev james pustejovsky . 1996 . corpus processing lexical acquisition . mit press : cambridge , massachusetts . 245 pages . $ 32 . 50 . term " acquisition " title book refers automatic learning - - - acquisition human children , natural language systems . papers book deal topic building refining lexica natural language systems automatically - - . e . computer , little human intervention - - large corpora . building lexica natural language systems hand is difficult , expensive , labor-intensive , result date before is completed . furthermore , standards earlier systems , lexica become enormous . continuous speech dictation systems ship active vocabularies range 30 , 000 lexical items . lexica production one company are expected 200 , 000 entries american english 700 , 000 entries german . , industrial point view , work automatic acquisition lexical knowledge is welcome . is automatic lexical acquisition interest applied linguists . lexical information is necessary psycholinguistic research , work volume shows application . furthermore , sorts data researchers field are attempting acquire is sort data is needed large-scale applications formalisms head - driven phrase structure grammar . , work described book interest academic , industrial , linguists . book is result workshop , , has usual scattering topics seen proceedings . seen feature , bug : result is is something here everyone . various papers fields corpus linguistics , statistical analysis language , psycholinguistics , rule acquisition , semantics , lexical acquisition . papers are divided five broad categories : ( 1 ) unknown words , ( 2 ) building representations , ( 3 ) categorization , ( 4 ) lexical semantics , ( 5 ) evaluation . addition , paper editors lays reasons , challenges , automatic acquisition lexical information . ( 1 ) introduction issues text-based lexicon acquisition , branimir boguraev james pustejovsky . paper presents in-depth answer question lexicon builders are perenially plagued anyone whom try explain work : why on-line dictionary ? short answer is dictionaries are static evolve same pace language are attempting describe . long answer is natural language systems require information is reflected traditional dictionaries-semantic feature geometries , subcategorization frames , . : " fundamental problem lexical acquisition . . . is provide , fully adequately , systems lexical knowledge need operate proper degree efficiency . answer . . . community is converging today . . . is extract lexicon texts themselves " ( 3 ) . automatic lexical acquisition trivially solve short-answer problem allowing updating frequently data acquired . importantly , allows linguist define questions lexicon answer , rather having those questions chosen dictionary maker . ( 2 ) dealing unknown words consider spell-checking program encounters ( unknown ) word " horowitz . " spell checker best action word : is mis-spelling replaced something else , is precious datum added lexicon ? spell-checker asks user ; papers section discuss attempts answer questions automatically . linguists tend pay much attention proper nouns . mcdonald puts epigram paper volume , " proper names are rodney dangerfield linguistics . n't respect " ( 21 ) . thus , might surprise reader three papers section deal names . identification classification names is , fact , considerable interest natural language systems . relatively uninflected languages english , names constitute majority unknown words encountered corpus . names raise special issues classification , including facts multiple forms ; multiple forms same referent single text , raising problems reference coindexation ; , less theoretically interesting less morally legally compelling level , require special treatment corpus . instance , proper names are routinely removed medical data , need removed sociolinguistic data , . internal external evidence identification semantic categorization proper names . david d . mcdonald . paper is written language artificial intelligence . describes proper name facility sparser system . describes context-sensitive rewrite rules analyze " external evidence " proper names , e . g . combinatorial properties . surprising impressive aspect system described here is does stored lists proper nouns . identifying unknown proper names newswire text . inderjeet mani , t . richard macmillan . paper describes method using contextual clues appositives ( " < name > , daughter prominent local physician " " niloticist great repute , < name > " ) felicity conditions identifying names . contextual clues themselves are tapped data referents names . categorizing standardizing proper nouns efficient information retrieval . woojin paik , elizabeth d . liddy , edmund yu , mary mckenna . paper deals discovering encoding relationships between groups members . paik et al . state problem follows : " proper nouns are . . . important sources information detecting relevant document information retrieval . . . . group proper nouns ( e . g . , " middle east " ) group common nouns ( e . g . , " third world " ) match constituents unless group entity is mentioned document " ( 61 ) . problem , , is allow search " health care third world " document " health care nicaragua . " paper includes short useful discussion problems arise respect prepositions noun phrases containing proper nouns are parsed common noun phrases . ( authors solved problem changing ordering two bracketing routines . ) ( 3 ) building representations customizing lexicon better suit computational task . marti . hearst , hinrich schuetze . mentioned above , lexicon building is expensive ; paper describes method reducing development costs customizing pre-existing lexicon , rather building one . project described here uses pre-existing lexicon wordnet , on-line lexicon contains information semantic relationships hypernymy , hyponymy , etc . was customized reducing resolution semantic hierarchies simple categories , combining categories " distant parts hierarchy . . . . . are interested finding grouping terms contribute frame schema-like representation . . . achieved finding associational lexical relations among existing taxonymic relations " ( 79 ) . crucially , relations derived particular corpus . paper includes nice description algorithm used collapsing semantic categories . towards building contextual representations word senses using statistical models . claudia leacock , geoffrey towell , ellen m . voorhees . paper describes method differentiating amongst multiple senses polysemous word . authors discuss using " topical context , " content words occurring vicinity , " local context , " includes content words function morphemes , word order , syntactic structure . test three methods acquiring topical context : bayesian , context vector , neural network . results psycholinguistic experiment comparing human performance machine performance , given topical contexts created three types " classifiers . " local context acquisition is based acquiring " templates , " specific sequences words . paper gives particularly nice description algorithms , is clearly written suitable presentation courses statistics psycholinguistics . ( 4 ) categorization context driven conceptual clustering method verb classification . roberto basili , maria - teresa pazienza , paola velardi . paper describes method categorizing verbs respect thematic roles , drawing cobweb ariosto _ lex systems . aim is categorization without relying " defining features , " categorize respect domain discourse . authors describe algorithms , paper has nice literature review , covering both psycholinguistic computational perspectives classification . distinguished usage . scott . waterman . paper tackles syntax / semantics interface . author attempts linguistic grounding systems map text knowledge base means pattern matching : " relating lexical pattern-based approaches lexical semantic framework , generative lexicon theory [ pustejovsky , 1991 ] , aim is provide basis through pattern-based understanding systems understood conventional linguistic terms . . . . . main contention is framework developed viewing lexical patterns structural mappings text denotation compositional lexical semantics . . . obviating need separate syntactic semantic analysis " ( 144 ) . paper features excellent presentation background ideas explication issues discusses . ( 5 ) lexical semantics detecting dependencies between semantic verb subclasses subcategorization frames text corpora . victor poznanski , antonio sanfilippo . paper describes " suite programs . . . . elicit dependencies between semantic verb classes . . . subcategorization frames using machine readable thesauri assist semantic tagging texts " ( 176 ) . system uses commercially available thesaurus-like online lexicon semantic tagging . " subcategorization frame " is automatically extracted , subcategorization frames are analyzed classified . acquiring predicate-argument mapping information multilingual texts . chinatsu aone , douglas mckee . authors hold predicate-argument mapping equivalent conceptual representation ; , is clearly important language understanding . is paper volume deals bilingual corpora . ( 6 ) evaluating acquisition evaluation techniques automatic semantic extraction : comparing syntactic window based approaches . gregory grefenstette . paper proposes techniques comparing " knowledge-poor " approaches determining degree semantic similarity between two words . syntax-based method is compared windowing technique . syntax-based method is shown perform better high-frequency words , while windowing method is better performer low-frequency words . conclusion is means introductory text automatic lexical acquisition . nonetheless , volume contains papers appeal workers variety linguistic disciplines . reviewer k . bretonnel cohen is linguist voice input technologies dublin , ohio , where responsibilities include construction tools lexicon building analysis .
