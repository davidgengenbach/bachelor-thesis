incorporation . second chapter lays foundations characterising syntax logic separately . third chapter introduces labelled deductive systems , framework used remainder thesis . part ii is analysis morphological causatives , passives reflexives turkish . is proposed causative affix turkish has declarative content behaves predicate . unitary account is provided passivisation reflexivization whereby both processes are characterised terms logical dependency . sixth chapter is combination causatives , passives reflexives . final chapter discusses status projection principle , theta theory , case theory , mirror principle ) mono-stratal grammar . one main issues is discussed is case-marking . is proposed case gives instructions structure building combinatorial process . proposed properties case are tested causative constructions verified passives , reflexives various combinations . focus copular constructions hausa melanie green , 1997 thesis examines syntax focus constructions hausa within principles parameters / minimalist framework ( chomsky 1995 ) . unified analysis is presented account properties focus - fronting constructions hausa , properties ( apparently unrelated ) copular constructions are shown focus properties . is argued ` copula ' found both focus - fronting copular constructions hausa is verbal inflectional element argued mcconvell ( 1973 ) tuller ( 1986a ) respectively , instead spellout functional category f ( ocus ) sense brody ( 1990 ) . thesis presents introduction main syntactic characteristics hausa , general introduction phenomenon focus , including typological comparative discussion show various cross-linguistic syntactic manifestations focus . fp analysis is considered cross-linguistic perspective might account focus copular constructions range languages related hausa , is shown although languages present challenging cases fp analysis , is considerable support approach nature . movement optionality syntax anna pettiward , 1997 operation move , construed copying operation ( chomsky 1993 , 1995 ) , assumed apply principle element ( was operation move - alpha gb framework ) ? move is constrained economy conditions , rather applying , one characterize phenomena appearing involve optional movement ? are two questions thesis attempts answer ( parts ii respectively ) . part proposes copies chain - opposed ( cf . chomsky 1995 ) - are active computational system . assumption is argued length both theoretical empirical grounds . part ii develops multiple optimal derivations ( cf . chomsky 1991 ) theory syntactic optionality . detailed analysis is provided optionality ( plus associated non-optionality ) effects number languages including french ( participle agreement ) , english swedish ( optional partial associate movement non - case / agreement-checking expletives det ' ' ) , icelandic , german dutch ( optional overt object shift ) . wh - movement , licensing locality feature - checking andrew simpson , 1995 investigating syntax wh-constructions across wide variety languages , thesis re-examines assumption feature-checking relations effected within strict locality spec - head / head-adjoined configurations . range evidence apparently optional wh-movement languages hindi iraqi arabic is argued provide strong empirical challenge strict locality hypothesis indicate instead feature-checking relations fact non -

licensing combine provide four-way typology ` atr ' - type harmony . is illustrated data zulu , pulaar , turkana akan . basic mechanism is suggested subject complexity condition . examine harmony systems languages parameter switched ` ' , manifesting ` height ' / ' atr ' harmony effects : natal portugese , lena bable , yoruba ogori . finally explore implications thesis has treatment harmony languages been discussed literature e . g . chukchee , chichewa , pasiego kera . role element khalkha mongolian phonology margaret ann denwood thesis , is written within framework government phonology , revolves around phenomena related element khalkha mongolian . all-pervasive influence structural requirements explain relationship between palatal palatalised consonants umlaut vowel harmony . relationships between syllabic constituents evidence branch lay fopundation proposal mongolian , chinese , has basic four position template . number nature consonants involved sequences suggest inter-onset government takes place between onsets belonging stem suffix templates . distribution behaviour palatal palatalised consonants , showing special relationship exists between nucleus dominating ( ) preceding onset , has implications representation mongolian consonants . vowel harmony is analysed head-licensing , revised gp analysis atr - harmony . licensing constraints generate nuclear expressions , whilst additional constraints nucleus dominating doubly-linked element explain umlaut related phenomena , supporting head-licensing analysis against - harmony analysis . phonological basis speech recognition geoffrey williams , 1998 thesis explores alternative approach speech recognition based theory government phonology ( gp ) . main aim is test fundamental claim theory , phonology is central human speech recognition , means implementation theoretical argumentation . further claim thesis is application gp automatic speech recognition ( asr ) provide insights nature phonology . analysis central problems speech recognition leads conclusion decoding linear segmental model central previous phonologically motivated work , cannot succeed since constitutes neither accurate nor computationally feasible model speech processing . propose alternative approach based combination phonological parser gp elements recognition targets . first explore mapping between elements speech signal show is support direct mapping hypothesis between gp elements signal therefore form plausible recognition targets . motivate gp parser asr , claiming constituent structure understood gp recovered fairly directly signal allows reconstruction speech segments are corrupted noise effects . implementation both parser element detectors , based neural networks , is described detail . final chapter proposes functional explanations nature phonological licensing , certain distributional anomalies number languages , addressing computability phonological derivations gp comparison finite-state models . show limited derivational machinery gp ensures tractability phonological interpretation without sacrificing explanatory power . pitch accent phenomena standard japanese yuko yoshida , 1995 thesis aims demonstrate merits theoretical approach accent assignment standard japanese . furthermore , attempts show formal treatment pitch accent assignment is identical stress assignment languages english . proposed analysis is based model government-licensing , rejects idea ' inter-syllabic foot ' construction favour phonological notions 'd omain ' ' inter-nuclear licensing ' . another goal work is expand definition licensing domain - - minimal form , binary licensing domain within onset nucleus ( rhyme ) constituent , proposed kaye , lowenstamm & vergnaud ( klv ) ( 1990 ) , maximal form , phrase . levels phonological representation ( including skeletal level - - projection zero ) government / licensing relation is maximally binary ( klv 1990 ) , is around binarity inter-nuclear licensing accent assignment standard japanese is constructed . among issues addressed are ( ) explanatory account accent assignment so-called compounds , ( ii ) approach assignment pitch within sentences . issues elucidate high-pitch assignment reflects syntactic structure compound sentence question .
