is response benji wald 's comments ( 8 . 736 , disc ) functionalism : fear talking little cross-purposes here . main interest is clarifying position natural phonology issue so-called contradictory processes . benji seems little focused question means call something " cluster " phonetic terms . < deleted : elaboration nature phonetic clusters , particularly [ pt ] > > > question , remember correctly , > > was why speakers able pronounce reduced [ pt ] > > n't pronounce unreduced one . > > view said above , understand phonological > processes involved are consciously controllable , reduction ( > whatever ? ) first vowel " potato " reflects process normally > occurs speech is deliberate conscious , is > relatively spontaneous .
