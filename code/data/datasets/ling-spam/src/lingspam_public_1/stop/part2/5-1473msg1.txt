call papers ijcai-95 workshop context natural language processing august 19 , 20 , 21 , 1995 montreal , canada correct interpretation natural language utterances texts requires linguistic non-linguistic context . goal workshop is investigate nature context natural language , role natural language processing , shed light largely unexplored area great theoretical practical importance . dialogue text processing are two application domains where lack theories context impedes significant progress applying developing technologies . speech technology matures , becomes technically feasible build dialogue systems . however , understanding dialogues , especially multimodal dialogues , is possible without account role context . similarly , today 's text processing technology is feasible automatically create knowledge bases fairly unconstrained texts newspaper archives . ignoring context texts , however , results knowledge bases are incomplete , dramatically different knowledge bases created humans , based same texts . invite papers researchers active fields natural language processing , knowledge representation , related areas addressing theoretical aspects context implications designing practical nlp systems . are interested reports implemented nlp systems utilizing contextual information . are interested knowledge representation systems , inference methods , algorithms allow one computationally handle specific aspects context . agenda : our workshop provide answers insights answering number questions , including following : : role context natural language is context ? is " context previous utterance / sentence " " context dialog-so - far / text-so - far " is relationship between ? many different contexts are ? makes two contexts different ? is relationship between formalization context natural language ideas context ? is status context formal representation aiming truthfully capturing characteristics natural language ? is context inherent characteristic natural language ultimately decides formal power natural language ? is natural language minus context less powerful formal language ? does representing context truthfully capturing characteristics natural language require knowledge representation automated reasoning systems ? is relationship between context , semantics pragmatics natural language ? is context different possible worlds situations ? is relationship between domain ontologies contexts ? ii : context-dependent interpretation natural language does context affect interpretation natural language utterances texts ? aspects context contexts result refined , general , different interpretations natural language ? aspects context are explicit are implicit natural language utterances texts ? phenomena inferences observed natural language are context-independent ones always depend context ? iii : computability does handling context increase decrease computational complexity natural language processing ? automatically identify context-provided constraints resulting conveying understanding additional different aspects information ? represent those extra constraints provided context automatically compute context-dependent interpretation natural language ? final interpretation natural language decontextualized stored knowledge base ? information obtained one context utilized another , possibly unanticipated context ? workshop format : hold four sessions : : role context natural language ii : context - dependent interpretation natural language iii : computability iv : general discussion sessions , ii , iii mildly structured : first , committee present brief overview possible answers specific questions included agenda , discuss own answers . presentation mixed questions participants . second , participants whose papers were accepted briefly comment own answers questions . presentations mixed questions participants . session iv , general discussion , each participant chance statement context-related issue , comment , raise question , argue against answers etc . pre-worshop activities : pre-workshop mailing list established ; please , indicate whether want included ; order facilitate interaction focus discussion , two months before workshop , provide participants specific examples data illustrating various aspects context . authors + titles + abstracts accepted papers , papers themselves , available on-line everybody . papers available workshop participants . hope encourage strong claims even support is quite , report partial , ongoing , promising research , frank evaluating existing approaches own accomplishments , openly comment limitations , short , those ( ) informative things are sometimes difficult , impossible , communicate " official " publications . shared data , references , papers mailing list are allow participants : - sort many possible things before workshop - help focusing workshop discussion hardest most controversial issues - raise objections bring controversial claims early order prepare thought answers constructive critique participants : limited number , 30 , active participants selected basis submitted papers . small number , 5 , no-paper - attendance-only participants considered ; persons submit one page research summary list relevant publications . attendees are required register main ijcai-95 conference . schedule / deadlines : soon mosaic home page workshop set 3 . 15 . 95 papers received 4 . 03 . 95 selected papers accepted participants chosen 4 . 05 . 95 acceptance notifications sent authors sent ijcai selected papers included working notes list confirmed participants request equipment / room 4 . 15 . 95 mosaic home page workshop updated e-mail discussion begins 5 . 01 . 95 distributed participants final list specific issues discussed workshop references existing work context examples data illustrating various aspects context 7 . 15 . 95 final list participants sent ijcai 8 . 19 . 95 workshop takes place 12 . 01 . 95 written review workshop ready paper format : same ijcai-95 : 12 pt article latex style 15 pages maximum , including title , abstract , figures , references first page must include : title author 's name ( s ) affiliation complete mailing address e-mail address phone / fax number ( s ) abstract 200 words keywords submissions : electronic submissions are strongly preferred : direct : anonymous ftp ftp . cs . wayne . edu ~ pub / context directory place postscript ascii version paper , author + title + abstract ascii file , references ( bibtex format preferred ) file , file sample data / specific examples please , name files name first author . example , john block might place following : block . ps . ps version paper block . text ascii version paper . ps possible block-a . text ascii file authors names , title , abstract block-r . bbl bibliography file references block-e . text ascii file sample data / specific examples email : lucja @ cs . wayne . edu resort , four hard copies paper snail mailed lucja iwanska department computer science wayne state university detroit , mi 48202 , usa ( 313 ) 577-1667 ( phone ) ( 313 ) 577-2478 ( secretary ) ( 313 ) 577-6868 ( fax ) info workshop abstracts accepted papers is available via mosaic home page http : / / www . cs . wayne . edu / context primary contact : questions need additional information , please contact lucja iwanska department computer science wayne state university detroit , mi 48202 lucja @ cs . wayne . edu ( 313 ) 577-1667 ( phone ) ( 313 ) 577-2478 ( secretary ) ( 313 ) 577-6868 ( fax ) program committee : harry c . bunt , kub - university ( netherlands ) keith devlin , saint mary 's college ( usa ) r . v . guha , microelectronics computer technology corporation ( usa ) lucja iwanska , wayne state university ( usa ) karen jensen , microsoft corporation ( usa ) john mccarthy , stanford university ( usa ) john f . sowa , suny binghampton ( usa ) wlodek zadrozny , ibm tj watson research center ( usa )
