Subject: re : 5 . 1484 comparative syntax

since chet creider 's posting 8 dec rightly corrected misinformation gave off-the - top-of - the-head posting karamojong , decided amends doing little research ( little ) check rest said . consider xmas gift . below is relevant section recent nilo - saharan classification ( sudanic : nilotic ) . 's basically same greenberg ( 1963 ) refinements further branching rearrangement limbs . east sudanic has four branches , including eastern western , nilotic three branches , including west , east south . karamojong belongs east branch nilotic branch east sudanic . is therefore classified closer maasai ( maa - lotuko branch ) bari ( bari branch ) lwo branch west branch nilotic , closer kalenjin , group south branch ( e . g . , nandi ) west branch . following is relatively recent classification , found schadeberg 's ( 1981 ) article nilo - saharanisch . central sudanic : moru - madi - lugbara etc east sudanic : eastern : nubian western : tama , daju kuliak : ik , nilotic : west : ( call north nilotic ) burun : idem nuer - dinka : idem lwoo : north : shilluk , anwak south : achooli , luo east : ( call central nilotic ) bari : bari , kakwa etc maa - lotuko : maasai etc teso - turkana : karamojong , jie etc south : kalenjin : nandi - markweta : nandi , tuken elgon : sapiny , pok okiek / dorobo : sogoo etc datoga : etc beside bewildering array east west branches branches down sudanic line trace inaccuracy conolly 's mention jie . language , jie , along karamojong various languages teso , are part teso - turkana branch east nilotic . however , earlier classification , e . g . , crazzolara ( 1938 ) , jii is name used west nilotic ( least current lwo nuer - dinka branches ) . jii means " " ( " ordinary " ) most west nilotic languages , hence classificational name . dinka call themselves " jieng ' " . suspect east nilotic jie ( spelled " jiye " ) is same word , n't checked jie actually call themselves . african language nomenclature is full terms used speakers themselves ( often sarcastic neighbors , , example , while dinka evidently stigma autonym , achooli term somewhat english uses term " masses " , cf . hoi polloi ) . fun let 's accurate said was numbers one ten are . n't need six through nine , are compounds five plus numbers under five . data most languages are restricted happened within reach without doing library research . however , data bari teso ( ateso , experience ) are transcriptions recordings made long ago east africa before even knew languages were classified . n't published linguistic data hand . cases simplified orthography typographical ease ( losing information ) . example , " h " following vowel refers retracted ( lax - sounding ) tongue root position vowel . nilotic languages complex vowel systems " tense " " lax " subsystems . course , lexical numbers themselves prove anything genetic af finities . nevertheless , interesting patterns emerge compare currently accepted classification scheme . west nilotic : achooli anwak luo dinka nuer 1 ace : hl achyehloh achiel tok kehl 2 aryo : h areahu ariyo rou rahu 3 adeek adahgoh adehk diak dyohk 4 ang ' : hn ang ' wehnoh ang ' wen ng ' wan ng ' wan 5 abiic abiyuh abihch dhiec dye : ch 10 apaar apar apar thiaar wahl first consonant ' 5 ' seems diagnostic distinctness nuer - dinka lwoo group . otherwise , dinka ' 1 ' is wierd , is first consonant dinka ' 10 ' ( cf . dinka - nuer ' 5 ' ) , much wierder comparison indo - european numbers ( cf . germanic ' 4 - 5 ' slavic ' 9-10 ' ) . reconstruction is difficult , although n't accurate transcription vowel distinctions ( tone ) . east south ( nandi ) nilotic : ( afro - asiatic : cushitic ) bari teso maasai nandi somali 1 kyeling ' diopeti - bo akenge kow ( southern ' hal ' ) 2 morehk iyere - re aeng lamma 3 msala : iu ~ li - uni somok siddah 4 ingwan iwong ' wahn - ong ' uan angwan afar 5 mukanad ikany imiet mut shan 10 pwahk itomony tomon taman tommon numbers ' 2 ' ' 4 ' are consistent west nilotic . otherwise , lexicon appears areally defined . first maasai nandi seem cognate west nilotic ' 5 ' . however , maasai is classified bari teso east nilotic . thus , bari teso seem share innovation ' 5 ' does extend maasai south nilotic . meanwhile cognacy bari ' 3 ' teso maasai is questionable , nandi ' 3 ' is beyond pale . interestingly , data bari has ' 10 ' given , while greenberg gives bari ' 10 ' " mere " one mass cognate sets ( p . 106 ) .
