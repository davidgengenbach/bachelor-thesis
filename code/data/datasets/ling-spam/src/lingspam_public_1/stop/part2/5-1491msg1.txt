call papers workshop connectionist - symbolic integration : unified hybrid approaches held ijcai ' 95 montreal , canada august 19-20 , 1994 has been considerable amount research integrating connectionist symbolic processing . while approach has clear advantages , encounters serious difficulties challenges . therefore , various models ideas been proposed address various problems aspects integration . is growing interest many segments ai community , ranging expert systems , cognitive modeling , logical reasoning . two major trends identified state art : are unified purely hybrid approaches integration . whereas purely connectionist ( " connectionist-to - the-top " ) approach claims complex symbol processing functionalities achieved via neural networks alone , hybrid approach is premised complementarity two paradigms aims synergistic combination systems comprising both neural symbolic components . fact , trends viewed two ends entire spectrum . till , overall , is still relatively little work comparing combining fairly isolated efforts . workshop provide forum discussions exchanges ideas area , foster cooperative work . workshop tackle important issues integrating connectionist symbolic processing . tentative schedule day 1 : . introduction : * invited talks talks provide overview field set tone ensuing discussions . * theoretical foundations integrating connectionist symbolic processing b . definition two approaches : * exhaust space current research connectionist-symbolic integration , is room additional categories ? * compare unified hybrid approaches ? * unified hybrid approaches constitute clearcut dichotomy are endpoints continuum ? * class processes problems is well-suited unified hybrid integration ? relevant motivations objectives . * type model is suitable type application ? enumerate viable target domains . c . state art : * recent ongoing theoretical experimental research work * implemented models belonging either unified hybrid approach * practical applications both types systems research addressing key issues concerning : * unified approach : theoretical practical issues involving systematicity , compositionality variable binding , biologically inspired models , connectionist knowledge representation , high-level connectionist models . * hybrid approach : modes methods coupling , task sharing between various components hybrid system , knowledge representation sharing . * both : commonsense reasoning , natural language processing , analogical reasoning , generally applications unified hybrid models . day 2 : d . cognitive aspects : * cognitive plausibility relations ai paradigms * cognitive modeling , why integrate connectionist symbolic processing ? * is clear cognitive rationale integration ? ( need examine detail typical areas , commonsense reasoning , natural language processing ) * is psychological / biological evidence existing models ? , is ? e . open research issues : * propose common terminology precise definitions both approaches connectionist-symbolic integration location continuum ? * far unified systems ? unified models supplemented hybrid models ? hybrid models supplanted unified models ? * limitations barriers faced both approaches * breakthroughs are needed both approaches ? * is possible synthesize various existing models ? workshop format - panel discussions - mini-group discussions : participants break groups 7 / 8 discuss given theme ; group leaders form panel report group discussions attempt synthesis audience participation - interactive talks : is novel type oral presentation experiment . instead classical presentation , speaker present problem issue brief statement personal stand ( 5 min ) launch discussions moderate conclude . - classical slide talks followed q / discussions . workshop co - chairs : frederic alexandre , crin - cnrs / inria - lorraine ron sun , university alabama organizing committee : john barnden , mexico state university steve gallant , belmont research inc . larry medsker , american university christian pellegrini , university geneva noel sharkey , sheffield university program committee : lawrence bookman ( sun laboratory , usa ) michael dyer ( ucla , usa ) wolfgang ertel ( frw , germany ) limin fu ( university florida , usa ) jose gonzalez - cristobal ( upm , spain ) ruben gonzalez - rubio ( university sherbrooke , canada ) jean - paul haton ( crin - inria , france ) melanie hilario ( university geneva , switzerland ) abderrahim labbi ( imag , france ) ronald yager ( iona college , usa ) schedule : - submission deadline participants is february 1 , 1995 . - authors potential participants notified acceptance decision march 15 , 1995 . - camera-ready copies working notes papers due april 15 , 1995 submission : - wish present talk , specify preferred type presentation ( classical interactive talk ) submit 5 copies extended abstract ( within limit 5 - 7 pages ) : ron sun department computer science university alabama tuscaloosa , al 35487 rsun @ cs . ua . edu ( 205 ) 348-6363 - wish attend workshop , send 5 copies short ( one page ) description interest same address above . - please sure include e-mail address submissions .
