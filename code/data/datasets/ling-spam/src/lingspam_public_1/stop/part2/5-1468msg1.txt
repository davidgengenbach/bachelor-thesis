Subject: comparative method

are notes after recent discussions karl teeter , amramer , sally thomason , after aaa meetings sessions distant language reconstructions , response part mr . poser 's message 14 december . first , most discussion karl teeter agree wholeheartedly except criteria absolutes . even grammatical things borrowed ( sally pointed ) . practice * * * correctly * * * accept language family uto - aztecan essentially proven , even grammar has been written proto-language , parts grammar are written . one hand , nobody disturbed much turned one assumed uto - aztecan languages was originally another family , truly massive borrowing uto - aztecan . overall hypothesis uto - aztecan family shaken . hand , asking question much grammar proto-language has written reveals non-absoluteness criterion . tiny bit ? might subject one special cases morphology grammar were borrowed ( sally 's general type example ) . , again , karl is right general , wrong single criterion is taken absolute ( unless circularly many criteria are combined feats legalese single criterion ) . modify amramer 's statement exactly same spirit : ) cannot demand detailed morphological reconstruction ) until languages are accepted related . is too strong . is quite same ramer 's ) surely does mean comparative grammar is ) prerequisite reconstruction ; is part reconstruction . practice , extensive comparative grammar is indeed written part reconstruction ( ramer 's second wording above , first above ) , is likely written unless * * * both * * * following two conditions are fulfilled : 1 ) languages are fact related ( makes grammar easier write ) 2 ) enough scholars believe languages might related put effort establishing links . is unwarranted discouragement second needs dealt our field . ramer is right linguists discourage attempts prove has already been proven . risk-taking , words . researchers , attempting write grammar altaic example , report results , both genetic relatedness , borrowing , host questions even thought started research . researchers evaluate hypothesis started . often differences viewpoint amount nothing elevation one does oneself " true " " real " work field , instead recognizing takes number different contributions . illustrate karl teeter 's recent messages , malice intended , am absolutely sure intends none himself . modifying wording account amramer 's point course properly classify languages basis phonological correspondences , teeter writes 10 december : " since is clear everybody 's first approximation linguistic history begins classification . is cannot reconstruct languages basis . " ( please note words " first approximation " . cannot reconstruct languages bases classification alone seems tautology . ) later same message , teeter reverts absolute statement : " contrary , contention ( invention ) , is establish languages are related is write grammar proto - langauge show developed different later grammars . " ( please note words " " " establish " . using words does change fact uto - aztecan is * * * correctly * * * accepted proven family without teeter 's criteria being satisfied . ) 8 december , teeter wrote : ) " systematic correspondences sounds vocabularies " prove ) connection between languages , is certainly interesting ) first step , real work comparative grammar starts : [ teeter mentions four possible explanations , one genetic ] ) until one exclude first three factors , one has proven ) nothing regarding genetic relationship . teeter discounts enormous work discovering likely language families first place , trivializes " real work " establishment systematic sound correspondences proving " nothing " regarding genetic relationship . contrary , does prove grouping legitimate candidate genetic relationship , often nature sound correspondences found made one alternatives less probable . work comparative-historical grammarians is " real work " . is work those spend enormous hard-working hours sifting potential cognates discover potential sound correspondences . teeter others really knowledge much work takes ? stage is something ever completely proven absolute sense ( even after comparative grammar is written , potential undiscovered problems kind noted sally thomas ) . stages process contribute end result . stages are equally " real work " . proof is always incremental , nothing , complete absolute . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * turn next mr . poser 's message , information gleaned aaa meetings . perhaps mr . poser surprised am enthusiastically favor anyone correcting errors claims language relationship language structure , including mr . poser 's mention kimball correcting errors muskogean , even especially means greenberg claim pronouns amerind is weakened . is actually claims morphology where expect greenberg is least likely succeeded contributing something . thank mr . poser bibliography check against lists corrections note muskogean pronouns . agree mr . poser criticism errors data does rely mere authority critic . ( was point appeals authority , one mr . poser 's paragraphs was directly relevant . earlier point appeals authority remains . ) did indicate ( mr . poser 's message suggests ) critics complained errors back . did was claimed greenberg 's errors made method worthless , without bothering test whether correction errors actually lead change conclusions , without promptly providing data others carry test . ) conversations , judge are still reluctant face test , one required part claims . ( even claims point prove wrong degree , conclusions greenberg 's method mostly remain same even after errors those kinds are corrected , still follow greenberg 's methods produce valid results regular basis . please notice careful is important notions proof against anything . ) conversation bob rankin recent aaa meetings indicated was glad greenberg had made attempt morphology , 3rd - person alternation between / y / / t / putative relic irregularity , was equally likely end believing had discovered typological fact , preference unmarked segments recurring conditions under might alternate less same , might indicate same phenomenon arise chance repeatedly . are always dealing simultaneously possibilities genetic relationship convergent evolution . general warning danger throwing hypotheses too early are " obviously " cases chance lookalikes convergent evolution , article " common pathways illumination " stephen jay gould harvard , natural history magazine , december 1994 pp . 10-20 , discusses origins eyes different phyla animal kingdom . states had been classic case biology , used show convergent evolution originally unrelated organs serve same function . however , dna specialists gotten hands one , apparently is * * * same dna * * * is regulating important parts production eyes various phyla , barring course few changes few amino acid codes . dna is therefore genetically inherited ( are talking far back common node family tree drosophila fruit flies , squids , humans ! ) . line argument holds , quite revolution thinking our hands . ( thinking course far overboard too . ) " chance lookalikes " certainly exist massively . sound symbolism is typological basis recurrence . too-easy " chance lookalikes " reject comparisons however too-easy " substrate " many ways purporting explain phenomena , reality merely naming without doing hard work really explaining . another factual contribution discussion greenberg 's errors , bob rankin clarified aaa meetings had looked greenberg 's original notebooks , apparently happened is greenberg had single flexible flap notebook bearing language names , sheets matched against enter data particular lexical items . is mechanism subject errors two pieces paper slipping vertically relative each , fact were rather large number errors . was errors rows rather columns ( loosely had assumed without ever bothering ask rows columns ) . mr . poser originally asked 9th november whether " limitations [ comparative method ] had been were being used justify resistance proposals emote relationships . . . " please careful note wording , mr . poser changed wording message 14 december , asserts example has been given . gave mr . poser eyewitness account satisfying wording used . stand eyewitness account . ( naming names ever matters , mr . poser 's assertion answered eyewitness account . ) none mr . poser 's supposed rebuttal recent message is relevant claim , though is relevant another claim , absurd one , did . ( previous message , mr . poser mixes several different wordings are quite radically different hypotheses . extended discussion variants relevant our central points , omit . ) specific absurd claim did * * , quite agree mr . poser same criticize greenberg 's hypotheses based factual data . never denied , fact took pains refer work same , always emphasized importance having corrections data . mr . poser 's conclusion was : ) thus appears , thought , are real examples perceived ) limitations comparative method being used basis rejecting ) proposals genetic affiliation . since gave eyewitness account example perceived limitations being used one basis rejecting proposals genetic affiliation , mr . poser maintain original assertion converting different assertion has here , namely is case person using those perceived limitations " " ( read " " ) basis rejecting proposals . simply repeat case was eyewitness , tone presentation was quite clear absurdity depth was sufficient * * * itself * * * rule legitimacy attempting distant comparison . ( critique errors greenberg 's data is directly relevant point , even engaged same person . ) apparently mr . poser wants allies persons work , nothing wrong . cannot posit division between " holy " " unclean " , caste distinctions traditional india . one has right position vis vis good-faith researchers , however much disagree data , results , methods . gather conversations aaa involved become moderate since earlier years matters , least public statements . is certainly . are small beginnings developments method turn relevant our current limitations . am perplexed mr . poser 's discussion supposed rule using three-consonant matches never merely two-consonant matches . although used siouxan - yuchi , amerindianists are considering , point does depend slightest whether one believes two particular nodes are related . perhaps someone propose another alternative ( suggest looking one tibeto - burman , where perhaps one consonant , one vowel , tone available , yet genetic relations are cases secure . ) agree mr . poser is better three consonants two , precisely helps avoid chance resemblances . stated previous message . means difference between us is mr . poser consider treating preferred method ( 3 consonants ) permitted one : ) ( probably contrary fact ) , matches three consonants are ) necessary exclude chance , . . . why ) unwilling , case , conclude either are ) related , are , relationship is demonstrable . problem here is notion particular rule * even conceivably * " necessary exclude chance " . rule is necessary exclude chance . large number procedures methods * * * help * * * exclude chance . except most difficult cases , probably most single rules violated , still enough ways excluding chance result achieved . is fossilization response expansions methods available part " comparative method " is damaging increasing rigor power our field . is encouraging sessions distant language relationships . firmly believe sessions occurring nor much work studying methods , greenberg had published book . growth interdisciplinary cooperation communication was process happening anyway , greenberg accidentally published . ( am trying credit causing interest . ) particularly liked john colarusso 's contribution eurasian session , outlined views why distant language comparisons are difficult progressive loss data , yet is business criticizing attempt . is business himself contributing deepening both linguistic mythological comparisons much areas are still great extent uncharted . johanna nichols provoked much thought methods , ways integrating information peripheries vs . centers innovation residue repeated waves innovation visible even peripheries , pattern projecting homeland backwards . am somewhat skeptical distant language comparisons involve identities sound correspondence , precisely is easy approach select old still relatively recent layer borrowings ( recent node family tree struggling reach ) . greenberg pointed , increase number conditioning contexts over , once approaches number lexical items available comparison , leads result are virtually recurrences exactly same sound correspondences . please separate message sharpen our tools deal , titled " typology historical change " . means start somewhat skeptical alan bomhard 's nostratic similar comparisons , precisely uses preferentially sound correspondences identity . personal bias , end granting strictness sound correspondences actually work over great depths . cannot presume . was one session did attend report here abstract , researchers reported results mitochondrial dna studies various native american populations . expected , eskimo athabaskan were separable ( one variety each ? ) . remainder native american populations shared four varieties mitochondrial dna , either without subgrouping , perhaps two major subgroups . bob rankin did attend says authors presentation had down side two major subgroups . population genetics need match language directly , data is still least interesting obliquely relevant . . . lloyd anderson
