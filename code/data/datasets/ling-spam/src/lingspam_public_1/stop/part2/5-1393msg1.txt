Subject: comparative method syntax

fritz newmeyer asks is legitimate apply comparative method syntax . answer is yes , is difficult . main reason why one sees work historical-comparative syntax fifty years ago is syntax has become much prestigious recent decades . n't was shift once " standard " view syntactic reconstruction is impossible . bernhard delbrueck 's historical-comparative syntax indo - european , published hundred years ago , clearly showed comparative syntax is both possible fruitful , perhaps too difficult attract many followers . view historical-comparative syntax is impossible was defended detail lightfoot 's ( 1979 ) principles diachronic syntax , few researchers seem been discouraged lightfoot 's attitude . is true latin syntax hardly reconstructed modern romance languages , neither latin morphology , even view latin phonology romance is distorted . our reconstruction protolanguage grammar is always imperfect , is reason attempt reconstruction . main error lightfoot 's side is is syntactic analog regularity sound change . 's bit complicated syntax - - syntax is complicated overall phonology . basically , analog phonemes words are words sentences . true , difference between words sentences is general sentences are stored lexicon . neither are many complex words ( rendering morphological reconstruction similarly difficult , nobody seems ever objected morphological reconstruction ) , sentences are actually stored , e . g . proverbs idioms , often show syntactic archaisms . since earlier syntax often survives " fossilized " form later morphology , another rich source data diachronic syntax . addition regularity change , need general principles change plausible reconstruction , e . g . phonological principles predict likely changes assimilation , lenition , segment loss , etc . syntax , similar principles change exist : spatial nouns become spatial adpositions , certain general verbs become tense aspect markers , allative case markers become dative case markers , purposive verb forms become infinitives , etc . processes ( instances grammaticalization ) are irreversible changes provide safe guides linguists seeking sense daughter language diversity reconstructing proto-syntax . massive regularities grammaticalization are generally ignored generative studies syntactic change ( indeed , lightfoot argues are genuine principles diachronic syntax ) , one takes account , help difficult task reconstruction . martin haspelmath ( free university berlin )
