( 1 ) : ' m afraid is n't much help . b : _ words _ , n't want bothered . although interpretation process ( 1 ) is close is called " conventional " , . e . might processed spontaneously , without inferential process hearer 's mind , b guesses 's real intent , is directly inferred 's utterance , indirect - ly 's implicature . order b necessitate iow , b exploits / background assumption / encyclopedic knowledge , implicating is busy , does n't feel ease b . let implicature explained c , sequential flow consciousness / inferential process $ @ " * ( jc $ @ " * ( jb emerges . iow is visible index hearer 's implicature-interpretation process . speaker / hearer 's background assumption varies between common sense knowledge is valid between speaker hearer .
