summary responses request information judgment fatigue ( called syntactic satiation ) original post : linguist list : vol-6 - 974 . mon jul 17 1995 . issn : 1068-4875 . special thanks following respondents : kimberly barskaitiki , tim beasley , elizabeth bergman , michael bernstein , vivian cook , joseph davis , rianne doeleman , karen emmorey , suzette haden elgin , ted harding , stephen helmreich , erika l . konrad , john e . limber , bruce nevin , john robert ross , carson t schutze , linda shockey , william snyder , karin stromswold , joyce tang boyland , anyone missed , anyone thought responding has n't yet . karin stromswold william snyder actually investigated phenomenon . read either papers yet , forward doing . william snyder ( snyder @ psyche . mit . edu ) presented poster topic lsa 1994 , was mentioned rick hudson 's summary post july 29 , 1994 . individual 's interested dr . snyder 's poster contact directly . hudson 's post ( linguist list : vol-5 - 855 . fri 29 jul 1994 . issn : 1068-4875 . ) summarized literature available addresses difference between linguists ' non-linguists ' intuitions . hudson mentions ( does cite ) four references provided joyce tang boyland regarding satiation effects ( both syntactic semantic ) . hudson 's original post is available linguist list archives . joyce tang boyland 's response is included below ( part ii post , following ) . karin stromswold 's response ( karin @ muddle . rutgers . edu ) was connection snyder , hudson , boyland . post is most relevant original query is included entirety below ( part ii post , following ) . most responses mentioned influence continual repeated exposure over period , either mentioning examples similar perceptual semantic satiation word-repetition effect . ( bergman , cook , davis , doeleman , haden elgin , harding , helmreich , limber , schutze , snyder , stromswold , tang boyland ) . are many differences , however , between effects semantic satiation " syntactic satiation " judgment fatigue : first , semantic satiation is detachment form meaning occurs continuously repeat lexical item ( stromswold 's post below ) . judgment fatigue , contrast , cannot induced repeated presentation sentence . fact , published experiments nagata show raters ' intuitions become stringent repeated presentation . second , loss meaning sentence is effect judgment fatigue . meaning sentence quite lucid individual reading , individual 's attention is focused upon aspect grammatical acceptability sentence , is ability judge grammatical acceptability is lost , ability sense utterance . third , while particular characteristics stimuli induce judgment fatigue are yet fully established , appears different types sentences induce effect different degrees ( stromswold , snyder cited hudson 's post ) . is case semantic satiation , where repetition lexical item induce effect . fourth , " scanting " effect noted haj ross points loss intuition triggered one single stimuli , necessarily repeated presentation numerous stimuli ( relevant quote posted below ) . conversely , subjects rate hundreds stimuli basis grammaticality , fatigue effect ( beyond boredom ) , even stimuli contain permutation same lexical items , open closed class items . note point four is definitely true case stimuli are dichotomously " great - - grammatical " " horrible - - ungrammatical " . is definite influence marginality , effect , date , believe one has explained . fifth , semantic satiation ( perceptual fatigue effects ) is often attributed type neurological fatigue cortical level . ( ) reason judgment fatigue , however , single word syntactic structure is repeated stimuli ( case judgment fatigue induced scope negation negative polarity items ) . reason , quite implausible claim judgment fatigue is result type physiological / chemical / neurological saturation has occurred cortical level . point , believe judgment fatigue semantic satiation much common behavioral disturbances . ( incidently , while am expert semantic satiation , yet been forced evidence believe semantic satiation is result low-level neurological fatigue . perceptual fatigue is neurological phenomenon , attribute semantic satiation conceptual strategies . ) many linguists ( beasley , nevin , konrad , one anonymous ) observed ' longer stay linguistics , less speak english . ' quote bruce nevin 's response : < < student was once asked , hearing , certain famous linguist was native speaker english . reply : ' used . ' > > hudson 's previous summation further confirms linguists non-linguists demonstrate significantly different abilities discriminating grammatical ungrammatical sentences . type long-term " drift " linguists ' judgments interest own regard , type " judgment drift " is identical temporary loss linguistic intuition intended address . noted beasley konrad , indeed case exposure second languages , exposure dialects different ones native dialect , exposure large number perhaps marginal sentences occur rarely natural spoken written contexts ( sentences demonstrating violations theoretical principals " weak crossover " " island constraints " , example ) actually alter individual 's criteria grammatical acceptability . one understands judgments grammatical acceptability metalinguistic type-categorizations , one expect individual 's discriminative ability altered based upon individual 's personal experiences exemplars categories . others commented judgment fatigue does happen stimuli are contextualized ( davis , nevin ) referential situation is concrete rather abstract ( davis , doeleman , nevin ) . is case . loss linguistic intuition grammatical acceptability definitely happen spontaneously , while one is listening conversation reading texts , regardless concreteness topic , following qualifications : judgment fatigue is inspired particular types stimuli ( yet been clearly defined , part ii post , following ) listener 's / reader 's focus upon grammar utterance sentence . individuals related hard-to - comprehend sentences examples inducing judgment fatigue . sentences , notably sentences involving scope ambiguity , induce confusion , confusion is synonymous loss ones own linguistic intuitions . ambiguous confusing stimuli , , " someone rewrite sentence . is ambiguous ( anomalous ) . " judgment fatigue , , " ' m monoglot , damned decide whether sentence is grammatical . sure n't feel native english speaker ! " lastly , responses general expressions empathy encouragement , actual examples ( barskaitiki , emmorey , shockey ) . thank again responded . are interested current proposal experiments , hear results conclusions experiments am finished running , please contact . please part ii ( posted separately ) selected quotes respondents .
