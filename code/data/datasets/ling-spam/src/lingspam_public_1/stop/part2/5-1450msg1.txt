" bw : newmeyer 's reference proto - germanic reveals even romance " basic " word order is villainous concept reconstruction case , " basic " word orders compared across related languages reconstruct " proto-basic " word orders , " minor " word orders ignored reconstructed " proto-minor " word orders . one principle emerges our knowledge historical record is word order change does n't work , . e . , word orders cannot compartmentalized " basic " " minor " diachronic purposes . principle : want develop tools principles syntactic reconstruction , really consider functions served various word orders different times , detect changes functions diachronically . words , word order change language must studied context totality functions word orders given . difference between study study change " basic " word order , latter means anything , is analogous study phonetic change phonemic change . analysts argue notion " basic " word order , is analogous arguing different concepts phoneme , agreed upon linguistic facts . fallacy reconstructing " basic " word order proto - germanic basis " basic " word order current germanic becomes obvious according above principle sov word order subordinate clauses continental germanic . even is invariant property oldest texts is later standardised languages , e . g . , before middle german dutch . english clues us inversion many remnants , even without historical texts reveal similarities continental germanic , e . g . , v - first following subordinate clause adverb , still common av bible . including english excluding gothic mirrors extent possible testament greek syntax was translated , earliest texts germanic show , far , tendency relatively favorable verb-final subordinate clauses , much variation , later eliminated continental standards . leads arguments whether sov tendency was break-up earlier general indo - european sov tendency ( earlier fixation ? ) died english scandinavian ( including still highly inflected icelandic - - creating problems even simplistic functional arguments evolution svo germanic , argument : started reaction increasing unreliability case distinction spread social reasons languages did n't need . argument does strike unreasonable ! ) . [ although excluded gothic above , malleable accommodation greek syntax , deviations nt greek are quite revealing . most salient is absence definite article , despite occurrence nt greek germanic languages . gothic translation was totally serious imitating nt greek syntax cases adopted unstressed demonstrative imitate greek article , later germanic did ( sense ) . most important question gothic syntax is : is malleability syntax innovative proto - germanic ? - - , probably never ways gothic translations nt greek stretched limits malleability , distorted colloquial functions word order spoken gothic generally germanic third century . sov was invariant ancestor , why did deteriorate germanic ? least puzzling , / why / did germanic aux inversion , even yes / questions . indo - european languages show wh fronting wh questions , is reason believe proto - language did . buying newmeyer is questioning preceding argument , cf . fn : " impression increasing frequency , one comes across statements following literature : " most attested languages language family x syntactic property . therefore assume proto - x had property . " " bw : [ why " increasing frequency " ? is implication copy-cat historical linguists are becoming less responsible used ( cf . discussion spread rumors number eskimo words snow ) , syntax is driving historical linguistics pot ? ] safe , guess ancillary arguments , : considering areally widespread ie languages are , is likely unanimity wh first questions across ie is reflective proto-language ? ok , maybe wh fronting is proto - ie ( got better explanation facts ? reason ignore ? ) , why aux inversion germanic questions . does application inversion yes / questions mean was question marker initial position ( wh question position ) yes / questions , " / hullo , are kidding ? " ( marker " ibai " is found gothic whenever testament greek original has " : " ) . n't wrong . ' m suggesting initial yes / question-marker was necessary condition inversion innovation germanic .

( fact , least likely morphologise . ) considering s represents unstressed anaphor v - s , s might minor word order position . [ note basic word order means arguments are nominal , pronominal , discourse frequency is criterial basic , since least most subject arguments are pronominal , merely inflectional . furthermore , " basic " counts relative frequency subject nominals , is based something is quite rare discourse : subject nominals ] . case , subject inflection following verb stem is widespread eurasian areal feature , extending africa semitic various branches afro - asiatic . might taken clue correctness nostratic super-family notions , others indication extremely old innovation having spread ( over millenia ? ) across families regardless genetic relationship ( cf . famous balkan area ) . still others might opt coincidence . various languages feature , e . g . , kanuri west africa various world languages . ( welcome nostratic ? ) questions functions position after verb so-called sov languages are raised v - s inflectional order . typological implications beyond current knowledge , although dimly remember various eurasian sov languages are different according whether function post-verb - al position has languages . is obvious , example , contrast between eurasian sov languages ( differences amongst themselves ) so-called sovx west african languages , where x is adpositional phrase ( complications origin adpositional phrases languages refrain discussing here ) . since many eurasian sov languages are v - s inflectional languages , are sov languages " minor " postverbal position anaphoric subject ( turns positions certain constructions , demonstrate is inflection ) . maybe typology relevant amerind languages help solve problem . maybe anticipate reappearance party-spoiling question representativeness curent language types possible ( former ) language types . doubt unwelcome ( unhelpful ? ) thought many . context seems worth mentioning mathematical probability arguments various word orders , seen practiced , are impressive , faults initial assumptions . example , far , invariably assume validity counting number languages , regardless genetic relationship areal contiguity languages counted . seems unsound , particularly ignoring areal contiguity . example , ( ) eurasian area , consisting umpteen umpred languages , has s . . . o word order ( ignoring position verb independent variable ) . world large areas contiguous s . . . o order , separate areas o . . . s order . maybe calculating mathematical probability basis contiguous area rather number languages . surprising result might o . . . s is probable s . . . o ( where area is independent variable , individual language , course . ) ' m sure implications might , one might o . . . s might once been likely ordering strategy is , predominance s . . . o across languages counted individually is largely result areal spread .

" bw : thrust fn 's suggestion here is largely right , though probably vastly overstated ( basis older ideas creoles ? ) . however , questions remain mind conditions under things happen . within monolingual areas ( among closely related , mutually intelligible languages , ( certain types ? ) syntactic strategies seem potential spead quite quickly , perhaps almost quickly words expressions , while comparable speed is generally observed phonological change ( is probably " unlikely impossible " , newmeyer puts , both internal linguistic social reasons - - fact , " unlikely " is accurate " impossible " depending nature particular type phonological change , example possible single-generation phonological change current english african americans york city area , sufficient data possibility implications worth discussing here - - until section labov 's book where discusses recent innovations chicago vowel system sure has examples ) . however , extent language-contact propels " cataclysmic " syntactic change ( historical record ) fn 's suggestion is clear . example , english east la ( mexican american community ) is immediately strikingingly different adjacent english dialects phonological syntactic level . applies monolingual speakers east la english spanish - english bilinguals , various phonological segments intonational contours ] . understanding historical syntactic evolution , is most often difficult distinguish internal evolution language contact ( hence sour regard substratal theories during late 19th - to-mid 20th c celebration neogrammarian achievements ) - - is jakobson 's caution language contact might permit evoluton is internally possible anyway , rather promote one possible direction change opposed possible directions might flourish under external circumstances . too consider problematic blanket statement , major consideration keep mind possible constraint change most reconstructive expeditions unknown past . enough . are thoughts problems using comparative method alone reconstruct syntax . nobody suggest something foolish enlisting possible tools reconstruction , including internal typological addition comparative . conversely , equally foolish shun comparative method reconstructive tool . case , notion basic word order is helpful syntactic reconstruction , doubtful value autonomous observation synchronic state language . mean 's ok observe english french are both synchronically svo ( spoken french even english - - least former 's preferred question formation strategies ) , without further discussion does mean syntaxes are " basically " same , insightful interesting ( coin adjective ) sense . readers react points made above , least accuracy facts suggested various languages , since am expert areas most facts presented , e . g . , current typological theory , indo - european linguistics , eurasian world areal syntactic characteristics . benji
