Subject: typology historical change

typology historical change note tries explicit granted , discussed others occasion , perhaps needs explicit statement . one most fruitful avenues research distant language comparison , believe , is growth field call typology historical change . under rubric include example work johanna nichols ( whether agree data , findings particulars method , is relevant point ; still helps our thinking along ) . include , is challenge want issue , * * * mode discourse * * * mr . vovin asked recently help finding typological parallels hypothesis was interested phrase meaning " water falls " fossilize ( ? ) basic word " rain " . response query , got back positive answers , examples claimed fit description . method reasoning , is need . is , accumulations attested examples particular changes , educate our intuitions naively are " possible " semantic shifts ever experience actual semantic shifts are known suspected . help us improve our methods guestimating possible language relationships , least given hypothesized semantic shift is frequently attested , is straining compare lexical items whose meanings differ . whereas contrast another hypothesized semantic shift is firmly attested . unattested semantic shift probably used those distant language comparisons are themselves most difficult , over large spans number context-sensitive conditioning environments is great number lexical items available compare , thus are few * * * recurring * * * sound correspondences . words , move towards deeper comparisons , must rely ways measuring " distance " semantic shift " distance " phonological change , rather measuring repeating sound correspondences semantic identities . yet our tools doing sharpened , proceed gradually sharpen . study known attested cases is best start . words , someone really wants our methods fare gradually distant language comparisons , methods fare , tabulate , known language relationships , ( ) proportion sound-correspondence repetition comparable vocabulary ( " comparable " means is itself variable , exclusively defined ( b ) ( c ) ) ( b ) " semantic distance " along attested paths semantic change lexical items being compared . where multiple shifts been attested , estimated " distance " counts closer , smaller . where few shifts been attested , estimated " distance " counts greater . course enough information database form present , whatever used provisionally , explained ( d ) ( c ) " phonetic distance " along attested paths phonetic change lexical items being compared . is relatively knowledge available phonological change . ( d ) exploring three measures above vary greater depths . is , using first assured cases , less assured ones , does weighted average " closeness " compared lexical items vary increasing depths ? does proportion regular often recurring sound correspondences unique rarely recurring sound correspondences vary increasing depths ? is development tools ( b , c ) most advance our abilities compare greater depths , improve our methods . grateful anyone points studies approximate parts program outlined above . " comparative method " currently does benefit fully developed tools kind . degree , current comparative methods considered less rigorous ought , reason powerful distant language comparisons sometime . future comparative method tools precisely . real challenge today existing comparativists is avoid artificially fossilizing term " comparative method " , avoid treating methods fixed subject improvement supplementing newer powerful methods , are methods science . healthy word " " were dropped term were made mass plural term " comparative methods " . implies lessening rigor . indeed , been pains point above , firmly believe limitations present state comparative methods result * * * lack rigor * * * area typology possible changes ( phonetic , semantic , grammatical ) . work discussed bill croft topic syntactic reconstruction typology is certainly relevant concerns raised here . are seeing beginnings paradigm focus paths change language , comparative-historical linguists left behind add techniques box tools ( while keeping techniques already ) . lloyd anderson
