Subject: sum : vowel length orthographies

few weeks ago posted query orthographic marking vowel length , special reference korean . received many interesting replies , both korean general question , summarise below - whole topic raises issues might comment further . first though - thanks everyone took trouble send information . was first linglist query ' m delighted works ! taken ages assemble examples library research . first was surprised lot replies suggesting examples languages dont mark vowel length , english , german . realised been clearer original request . . fox put problem question : ' query writing vowel length is slightly odd , since implies most languages contrastive vowel-length writing system represents . depends mean ' representing ' vowel-length ; sense having explicit consistent marker length , double letter , diacritic length mark , is common , least languages am familiar . length implicitly marked variety ways , therefore discoverable spelling anyone ( literate native speaker ) knows system . ' 'd intended include things ways ' representing ' vowel length ; definitely cases where vowel length is represented feature own right macron , double symbol etc . wanted was examples languages extensive system minimal pairs differentiated wholly mainly vowel length identical orthographic representations members pairs . is situation korean , quite largish set words both one two syllables . 's definitely situation english , german , canadian french , danish etc . dont situation latin either , though might wrong , glad correction . here quite few languages were suggested , vowel length is predictable aspect word ( including lexical identity ) dont actually many minimal pairs differentiated length . right ? same appear case hausa ; possibly estonian vowel length contrast ? estonian is bit rusty , right guessing full three contrast is fairly limited ? however , several pacific languages were mentioned seem fit bill : tokelauan , samoan , maori , fijian ponapeic languages are candidates having call genuine length contrast ( although seems maori rate system contrasts is quite limited ) , is least sometimes shown orthography . , seems , does australian language bardi , orthography doesnt show . . thing found interesting was number sent anecdotal evidence native speakers languages feel marking vowel length . writing systems are course relatively recent introductions based roman alphabet , are plenty ways show vowel length . dont always potential seems . apparently speakers ponapeic languages length marking inconsistently , fijian speakers , maori speakers ' unnatural ' dont using , tokelauan teachers decided teach , samoa length marker is banned ! seems something worth exploring here . obvious hypothesis is though words are differentiated phonetically length , is distinction is most salient native speakers . next obvious hypothesis is is kind lexical distinction , similar english ' ' vs ' food ' , ' boot ' vs 's oot ' , ' ' vs ' loop ' etc is perfectly simple native speakers horrible learners . ( explain why gaelic has taken opposite trend started marking vowel length where never used , since is used much nowadays less fully native speakers . . . ) . thoughts hypotheses gratefully received . back korean . . . still seems unusual situation . seems likely indeed was suggested korean respondents original hangul did length marker , found evidence research hangul . ( 's why posted orginal query , ve had another ledyard 's thesis topic . ) maybe need careful research : pointers gratefully received . couple points clarification : distinction between monosyllabic vowel length ' minimal pairs ' does seem dying ( though is fact previously existed was marked writing system odd ; lack orthographic representation contributes demise ? ? ) . is clear distinction sound two syllable pairs . ears distinction seems much one pitch accent length . : said native speakers dont easily identify vowel length , didnt mean ' language doesnt vowel length distinction ' - indeed statement cautious ! meant dont word is supposed long vowel short . is consistent information sent native speakers is something taught schools prescriptive rule anyone has read far , let reward sharing response fran karttunen ( hope doesnt mind ) . dont exactly interpret respect questions above , ' m sure 's something us ! ' both maya nahua ( speakers unrelated mesoamerican languages ) had achieved partially-syllabic approach writing before arrival europeans first quarter 16th century . tell writing , both made rhebus principles drawing thing , name was similar rather identical , was used suggest intended word / syllable . instance , drawing bare bottom ( tzin-tli " buttocks " ) was used honorific suffix - tzin . likewise drawing banner , pan-tli was used locative - pan . two examples are suffixes , are similar cases initial syllables nahuatl noun stems , instance . vowel length , least nahuatl , is taken account cases . honorific suffix today has reflex long vowel most modern dialects nahuatl , making homophonous stem " buttocks " , attestation sixteenth century consistently show contrast vowel length ( short honorific , long " buttocks " ) . same " banner " ( long vowel ) versus locative ( short ) .
