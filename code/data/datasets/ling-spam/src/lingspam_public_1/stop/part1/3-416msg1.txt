( gary marcus colleagues mit monograph is yet . ) children tend produce here , least statistically . 2 ) assumption is made , absence data , children rarely hear adults produce sentences ( 1a ) above . is amazing claim , doubt is true . 3 ) even were true , wyngaerd is making generalizations learning absence theory learning . two things are unfortunately common . why 's ok , " 's data , were , ' m sure x " , expect seriously ? " theory learning , ' m sure n't predict x " ? ' m phonologist , n't kept changes syntactic theory , ' m sure n't allowed away statements " reasonable formal theory syntax , did , ' m sure n't accommodate subj-aux inversion , theories formal syntax must wrong " . statement is different kind ones . one statement implicit much work linguistics : " theory genetics , ontogeny , evolutionary biology , ' m sure did , modern linguistic assumptions innateness fit real . " maybe ask bit ourselves often . - - - joe stemberger
