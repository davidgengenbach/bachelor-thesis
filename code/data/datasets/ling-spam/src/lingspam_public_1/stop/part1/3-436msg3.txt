" n't copy " origin species " here , can't real quote , above lines remind forcefully problem early evolutionary biologists faced , one darwin was painfully aware . darwin had " theory genetics , " fact current ideas genetics made precisely wrong predictions evolution . ( was thought trait simply blended already existing traits , instead remaining discreet inheritable trait . ) was n't until mendel 's work heredity was rediscovered ( 1930 's , recall correctly ) theory evolution had explaining why newly developed traits were lost population single water drop lost ocean . history science is full theories appear fatal flaws , theories are accepted anyway , faith explanation turn later . ( another example is idea planets revolve around sun space , rather being attached crystal spheres rotate around earth . earth : - ) holds orbits ? ) stemberger writes : > ' ve never understood why makes difference linguistic > theory whether highly language-specific information is innate . > > yes , makes lot difference e . g . language acquisition , 's > beyond scope most linguists .
