thursday night , 21 , zellig harris died sleep after pleasant working day . was 88 years old . was born 1904 byelorussia . am told chose name zellig sabbettai family immigrated united states was four . semantics happiness steadfastness were mind . certainly were keynotes life . guess parents chose name harris . died , was finishing book politics had been planning most life . 1992 publication book _ theory language information _ ( oxford ) , had wrapped life 's work language , least being . seems felt liberty unfinished business . understand paul mattick , jr . , was harris 's friend neighbor many years york , book describes capitalism socialism . is surely conventional either capitalism socialism , harris was anarchist . oxford was interested publishing , had talked cambridge . is memorial planned , beyond something private family . however , is discussion beginning public meeting scientific content . hope festschrift haj ross called lsa meetings years ago might being . harris described himself methodologist rather linguist . misleading . always said work was part linguistics is institutionally defined , linguists interested work , though interested language . nonetheless , was surely linguist most operational definitions one might . had done extensive fieldwork variety language . was doing final revision 1992 oxford book , undertook test theory language against every language had control , 44 languages . spent months reading grammars morning night , evaluating whether theory had reasonable account found . was clear scientific conclusions were warranted , particular notice check is given book , wanted feel reasonably secure conclusions were idiosyncratic english , french , german , korean , few languages had been primary bases development . was pleased results . contributions field were numerous weighty . founded first linguistics department u . s . introduced algebraic representations abstract mathematical treatment become much norms field is difficult appreciate much did over kicking screaming protests peers . invented x - bar notation immediate constituent analysis , though course name , cope known weakness ic analysis head-of relation . developed ways accomodate discontinuous morphemes grammatical analysis . charted difficulties experienced bloch others phonology , saying contrast rather phonetic identity is basis setting phonemes , ghost has risen haunt generative phonology once . invented string analysis complement ( rival ) immediate constituent analysis . complementarity respect head-of problem is basis joshi 's tree - adjoining grammars ( tags ) . invented transformational analysis context developing discourse analysis information content texts . contributions await recognition exploitation field linguistics institutionalized today , fields . obvious examples include sublanguage analysis sublanguage grammar , operator grammar based word dependency , discourse analysis information content , theory information account central aspect semantics . example , string grammar natural extension transformational grammar is basis successful work naomi sager others nyu information formatting sublanguage texts , applied mainly medical informatics . stephen johnson has implemented system representing information content texts , based operator grammar . successes sort are little noticed within linguistics . is characteristic harris was vanity self importance . knew work was lasting importance , treated , was guru empire builder seeking followers , accept role being projected onto . those students sought entree linguistics social institution academia were bound disappointed . however , scarcely blamed disappointment . did provide entree , nor did pretend , hearing actively discouraged students imagined work further ambitions field . once , role ta john fought , prepared lecture harris 's approach syntax semantics . were setting lecture hall , encountered harris , blurted " ' m lecture theory john 's class . " ( john , characteristic wry humor , asked wanted anything back . ) harris bemusedly questioned whether anyone interested was doing . nonetheless , gave public lecture " two structures language : report paraphrase " 1969 1970 , large auditorium ( was furness building ) was filled capacity , critique john corcoran , published later volume _ transformationelle analyse _ edited senta ploetz , was attended . broad attendance acclaim work easily been , had chosen . is simply where ambitions lay . clue basis choice against fame influence perhaps found advice student starting first teaching position , many years ago . n't invite anybody over dinner , said , n't accept invitations . involved social life academic , won't able work done . work came first . harris was always intensely loyal man friends family . consequences , combined laissez-faire anarchism , were always happy . friend close colleague many years , henry hiz , was much concerned building formal linguistics program institution . disparity character devastating students . studied harris 1966 through 1970 . was undergraduate much , did matter . had sink-or - swim approach attributed sapir ( darnell 1990 ) , except seminars were course focussed theory rather data , , athabaskan . seminar start talking was working . started , was work resulted 1968 book , _ mathematical structures language _ ( wiley ) . process was lecture monologue , continuing conversation students , trying alternatives , posing working problems mathematical characterization language . after while , intensive reading outside , one began catch participate . recall telling end one seminar meeting first try disprove theory . troubled bit . worked problem modern greek thought might troublesome approach . ( had lived greece couple years , spoke language , worked informant project . ) results turned actually corroborate point had intended challenge , merely thanked data greek . two later , had proposal analyze definitions dictionary extract semantic primitives form componential analysis , much martha evens others done . although notion semantic features seems inimical concept method work , said ( is exact quote ) " others tried failed , are welcome try . " offer refutation sometimes heard view harris was dictatorial . ran conflicts matters hiz , never harris . heard asked why never retorted attacks work . did matter . did expect methods results understood taken everyone field linguistics . maybe attitude differed 1940s , wrote structural restatements manuscript eventually published _ methods structural linguistics _ . ( btw , title was said " descriptive " publisher substituted buzzword " structural . " recall saying , amusedly , " n't remember whether asked . " ) maybe expectations field changed after chomsky 's followers began making bad guy . n't , based writings testimony were students . never heard comment commonplace attribution chomsky discovery transformational grammar " transformational revolution . " is passage _ state art _ ( 1968 ) hockett attributes harris " nothing , long silence , after 1957 , " showing ignorance things string analysis , might excused , even ignoring 1965 paper transformational theory prominently published _ language _ . showed passage harris , shrugged . did matter . particular , never saw evidence harris opposed blocked chomsky 's ambitions . experience been entirely character . example , was harris proposed chomsky speak stead 1962 international congress . similar canard regarding bernard bloch has recently been laid rest editorial language . one must alert social psychology leads rewrite history avatar is depicted embattled hero . , old indian friend once told one cannot point finger without having three fingers same hand pointing back , hasten add is picture intend paint here harris . accomplished intended quite , thank much , seems been quite happy process . point is precisely seemed embattled attacks uncomprehending misconstruals work . uncomprehending misconstruals abound . frawley 's review _ grammar english mathematical principles _ ( gemp ) is example . identifies harris 's operator grammar predicate calculus , though harris is pains delineate critical differences between language ( fortiori operator grammar ) language-like mathematical systems , including predicate calculus . frawley comprehensive grammar attempt 1960s generative grammar 1980 , is unable step generativist paradigm understand harris 's work own terms . another review ( eric wheeler , 1984 _ computers humanities _ ) asserted harris 's grammar was unable account certain familiar semantic problems - - middle voice , semantics vs . seek , quantifier scope examples " someone was opposed everyone . " review ( _ computational linguistics _ 1984 ) showed harris did fact account each problems book . michael kac , review harris 's selected writings , asked " why bother ? " indeed , within generativist paradigm must plausible question . is setting aside paradigmatic blinkers one , having writings one place , consistent self coherent harris 's program has been over years . transformational grammar was revolutionary break part continuous evolution . mention one misconception harris 's work , is fundamental is commonplace . probably greeted disbelief discovery procedures were aim . ( jim mccawley 's witticism harris discovery procedures collection traditionally circulated really reverses roles teller butt joke . ) is hard linguists mistaken belief . discovery procedures are abiding fixture linguistics institutionally defined . _ methods _ was published , linguists sought aid fieldwork writing linguistic descriptions . , discovery procedures are institutionalized whipping boy . has colored perceptions harris 's intentions results . harris , was certainly interest value redundancy one level linguistic representation used practical determine boundaries objects next , was corroborative byproduct , aim . " constructional procedure " described 1955 paper phoneme morpheme was implemented fortran early 1960s proven work , ralph grishman has had preliminary success implementing programs discover word classes rules sublanguage grammar sublanguage texts . general harris did discovery procedures were feasible . particular , told thought grammatical analysis done solely corpus asking informants , one had control language oneself . one had work over data tease pattern wrestle coherent form , lengthy demanding process , probably most us experience . much popularized image feeding corpus , turning crank , having grammar reel end . introduction _ methods structural linguistics _ , harris states clearly methods are discovery procedures . accepts one uses many means proposals describing is going language - - hunches , guesses , heuristic rules thumb , typological generalizations , proposed universals , comparison related languages earlier stages language , , art science ( rather , art engineering ) . harris was acutely aware danger swamping one 's control language growing familiarity marginal examples . language is after social institution , continuously change is constantly recreated crucible . aim methods was substitute informal ways coming possible analyses , verify , given result , whether result had valid relation data language . those actually read book , many said ( fact said ) " did n't really mean . " nothing else , harris was always careful exactly meant . concern verification arises deeper concern becomes explicit harris 's later work . is critical point linguistics . science , is standpoint external science domain metascience . particular , practitioners physics , chemistry , even mathematics , rely " background vernacular " language ensure communication shared meanings ultimately validate relation conclusions , however reached , observations are based . science language . harris recognized accepted is vantage point outside language describe language . , observably , each language contains own metalanguage . ' ll repeat , is key understanding harris was , is easy overlook importance . is vantage point outside language describe language . contrast , generativist theory postulates universal metalanguage , external language , is part one 's biological endowment . ( personally biologicist , neophrenologist doctrine mental organs credible , issue rests opinion facts yet determined . ) stance seems perfectly consonant argument made stephen anderson " why phonology is n't natural . " one cannot derive linguistic structure findings study bearing metascience relation linguistics . harris was interested language carry transmit information , is thread underlies really remarkable consistency work over 50 years . intuitively , differences form correlate differences meaning , correlation is messy inconsistent observed data language ( , body writings phonemic transcriptions , including whatever utterances investigator ad hoc search examples ) . harris found was messy , inconsistent stream words product two concurrent systems : system word dependencies correlates perceptions subject-matter domain science subfield , system reductions changes word shapes ( often zero ) , motivated part issues redundancy efficiency part historically contingent social convention . reductions introduce degeneracies ambiguity paraphrase , otherwise obscure correlation form meaning , without destroying correlation . given structure ( differences form ) correlates meaning , is critical importance machinery description import structure extraneous found language . harris 's endeavor was always , , determine " least grammar , " description required absolute minimum primitive objects relations . additional objects relations description introduce extrinsic structure obscures informational structure language . basis telling critique various theories language . harris chose critique . asked once certain aspects generativist theory , comment , evidence mild amusement , did seem over-structured . teacher , sapir , harris had interest problems international communication international auxiliary language . ( paper appeared 1962 volume avoiding world war iii . remember wwiii , everyone ? ) sapir bloomfield had particular long standing interest international cooperation communication science . culminated _ form information science : analysis immunology sublanguage _ ( michael gottfried , tom ryckman , others , 1989 , john benjamins ) . book describes grammar sublanguage immunology during specific period development field , based discourse analysis sublanguage texts period adequate making explicit information structures arbitrary texts sublanguage . analysis shows structure sublanguage changed concurrently change immunologists ' perceptions domain science . difference informational structure correlates difference meaning . informational structures are clearly represented binary array resulting discourse analysis are still present actual form source texts written albeit obscured under reductions word shape , motivated considerations informational efficiency avoidance redundancy , dictated conventions language human social institution . harris arranged life enhance autonomy work . understand kibbutz israel is wealthy one , members assets income , turn supports needs . believe kibbutz purchased apartment building charles street . until retirement , held endowed chair penn , benjamin franklin professorship linguistics . was principal investigator long series grants nsf , nimh , agencies whose committees referees found work continuing value . throughout life was involved scientists science . wife was physicist university jerusalem , had been albert einstein 's assistant princeton . brother was immunologist ( is author work analyzed 1989 book ) . felt rough tumble polemic attack retort was inappropriate science , participate . too distraction work . after one bampton lectures columbia 1986 , young member audience approached asked had another lifetime before . mentioned poetry , especially longer works 19th century poets browning . mentioned music . mentioned sign language . had long productive life . had brought life 's work successful culmination . completion book politics , imagine death coming , chess playing knight seventh seal , saying " ok , ' m ready .
