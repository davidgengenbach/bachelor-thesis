Subject: sum : dets number

month ago , posted following query : ' m looking languages whose nps following three properties : ( 1 ) bare , unmarked nouns occur argument position , interpreted either singular plural ( eg . malay , mandarin , japanese , opposed english ) ; ( 2 ) least determiners are unmarked number ( eg . english " " , " " , " john 's " , opposed " " , " " ) ; , most interestingly , ( 3 ) bare , unmarked noun occurs construction determiner is unmarked number , resulting np * is * marked number . far , am familiar two languages satisfying above three conditions . ( both are singaporean dialects languages whose standard varieties n't satisfy conditions . ) singaporean malay ( 1 ) standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked number , eg . " kucing " ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) again standard malay , determiners " itu " ( / ) ini " ( ) are unmarked number , eg . " seekor kucing itu " ( / one cat ) , " dua ekor kucing itu " ( those / two cats ) ; ( 3 ) unlike standard malay , bare , unmarked nouns construction " itu " ini " tend interpreted singular , eg . " kucing itu " ( / cat / ? * cats ) . [ apparently , is variation here between speakers , between different constructions same speakers . ] singlish ( aka colloquial singaporean english ) ( 1 ) unlike standard english , bare , unmarked nouns are unmarked number , eg . " cat " ( cat / cats ) ; ( 2 ) standard english , prenominal possessors " john 's " are unmarked number , eg . " john 's one cat " ( john 's one cat ) , " john 's two cat ( s ) " ( john 's two cats ) ; ( 3 ) bare , unmarked nouns are preceded prenominal possessors , resulting construction interpreted singular , eg . " john 's cat " ( john 's cat / * cats ) . questions : ( ) is anybody familiar examples ? ( references ? ) ( b ) is southeast asian areal feature / common cross-linguistic pattern ? ( c ) both above cases , unmarked noun plus unmarked determiner results singular np . are cases where result is plural np ? ( d ) does anybody ideas analyze / explain phenomenon ( within theoretical framework , none ) ? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * is one case where summary is much shorter query itself . two languages emerged pattern identical singaporean malay : japanese ( thanks pamela downing mayumi masuko ) , korean ( thanks jae jung song ) . ( meantime , further field work own revealed singlish , prenominal possessors definite article " " exhibits similar singularity effect : although unmarked number ( evidenced " one cat " , " two cat ( s ) " ) , " cat " is interpreted singular . ) further observations were provided steven berbeco , richard dearmond , bob fradkin , mark . mandel , edith . moravcsik , gwyn williams .
