fritz newmeyer raises important issues typological research instantiated nichols ' work elsewhere , call comments . first , notion language type is idealization : is often made clear typology courses , where non-existent artificial languages are considered logically possible impossible language types , always published literature ( though point is clearly made comrie 's textbook , example , discussion morphological typology ) . similarly , fritz is quite right point assumption areal genetic bias , extent is made , is counterfactual one . ask is whether idealizations differ kind those , many counterfactual , underlie generative grammar . justification is similar both cases : methodologically , one cannot deal relevant variables , concepts used are logically independent extrinsic variables , e . g . one investigate consistency proposed implicational universals regardless statistical bias one 's sample . term ` shaky typological pigeon-holing ' is particularly inapt applied nichols ' distinction between head-marking dependent - marking languages , is quite explicitly matter degree ( 1986 paper where degree hm vs . dm is quantifified terms number patterns instantiating each type ) . nichols refers ` head-marking language ' is shorthand quantifiable tendency , might describe italian ` pro-drop language ' without implying is binary distinction here ( fact are degrees pro-drop , e . g . languages allow null expletives null referential subjects , etc ) . another point typologists accept is languages n't appear match established type are typological data - example , colloquial french discussed recently linguist is language might reasonably described having basic word order ( believe nichols classified vso one tables , is again shorthand complex situation ) . is explanandum nichols ' 1986 paper offers explanation : head-marking facilitates word order freedom , colloquial french instantiates clausal head-marking nichols ' sense . sum : pace widespread opinion , typologists ' goal is pigeon-holing ( " taxonomy " is widely used context ! ) investigation explanation patterns variation . steve matthews
