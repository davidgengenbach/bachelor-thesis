" is ( paper 's authors wallace , torroni schurr , et al . ) said . authors did address themselves linguistic problems most certainly did n't talk " subgroups " . nor did , since regard historicity anything " amerind " even remotely established . authors paper did posit least four " migrations " . discuss most recent , eskomo - aleut , abstract , gave depth figure 6000 years bp ( before present ) orally - - n't quote . abstract : call na - dene figure is 7000-10000 years bp . evidence least two " migrations " preceding . one comes between 12000-15000 bp earliest between 26000-34000 bp . figures high 40000 bp were mentioned orally , recall . did attempt correlate figures our knowledge periods glaciation periodic existence land bridge beringia . leave readers decide portends amerind hypo - thesis proposed ( glotto ) chronology , warning is order event . note written " migration " quotes above . is wish pejorate term ; is geneticists special . has solely ap - pearance specific genetic material american populations . assume common ancestor calculate number millennia positing uniform mutation rate mtdna . material theories work force definition migration . says nothing situation " ground .
