Subject: re : sapir - whorf tell students days

here 's tell undergrad grad students same chapter language files . . e . , 's difficult even judge 's going whorf unless are simultaneously conversant linguistics , american indian languages , least insights modern physics . first , conclusion is appropriate is , showed " demise whorf hypothesis " ( berkeley linguistics society , 1978 ? ) , whorf said has little generally relation whatever entire body discussion comes under name " ( sapir - ) whorf hypothesis " . showed decades before critics came own hypotheses , failed name after themselves , never agreed characterization thoughts . simple test : read lf chapter ask , " created whorf hypothesis ? " quick answer is : did whorf himself call two three references ? called " principle linguistic relativity " " linguistic relativity principle " . own reading whorf never finds word " hypothesis " . - - right off bat , is teach scientific nomenclature , turned whorf 's ' principle ' ( n ) ' hypothesis ' , why ? was n't whorf , designation was clear . is difference between two ? , principle is axiom geometry : starting point is theoretically unverifiable - - 's starting point . want something else , begin different starting point , develop hypotheses . next : does whorf 's " linguistic relativity principle " , anything , einstein 's " relativity principle " ( covered bls , 1980 ? , paper , " is whorf 's relativity einstein 's relativity ? " ) . ah , ' ve gotten crux - - much against pinker 's stand ( was copied intensified lingua franca short bio suzette elgin hayden recently , where digression found author saying whorf cobbled together theory few ill-translated snatches apache - - echoing pinker statement relying pinker 's quoting whorf correctly , did n't , canoe beach pointwise : pinker identified apache sentence , whorf knew quite was nootka pacific northwest rather apache beachless desert ) , whorf was upping ante einstein , argued euclidian geometry , far being universal , was applicable flat surfaces ; round surfaces , most reality is made , need non - euclidian geometry . . e . , phenomena change significantly , change tool ' re using . , 's whorf said too ( heisenberg 's lament below ) , except moved domain mathematics natural human language ; hence : truly aptly named " principle linguistic relativity " whorf himself named . admittedly , does n't sense until action , " american indian model universe , " where posits worldview without our tense / ( past / present / future diorama river ) , using manifested / manifesting ( plus synonyms ) instead . is : sae grammars / cultures aforementioned notion " " , is supported maintained tense systems ( though , admittedly , english is weird gets through culture side language / culture system ) ; hopi language / culture system has image , working different worldview principle sees cyclical , linear , - - round , flat . most world 's grammars broken latinate mold show particular / tense system sae is pretty much peculiar western european languages - - hence linguistic / cultural ontology " " practice , supposed universal fondly believed . side note : one reads whorf closely , makes five ten times universalist statements relativity statements writings , yet is seen ( reviled chomskyan universalist attitude ) relativist par excellent . right get-go 1 ) whorf did n't write n't agree hypothesis someone ( s ) named after ; 2 ) rather being deranged crackpot , was merely literate : whorf was one few interdisciplinary thinkers between physics linguistics century ; 3 ) whorf 's relativity principle had something important einstein 's ; 4 ) whorf was universalist relativist - - had balance , notable enough rarity current academe , must admit . bold , alluding posting " one has disproved whorf 's mild version linguistic relativity ( let 's leave ling . determinism aside , stronger version . ) " , even mild version was n't ! trace back did whorf espoused neither strong nor weak versions determinism , relativity has nothing determinism physics viewpoint above , did . read carefully , writers whorf hypothesis admit even whorf did n't hold strong version determinism ( did n't , did ? nobody did , why bring ? ) , critics hold weak version dreamed ( even though whorf n't hold 's least weakly deterministic therefore newtonian ) . 's going ? problem is whorf had already , acquaintance physics , moved newtonian monocausal determinism ideal systems thinking - - where sometimes opposite one profound truth is another profound truth , where everything is interdependent , multicausal , interconnected : language shapes culture while culture is shaping language ; language shapes thinking while thinking is shaping language . cumulative effect ( humboldt / boas / sapir - ) whorf hypothesis literature has been primarily throw smokescreen around ideas , including grad students linguistics , psychology , anthropology sociology , won't read original ( english ! ) . tell grad students want really discipline is , discipline is beating read ; are lucky someone four major academic disciplines are ganging - - ' ve hit goldmine ! world important four academic disciplines create combined smokescreen ? few linguists century availed themselves changes thinking reality physics has been broadcasting during entire century , few linguists are even qualified step did n't realize was interdisciplinary debate history ideas whorf felt comfortable . ' ll explain . ' ll synopsis talk intend 100th birthday conference benjamin whorf , intend funding hold bay area spring 1997 . call " heisenberg 's lament . " , early century , ' uncertain ' heisenberg was among first gain ' glimpse ' subatomic world ; , having done , rendered opinion , regarding subatomic realm , " reached limits our language . " said two reasons : 1 ) matter glibly western scientists talk electrons , protons , neutrons , quarks , etc . , realm are ' things ' , processes relationships ; order sense ( . e . , complete sentences ) sae languages , need nouns - - 's nothing subatomic realm , except willy-nilly , attach nouns . 2 ) given , our most fundamental scientific terms " same " " different " are useless . did n't , physics does n't , whether are gazillions electrons one electron gazillions manifestations . reached limits our language . fast - forward few decades whorf hears physics classes yale ( has unpublished manuscripts gravity yale archives ) , ponders : hm , wonder has anything prof . sapir said day hopi needing nouns express ordinary propositions - - " rehpi " , " flashed " , instead " " " / light flashed " : right down , is flashing different light ? is " light " convenient grammatical fiction foisted upon us sae grammar ? pondered ' light ' being noun verb , particle wave , depending 's viewed , saw universe same , different cultures taking different positions question . case , since hopi did n't seem too seriously absence nouns , perhaps , whorf surmised , hopi physicists exploring reporting back quantum world , realm did n't thingy nouns . fast - forward another few decades physicist david bohm reads whorf ( confirmed personally talking ) , , * response * ( attribution ) , writes _ wholeness implicate order _ , , among things , tries english verby performative " rheomode " - - brilliant flop ; launches scientific community view universe does contain our familiar notions past / present / future , instead implicate explicate order reality - - " inny / outty " notion where future is inside us working outward instead vague distant goal are headed toward . email acquaintance pointedly asked difference was between bohm 's terminology whorf 's terminology ; took 6 months finally answer was none , except hopis had had theirs millennia longer . hit ! bohm , own maverick , appropriated whorf 's answer heisenberg 's lament " american indian model universe " substituted scientifically acceptable terminology ( implicate / explicate rather manifesting / manifested ) notion universe without linear fly modern physics academic community - - had qualified success . - - bohm was closer knowing whether whorf had been accurate description hopi had been before writing book . had been much bad press guy ! was one , ultimately ? here 's part almost no-one knows far . 1991 , few months life , david bohm launched most ambitious thought experiment date : physicists few psychologists linguists , sponsored fetzer institute , enticed recognized american indian intellectual leaders ( elders ) join dialogue together describe roundabout asking american indians whether whorf was accurate description ' timeless ' hopi worldview . became much ! american indian leaders had previously read bohm 's book others , physicists knew nothing native american worldviews native american science methodologies , indians had build bridge over private meetings before three public days themes , space language . during day , whorf 's description hopi came , was read loud , discussed , though n't remember hopis being present ; nevertheless , american indians present , mostly algonquian tribes , gave called ' independent verification ' scientific terminology saying essentially : , can't speak hopi , 's pretty much . fact , many whorf passages read discussed dialogues , physicists american indians present were usually willing whorf points ( proving again , perhaps , difficulty being prophet one 's own country / discipline ! ) . ' re done yet - - best is yet - - actual conclusion heisenberg 's lament ! beginning first dialogue was clear quantum physicists had favorite realm explore talk , american indians had own favorite realm . dialogued , began becoming clear those favorite realms had fundamental principles common : constant is flux ; everything exists vibrates ; everything is interconnected part implicates whole . fact , became crystal clear major obstacle realms being same realm was really terminological : physicists are used calling " subatomic realm " whereas american indians millennia been calling " spirit realm " . 's big enough surprise - - modern physics is knocking door spirit without really meaning - - big enough , let 's home ! puzzled physicists american indians foreknowledge realm n't , western scientific infrastructure had recently led us - - indians had scientific infrastructure ! physicists gradually understood , hopi , algonquian grammatical structures demand nouns , demand fictitious actors embody actions ( , mikmaq blackfoot friends tell , talk day long those languages never utter single ' noun ' ! ) , finally had admit languages were indeed much better suited exploring realm reporting back sae languages - - whorf 's reply heisenberg 's lament was verified agreed upon . phenomena reality change dramatic , need change tool ' re using . , course , physicists were left even larger puzzle , wit : is american indians language much better suited sae languages investigate describe inner workings subatomic realm - - realm are n't even supposed ! ? ! , pinker - - facile critics unindicted co-creators so-called hypothesis - - is league altogether attempting characterize major player one most important interdisciplinary discussions ever history ideas . pinker , chomsky , loves logic ( grows grammar sae languages philosophy ' karma ' grew grammar ancient sanskrit , where was used earliest linguistics term 'd irect object ' ! ! ) , has never really gotten program century replace binary / dualistic thinking multivariable / multicausal / interdependent systems thinking . whorf heard call , back , yet prove been entire century ahead linguistics . even though systems phonology grammar , tough doing " language thought " ; feel bipolar opposites are distinct one causes invariantly ; 's why admired slobin finally lost those monolithic terms framed question instead terms " thinking speaking " - - least one kind thinking where thinking is much mercy forms categories language , per whorf . tell students , , bottom whorf did did is read essays _ language , thought & reality _ themselves , perhaps above thoughts guideline , figure themselves whether sapir - whorf hypothesis smokescreen makes sense .
