call papers tilburg university conference derivational residue phonology 1 - 7 october 1995 grammatical models group tilburg university plans organize conference derivational residue phonology . conference hope discuss topics were dealt standard generative phonology derivational means level ordering , ( strict ) cyclicity rule ordering , light recent shift attention towards theories are representational nature . derivational tools mentioned replaced representational instruments ? , ` optimal ' representational theory ? cannot , exactly is residue derivationalism still need ? invite papers related topics ( complete description conference topic found below ) both against purely representational approaches phonology . expect able ( partially ) reimburse travelling expenses lodging our speakers . furthermore are proud bruce hayes geert booij already agreed our invited speakers . deadline those interested presenting paper ( 40 minutes talks , 15 minutes discussion ) send 5 copies two page abstract ( 10 anonymous ; 1 camera-ready , name ( s ) , affiliation ( s ) contact address , including e-mail ) : marc van oostendorp ben hermans , grammaticamodellen , tilburg university , postbus 90153 , 5000 le , tilburg , netherlands . abstracts must received 1 1995 . abstracts page text considered too condensed read rejected without review . email submissions accepted . additional information contact b . j . h . hermans @ kub . nl m . voostendorp @ kub . nl . topic conference during past few years main focus attention phonology seems been shifted derivational representational models , prince smolensky 's optimality theory , goldsmith 's harmonic phonology burzio 's pes - model . yet generative phonologists accumulated substantial evidence derivational analysis . standard lexical phonology , instance , derivationalism plays role several ways : model is divided lexical postlexical component , lexical component itself is divided several lexical levels , lexical levels are cyclic every affix starts own cycle , finally , phonologicals rule within every cycle are ordered . question is evaluate derivational instruments representational theory phonology . distinction between lexical postlexical phonology seems least controversial . most optimality theory analyses seem accept least remnant derivationalism . yet one imagine radical version purely representational theory distinction between word-level phrasal phonology is accounted appropriate theory phonological domains . case , question remains evaluate traditional criteria lexical-postlexical distinction ( exceptions , sensitivity morphological syntactic boundaries , etc . ) theory constraints constraint ranking . similar questions asked internal level ordering within lexical component . analyses used framed terms lexical levels reframed representational terms ? extent theory makes extensive lexical levels still called ` representational ' ? most discussion derivationalism within optimality theory seems been concentrated issue cyclicity . has been demonstrated cyclic analyses replaced adequate theory alignment between phonological morphological structure . is everything needs said issue ? are , instance , cyclic versions ot feasible desirable ? similarily , considerable effort has been put several researchers showing strict cyclicity theoretical concept is superfluous replaced theory underspecification . whether is adequate answer derived environment effects is another topic hope address . finally , expect even finest grained level derivationalism , viz . phonological rule ordering ( both intrinsic extrinsic ) interesting questions remain unanswered . particular cases used known counter-feeding counter-bleeding relations seem us still open discussion . questions considerable conceptual import , yet seems us ultimately answered empirically . issue derivationalism is one interesting challenges optimality theory models mentioned earlier pose . hope receive many abstracts dealing .
