" is european union funded project ( copernicus ' 93 project . 10393 ) whose aim is embed spoken natural language synthesis technology sophisticated user interfaces order improve access information systems . multimedia technology knowledge-based text processing enhance development types information systems offer references full-text documents user provide access images , graphics , audio video documents . diversification formation offered has supported easy-to - multimodal user interfaces , are capable presenting each type information item perceived processed effectively user . users easily process simultaneously graphical medium information presentation linguistic medium . separation mode is quite appropriate different functionalities main graphical interaction supportive meta-dialogue carried linguistically . believe , therefore , substantial improvement both functionality user acceptance is achieved integration spoken languages capabilities . however , text-to - speech devices commercially available today produce speech sounds unnatural is hard listen . high quality synthesized speech sounds acceptable humans demands appropriate intonation patterns . effective control intonation requires synthesizing meanings , rather word sequences , requires understanding functions intonation . domain sophisticated human-machine interfaces , increasing tendency design interfaces independent agents themselves engage interactive dialogue ( both graphical linguistic ) users . agents need maintain models discourses , users , communicative goals . speak ! project , was launched recently cooperation between speech research technology laboratory technical university budapest technical university darmstadt ( cooperation gmd-ipsi ) , aims developing interface multimedia retrieval system . ipsi , departments komet ( natural language generation ) mind ( information retrieval dialogues ) contribute project . project is construct proof-of - concept prototype multimodal information system combining graphical spoken language output variety languages . work involves four supporting goals : first , advance state art domains speech synthesis , spoken text generation , graphical interface design ; second , provide enabling technology higher functionality information systems are appropriate general public ; third , significantly improve public industrial acceptance speech synthesis general hungarian text-to - speech technology elaborated within project particular ; , fourth , act focusing point speech work hungary . contact points : gmd / ipsi , darmstadt : john bateman e-mail : bateman @ gmd . de fax : + 49 / 6151-869 - 818 tel : + 49 / 6151-869 - 826 tu - budapest : g ' eza n ' emeth e-mail : nemeth @ ttt - 202 . ttt . bme . hu fax : + 36 / 1-463 - 3107 tel : + 36 / 1-463 2401
