Subject: sycophants : fig " show-ers " ?

n't much etymology , : several readers claimed _ sicophant _ is derived greek words ' fig ' ( sikos ) 's ' ( phaino : ) . first part is surely correct , second seems problematic , since relevant participle forms _ phaino : _ present _ phainont - _ aorist _ phanont - _ . without greek grammar dictionary hand , suggest rather athematic greek verb _ phe : mi _ ( doric _ pha : mi ) 's peak ' , does participle _ phant - _ . maybe sicophant is ' fig-talker ' rather ' fig-shower ' . semantic connection , course , words were sweet ear ; certainly sicophants sweet-talking fig-showing . ? has etymology been proposed ? has been proposed rejected , why ? leo . connolly foreign languages & literatures university memphis connolly @ msuvax . memphis . edu formerly " memphis state university "
