wish comments issue recent discussion nostratic problem " demonstrating " distant genetic relationships has skirted around believe underlies issues various been directly addressing . assumption seems underly much discussion is hypotheses regarding genetic relationships are interesting unless proven true . rather odd assumption , one does seem made kinds hypotheses linguistics ( anywhere else science far ) . let us set aside sake argument oft-noted point notion proof is really applicable empirical hypotheses , assume term is used loosely arbitrary high level certainty . seems fair is fairly widespread disinterest hypotheses nostratic hypothesis is widely believed ( assume is true here sake argument ) available evidence nostratic falls short imaginary level certainty deserves label " proven " . common type reaction unproven hypotheses is has been demonstrated observed similarities might due chance / borrowing . suppose someone were same attitude towards comparative reconstruction protolanguages . suppose someone were object comparative reconstruction anything shallow groups grounds one never prove reconstructions are correct . one object certain claims genetic relationships grounds one cannot conclusively eliminate possibility observed similarities might due accident / borrowing , one equally object virtually hypotheses surrounding comparative reconstruction grounds one cannot conclusively eliminate alternative possibilities . comparative method is best guess one protolanguage ; never provides proof reconstruction is fact correct . why bother doing ? answer obvious : hypotheses represent our best guesses point are much science is . why many linguists seem object applying same thinking hypotheses genetic relationships ? why is many historical linguists hypotheses nostratic hypothesis either laughable upsetting ? why n't react same comparative reconstructions , since are " unproven " ? why n't rush read everything nostratic conclude " evidence is tantalizing conclusive ; 's really exciting hypothesis " ? why is double standard ? want suggest answer question , answer , right , provides insight nature many debates surrounding controversial hypotheses genetic relationship . namely , questions genetic classification intrinsically interesting , quite apart detailed historical work plays role supporting hypotheses . , however , are primarily interested detailed historical work itself , questions genetic classification intrinsically interesting , interesting far are inevitable consequence historical work . first sort are likely recent work reclassifying penutian languages exciting , while latter sort are unlikely react , unless are penutian specialists . one moves back , ability apply comparative method becomes increasingly difficult , detailed historical work becomes increasingly speculative ( many historical linguists , dissatisfying ) . depth , always much confident genetic classification comparative reconstructions . our confidence indo - european language family is surely greater our confidence specific claims proto - indo - european . move further back , expect hypotheses cannot entirely confident , is least promising evidence , where comparative reconstruction is going sufficiently speculative satisfying linguists interested traditional comparative work . since linguists are interested genetic classification except biproduct detailed historical work , linguists are likely hypotheses uninteresting . hand , linguists questions genetic classification inherently interesting , fact detailed historical work possible is irrelevant , fact hypothesis is unproven unprovable source concern fact comparative reconstructions are always unproven unprovable . view is correct , much debate surrounding controversial hypotheses genetic classification is based , substantive questions , simply sorts questions different interesting . matthew dryer
