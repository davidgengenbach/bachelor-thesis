here are explanations three famous types auto-antonymy . bob fradkin gives us auto-antonymy verbs covering / uncovering , chuck bigelow follows english blackening indo - european ' white ' , david gamon explores modal expressions mean opposite . * * * bob fradkin ( raf100f @ oduvm . cc . odu . edu ) writes : dust is part series noun-verb conversions related coverings things . noun gives covering is natural thing , verb means " remove covering . " covering is imposed , verb means " put covering . " " shell egg " " peel banana " " paint furniture " " wax floor . " dust is interesting either : " dust furniture " ( sort natural covering removed ) vs . " dust crops " ( put stuff did n't n't unless humans put ) . mentioned english grammar book " stalking wild verb phrase " ( univ . pr . america 1991 ) end chp . 3 . * * * chuck bigelow ( bigelow @ cs . stanford . edu ) writes : ) historical linguistics , known example word 's meaning shifting opposite is english " black " , indo - european root is * bhel - ' shine , flash , burn , white ' etc . another modern reflex * bhel is " bald " - ' having shining white head ' . variant * bhel - , * bhelg - / * bhleg - ' shine , burn ' comes germanic * blakaz ' burned ' , thence old english " blaec " - ' black , has been burned ' . nifty . ( ' m using calvert watkins ' dictionary ie roots , houghton mifflin , reference . ) * * * david gamon ( gamon @ garnet . berkeley . edu ) writes : enantiodriomia refers diachronic process acquiring " opposite " meaning , suppose word having two meanings enantiodrome . learned , , professor matisoff here berkeley . enantiodromia modals / attitudinals first example word had drawn attention is * doubt * , historically has meaning doubt something true meant suspect true . parts northern england , ' m told , still has meaning . was brought attention professor bill stewart cuny . another example ' m familiar is english modal * must * , is reconstructed meaning " freedom space " ; gothic cognate meant " free permission ( something ) . " are two classes explanation offered literature particular example enantiodromia . first explanation : negation drops klaren ( 1913 ) antinucci parisi ( 1971 ) propose semantic shift took place negative context , follows : neg ( free x ) - - ) compelled ( neg ( x ) ) given equivalence lack freedom something compulsion something , innovative " compulsion " semantics was reanalyzed " freedom " semantics negative context concomitant scope change negative operator . reanalysis is made esepcially perspicuous given & p 's notation , decomposes older meaning modal ( freedom / persmission ) primes neg ( bind ( neg ) ) : one is free something , one is bound ; is negated , first two negs cancel leave narrow-scope neg , resultant meaning bind neg " compelled " narrow-scope neg , follows : cause ( x ) ( neg ( neg ( bind ( neg ( john goes ) ) ) ) ) [ = j . ] - - - ) cause ( x ) ( bind ( neg ( john goes ) ) ) [ = john must ] same sort explanation applied reverse german modal * duerfen * , underwent semantic shift original " necessity " " compulsion " semantics ( cf . mod . germ . * beduerfen * " need , require , " * duerftig * " needy , poor , lacking " ) modern " permission " meaning : bind ( neg ( x ) ) - - ) neg ( free ( x ) ) however , a&p notation fails link conservative innovative senses natural manner . second explanation : antithetical nature modality kind explanation has been proposed breal ( quoted bech 1951 , p . 19 ) , visser ( 1963-73 , p . 1797 ) traugott ( 1989 ) , basically proposes permission is used polite imposing obligation , implication subsequently being semanticized , originally indirect speech act giving direct , conventionalized coding . one might same sort shift occurring present-day english contexts suggest sort explanation indeed valid , " leave . " one , least , counts " opposite " is largely matter scale one implicitly chooses along arrange items issue , specific semantic prime upon one chooses focus . , one n't even conceptualizing innovative meaning antonymous most conservative meaning were n't being preserved intact . another example is * prove * , middle english meant something " test , " legal context , " put trial . " expression " exception proves rule " was coined , quite logically meant exception counterexample generalization claim makes question generalization exception speak puts rule trial . verb * prove * shifted meaning 180 degrees , expression , illogical though became , was preserved simply 's handy - - whenever someone presents counterevidence claim , write off " exception proves rule " !
