Subject: summary names days

dear linguists , december 15 issue linguist posted request examples deictic expressions names days either side " today " . here is summary obtained . response was overwhelming - total 70 linguist subscribers sent replies . many , many thanks contributed . quite number respondents supplied information two languages . was duplication languages , namely japanese , mandarin chinese , danish , french , german , russian hindi . examples 48 languages , are : anejom ( vanuatu ) , = fee = fee ( solomon is ) , azerbaijani turkish , basque , bauan ( standard fijian ) , brazilian portuguese , bulgarian , czech , danish , dutch , english , erromagan ( vanuatu ) , estonian , finnish , french , german , hausa , hawai ` ian , hindustani , ipili ( png ) , italian , japanese , kamhmu ? ( vietnam ) , ki - swahili , kope ( png ) , korean , lao / phasa iisaan , lenakel ( vanuatu ) , madarin chinese , malay , mauritian / seychelles creole , modern greek , modern hebrew , norwegian , polish , quechua , rumanian , russian , samoan , serbo - croatian , slovene , sulka ( png ) , swedish , taiwanese , thai , welsh . original interest collecting deictic expressions stems general interest symmetry language language systems . most languages exhibit symmetry number deictic expressions diurnal units either side " today " , however , exhibit asymmetry . c . s . levinson ( pragmatics , 1983 : 75 ) reports , " amerindian language chinantec has four named days either side today ; japanese has three days back today , two ahead ; hindi has same word yesterday tomorrow . " ( levinson gleaned information : fillmore , c . j . ( 1975 ) . santa cruz lectures deixis , 1971 . mimeo , indiana university linguistics club . ) personally been able hold fillmore reference - living academically isolated south seas does drawbacks ! copy publication , interested obtaining photocopies section ` deixis ' . course , reimburse cost postage photocopying . anyway , symmetrical deictic system diurnal units / spans seems logical , though ' m sure verbalise reasons . reported asymmetry japanese system seemed bit odd . especially asymmetry was lop-sided towards past ( below reasons ) . upon further examination , discovered japanese deictic system diurnal units does seem symmetrical ; has + 3 - 3 either side present diurnal span . expression ` siasatte / yanoasatte ' meaning + 3 days " today " is known quite number native speakers japanese . appear used infrequently ` yanoasatte yaneasatte ' are considered dialectal ( least relation tokyo dialect ) . indeed , lecturer japanese department ( herself native speaker japanese ) was aware expressions until looked dictionary . another interesting consideration is question number diurnal units before after today languages recognise . is maximum / minimum number units ? , is average number units ( most popular system ) ? answers questions ( based small sample ) below . one respondent asked following interesting question : " reach level , let 's , 5 ( days after present diurnal span ) , does non-specific reading ` point not-to - far-away future ' those languages ? " language small corpus has + 5 - 5 diurnal units system is erromangan ( vanuatu ) . ask source erromangan answer question . is inherent problem determining number expressions diurnal units . is determining whether expressions are lexemes phrases . many languages seem " lexicalised " ( want better term ) prepositional / nominal phrases . languages , example english expression ` day before yesterday ' , retained phrase structure . one respondent supplied lengthy discussion lexeme / phrase issue . cites case bulgarian ( hope won't mind including discussion here ) : [ begin quote ] bulgarian presents [ interesting ] situation regard phrase / lexeme issue does n't real nominal case paradigm : onzi den - 2 ( lit . " / yonder day " ) vchera - 1 dnes 0 present diurnal span utre + 1 vdrugi den + 2 ( lit . " day " ) same form ' pozavchera ' bulgarian ( stress penultimate syllable ; russian ' pozavchera ' has stress final syllable ) perhaps does n't strange one n't expect ' po ' require particular case ending . however , again looks preposition adverb , exist phrase . bulgarian " tomorrow " is ' utre ' . " day after tomorrow " is ' vdrugiden ' - - . e . , phrase ' v drugi den ' ( lit . " ( ) day " , written without spaces between individual words . considered word simply orthographic grounds , though ? is prepositional phrase adverb ? course boundary between prepositional phrases adverbs is fuzzy begin . bulgarian " day before yesterday " , contrast , is looks noun phrase : ' onja den ' - - " day " . preposition ' v ' ( " " ) here . considered np prepositional phrase ? ' onja den ' is used same ' vdrugiden ' - - ' vidjax onja den ' - - " saw [ ] day before yesterday " . seems 's written noun phrase here is really adverb , ' vdrugiden ' russian ' pozavchera ' ' poslezavtra ' , difference being three adverbs are formed prepositional phrases while ' onja den ' has preposition . sound strange call prepositional phrase , , unlike ' vdrugiden ' , contains preposition . call adverbial phrase . ( expressions slavic languages are commonly accusative , origin ' onja den ' , since modern bulgarian has lost nominal case paradigm most part makes harder determine status phrases one . ( cf . russian ' kazhduju nedelju ' ( " each - acc week - acc " ) , means " every week " adverbial sense . ) bulgarian does n't specific words " day before day before yesterday " - - , , ' v denja predi onja den ' ( " day before day before yesterday " ) , course speakers avoid ' predi dva dena ' ( " two days ago " , lit . " before two days " ) . same true ' vdrugiden ' - - ' v denja sled vdrugiden ' is conceivably possible ( " day after the-day - after-tomorrow " ) , speakers 's led dva dena ' ( " / after two days " ) . difficult here draw demarcation line here between grammatical categories words vs . phrases . [ end quote ] quite number languages ( especially slavonic germanic languages ) allow recursion prepositions / prefixes " add " already existing deictic expressions . extent recursion practiced is limited pragmatic constraints . here are nice examples : rumanian : ras-ras - ras-alaltaieri ( ? ) - 5 ras-ras - alaltaieri ( ? ) - 4 ras-alaltaieri - 3 alaltaieri - 2 ieri - 1 azi / astazi 0 present diurnal span miine + 1 poimiine + 2 ras-poimiine + 3 ras-ras - poimiine ( ? ) + 4 ras-ras - ras-poimiine ( ? ) + 5 etc . dutch : ( eer-eergisteren ) + 3 eergisteren + 2 gisteren - 1 vandaag 0 present diurnal span morgen + 1 overmorgen + 2 ( over-overmorgen ) + 3 danish : ( for-forgars - 3 ) forgars - 2 gar - 1 dag 0 present diurnal span morgen + 1 overmorgen + 2 ( over-overmorgen + 3 - 3 + 3 forms are rather colloquial , nevertheless perfectly idiomatic . further recursions prefixes / prepositions are used jocular ways , predominantly children . finally , read far , are rewarded summary data point . number diurnal units either side " today " : symmetrical deictic systems - 1 0 + 1 examples - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 23 examples - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 14 examples - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 3 examples - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 1 example - erromangan ( vanuatu ) asymmetrical deictic systems - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 3 examples - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 1 example - malay - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 1 example - hausa - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 1 example - colloquial spanish ( southern spain ) 's interesting note language sample employs - 1 0 + 1 system . majority asymmetrical systems are lop-sided towards + side present diurnal span . why , n't . however , sample is small perhaps larger sample show lop-sidedness towards + " today " side . are languages show lop-sidedness state change ? most languages symmetrical vowel system e . g . same number front vowels back vowels . however , are quite number languages asymmetrical vowel systems . lies behind asymmetry ? answer question lie following scenario [ : crowley , t .
