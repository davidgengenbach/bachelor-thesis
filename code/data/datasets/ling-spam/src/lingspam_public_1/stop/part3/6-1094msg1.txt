Subject: phonemicity writing

estimate percentage world 's written languages are represented orthographically phonemic manner . specifically , many written languages are one predict phonological properties word - - - including stress , accent tone - - - merely consulting string symbols used write word , without further information , morphological structure word ? language whose writing system is largely phonemic , one write down set rules word pronunciation , ideal case number rules within order magnitude number graphemes . ( few lexical exceptions n't matter , long are n't hundreds . ) am leaving sense ` phoneme ' intentionally vague : normally phonemic written representation implies one predict surface phonemic representation written form word , perfectly happy considering system phonemic abstract level phonological representation were represented , surface phonemic representation predicted regular phonological rules / principles . ( note , clarify question further , am interested primarily correspondence between written form spoken form standard variet ( y , ies ) language , written form presumably reflects degree : am interested ( moment ) dialects language deviate varying degrees standard . ) , under definition , spanish presumably count phonemic since one nearly always predict pronunciation word , including stress , orthography . romanian is less phonemic since while actual set phonemes word is mostly determinable set graphemes used ( representation glides being slight source complication ) , placement stress requires knowledge morphological class word ( following work ioana chitoran ) . english is presumably among least phonemic , since ` regular rules ' pronunciation are themselves quite complex , are many lexical exceptions . particular classification writing system logographic , moraic segmental is unimportant : principle chinese writing classed phonemic ( albeit rather large set graphemes ) , fact especially among common characters are quite few pronunciation ambiguities resolved using lexical information . am familiar several recent books writing systems : while typically contain in-depth analyses particular systems , far tell , nobody has done survey kind . ( contrary , someone point survey answers question , most grateful . ) , interested getting much information related question many languages are sufficiently familiar . already answer questions familiar western european languages ( including less familiar ones irish welsh ) , romanian , russian , hebrew , arabic , chinese , japanese malagasy . particularly interested knowing languages writing systems recently been developed , spelling system has recently undergone massive restructuring : conventional wisdom has cases writing system phonemic , perhaps is always true . please send replies , are sufficient number post results survey list . - richard sproat linguistics research department at&t bell laboratories | tel ( 908 ) 582-5296 600 mountain avenue , room 2d - 451 | fax ( 908 ) 582-7308 murray hill , nj 07974 , usa | rws @ research . att . com
