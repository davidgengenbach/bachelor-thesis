language & species discussion has recurred week , had already prepared following , general enough interest recurrent misunderstandings innateness human language publish list . since posting language & species discussion received interesting comments checked reference had mind ( since own copy ) . reference is volume called " speaking apes : critical anthology two - communication man " . eds . t . . sebeok & jean umiker - sebeok . ny : plenum press , 1980 . is chomsky 's article : " human language semiotic systems . " pp . 429-40 . chomsky 's article is pretty much remembered , great many observations nature human language , characteristic concept human language , contrast / s animal psychologists had taught apes ( perhaps even thought teaching ) , e . g . , potentially infinite embedding phrases within phrases . beyond , challenges notion human language is ( merely / primarily ) system ( social ) communication , serves notion inappropriateness comparing human language animal systems communication drawing conclusions evolution human language ( imply is strictly human device interpreting external stimuli " thinking " ) . incidentally , rereading article changed earlier impression chomsky lacked " grace " explicitly acknowledging accomplishments discoveries animal psychologists , perception explicitness irrelevant distracting points wanted . course n't help activating involuntary visceral hostility researchers accused lack logic arguments , is another matter . most interesting was final position regardless apes prove capable learning , saw evidence qualitative distinction between human ape natural intellectual endowment fact humans acquire most ( syntactic ) properties language without ( even possibility ) explicit teaching , while apes obviously , despite " evolutionary advantages " ( c 's phrase ) bestow . particularly liked sentence following passage : " is difficult imagine children learning english receive specific instruction matters , even are provided relevant experience . fact , while children many errors language learning , never mistakes : never assume , until corrected , " candidates wanted vote each " means each candidate wanted vote . fact , relevant experience is never presented most speakers english , * pedagogic grammar ever point facts . * " p . 432 tell truth , n't error example ( maybe ' ve never been corrected ? ) , point .

) . however , ' m sure humans are constitutionally incapable seeing human language faculty injurious aberration - - can't . worst possible means salvation jeopardy our sinister instincts placed us . forgive even inventing consider idle repulsive speculation - - throws relief might inferred assessing chomsky 's ultimate argument understand . simple summation chomsky 's argument is : apes are capable learning " human " language , why n't ( naturally - - ) ? probably interesting arguable list discussion is chomsky 's point distinguishing " human language " " language " . chomsky sees human language subject scientific inquiry properties are quite specific , including syntactic properties reference , embedding , etc . are familiar current linguists . contrast , understanding article is sees " language " non-scientific concept , something vague even promising potential scientific field inquiry . vein , concedes apes many animals - - fact , does doubt - - symbolic systems ( semiotic systems ) apparently comparable principle lexical component language , though less extensive , , understand , less discrete ( linguistic sense " discrete " ) . supposes symbolic systems animals related shared intellectual capacities humans animals , humans interact distinctive linguistic capacities ( among latter suppose lexicon fills abstract linguistic categories grammatical derivations ) . illustrative passage ( p . 437 ) objects gardners ' characterisation teaching apes ameslan lexical signs teaching ameslan ( human ) language . , considers acquisition sign " " trivial , respect comparison human language . n't suppose is meant detract recognition apes ' ability grasp " logical operation " ( human definition ) - - recognition is irrelevant appreciation is distinctive human language ( , least " logical " concept " " is distinctive humans - - concept " plural " , , probably is n't either - - problematic is concept " dual " far - - apes been taught count ? hey ! looked had three identical rubber ducks , two ! ) . sum , , chomsky has specific single-minded notion human language allows immediately " through " claims animal manifestations " language " , had earlier allowed criticise ( condemn ) skinner 's notions " nature " human language . usual difficulty seeing point is much persistence linguistic debate whether extent " autonomous syntax " is valid notion ( let 's here ) , intuitive notion among linguists , everybody else , lexicon is major " part " " human language " . is certainly part chomsky associates distinctive innate human faculty language . rather , innate faculty is somewhere systems organise combinations signs , " somewhere " being crucial whether is evolutionary discontinuity between human language animal potentials " language " . course , another source resistance idea innate human language faculty is generalised sneaking suspicion anything proposes set humans apart animals fundamental is self-deluding anthropocentric self - aggrandising propaganda , cf . discredited ( ) argument against heliocentric theory solar system humans are " center " creation therefore location must pivot material universe . while sneaking suspicions are certainly appropriate issues bring something informal ling . list discussion , is clear fits formal scientific argument . misguided source resistance idea floated kant / innate discussion theory something is " innate " is killer further attempts " explanation " . killer explanation is " " " 's things are " . contrary , " " nothing explain were " 's things are " . confused , 's , scientists don ' t things are , our " explanations " are hypotheses test things are are . forgot context kant 's discussion " explanation " was , context " pure " reason " " .
