made following claim 22 - dec-94 posting : " x happens y is innate , is perfectly valid explanation x 's occurrence ; x happens reason , 's valid . " thought claim , being tautologous ( causes x , ' ve got explanation ) , required justification , apparently was wrong , since david powers ( 13 - jan-95 ) objects , basis ` " innateness " amounts saying " [ ' ] s fact life " . . . saying " are born " is explanation . ' is , apparently , even are born y , x happens , still n't explained x 's occurrence . huh ?
