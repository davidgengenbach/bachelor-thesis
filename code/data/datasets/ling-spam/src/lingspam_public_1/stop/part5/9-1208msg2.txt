conceive constraints being exhaustive ordered ? are universals constraint orderings obey ? are different domains ( . e . lexical postlexical level ) where constraints apply ? are language-specific constraints ? syntactic theory early 80 's assumed principles common languages interact various types ' macro-parameters ' : one deep property several properties derive ( e . g . pro-drop parameter ) . later , variation was attributed ' micro-parameters ' . , emergence minimalism optimality , basic issues constitutes universal principle / constraint , constitutes parameter , need re-addressed . is universal inventory functional heads / features ? autonomy , division labour between syntax morphology : is parametrized variation confined inflectional systems ? is syntactic variation restricted choice overt zero realization given feature ? movement takes place single cycle , does variation reduce presence affixes lack thereof ? are universal constraints morpho-syntax ? moreover , recent years has been argued thematic relations are features . are characteristics ? universal inventory ? parametrized ? many typological-descriptive generalizations await theoretical integration - e . g . greenbergian ' universals ' word order patterns , cross-categorial harmony effects , etc . respect , kayne 's proposal universal ordering merely shifts burden phrase structure movement . guiding heuristic generative grammar has been parsimonious ( redundancy-free ) theories are preferred ; minimalism goes further suggesting economy is built ug itself . extent hypothesis ug principles instantiate notions economy upheld ? studying ug , external systems interfaces invariant linguistically significant senses across individuals languages . thus posit universal interpretation mechanisms ( uniformity across languages lf ) , ' universal phonetics ' ( invariant articulatory / perceptual mechanisms ) , universal parser , etc . ; variation is confined grammars , particular phonology / morphology and&nbsp ; aspects lexicon . yet properties external systems far-reaching consequences our view ug . learn , universals attributed ug reassigned . ug - compatible grammars determine languages cannot exist are unuseable ( unparseable ; unlearnable ; etc ) ? are universal patterns acquisition process , parsing strategies , etc . , brought bear ? colloquium consist 20 talks 45 minutes each plus discussion . abstracts exceed 2 pages least 1 inch margin four sides employ font smaller 12 pt . sent anonymously tenfold , accompanied camera-ready original author 's name , address affiliation : glow selection committee c / o artemis alexiadou zentrum fr allgemeine sprachwissenschaft , typologie und universalienforschung jgerstr . 10 / 11 , 10117 berlin germany phone : + 49-30 - 20192404 / 1 fax : + 49-30 - 20192402 e-mail : glow99 @ zas . gwz-berlin . de url : http : / / www . zas . gwz-berlin . de / events / glow / index . htm workshops 1 . sources universals recent developments syntax phonology minimalist program optimality theory led insights structure human linguistic capacity . context theoretical developments , conviction has grown recourse innate properties language cannot explanation existence certain generalizations formal linguistic structure . idea workshop " sources universals " is bring together researchers various fields inside outside syntax phonology order identify possible sources formal universals natural language . possible sources following domains , semantic universals consideration processing difficulty considerations laws historical development languages considersations constraints language acquisition biological constraints sense " universal grammar " constraints inherent computational mechanisms serving language , list is meant exhaustive . contributions link formal universals discussed recent grammatical models sources are particularly welcomed . 2 . technical aspects movement filler - gap dependencies ( fgd ) belong most intriguing properties natural language grammatical theories deal . finding right approach continues matter little controversy . capturing core properties fgds , concepts strictest c-command , require fillers gaps immediately attached same projection line , arguably possess high amount naturalness simplicity . type constraint is directly reflected linear indexed grammars has been implemented minimalist extension condition structure building .
