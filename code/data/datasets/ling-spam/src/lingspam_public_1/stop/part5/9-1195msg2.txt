nips * 98 conference workshop ( part international conference neural information processing systems ) december 4 5 , 1998 breckenridge , colorado hybrid neural symbolic integration - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - stefan wermter , university sunderland , uk ron sun , university alabama , usa description motivation - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - past was controversial whether neural symbolic approaches alone sufficient provide general framework intelligent processing . recent years , field hybrid neural symbolic processing has seen remarkable development . motivation integration symbolic neural models cognition intelligent behavior comes many different sources . > perspective cognitive neuroscience , symbolic interpretation artificial neural network architecture is desirable , since brain has neuronal structure capability perform symbolic processing . leads question different processing mechanisms bridge large gap between , instance , acoustic visual input signals symbolic reasoning instance language processing , inferencing , etc . > perspective knowledge-based processing , hybrid neural / symbolic representations are advantageous , since different mutually complementary properties integrated . symbolic representations advantages respect easy interpretation , explicit control , fast initial coding , dynamic variable binding knowledge abstraction . hand , neural representations show advantages gradual analog plausibility , learning , robust fault-tolerant processing , generalization similar input . since advantages are mutually complementary , hybrid symbolic connectionist architecture useful different processing strategies supported . areas interest - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - integration symbolic neural techniques - integrating techniques language speech processing - integrating different modes reasoning inferencing - combining different techniques data mining - integration vision , language , multimedia - hybrid techniques knowledge based systems - combining fuzzy / neuro techniques - neural / symbolic techniques applications engineering - exploratory research - emergent symbolic behavior based neural networks - interpretation explanation neural networks - knowledge extraction neural networks - various forms interacting knowledge representations - dynamic systems recurrent networks - evolutionary techniques cognitive tasks ( language , reasoning , etc ) - autonomous learning systems cognitive agents utilize both neural symbolic learning techniques format - - - - - workshop provide forum presenting discussing theory practice neural / symbolic integration . format consist position statements / panel , group discussion individual paper presentations . intend reserve significant portion open discussion . proposed length workshop is two days . suggested panels are : 1 . connectionist models language , vision , inferencing . are principles neural / symbolic representation ? 2 . hybrid neural models media ( multimedia , web searching , digital libraries , etc ) impact hybrid techniques future ? submission - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - is intended publish results after workshop , either book ( springer ) via special issue journal . invite papers two forms : short position papers ( around 4 pages ) full papers ( 12 pages ) . intend process submissions electronically . please postscript file via ftp ( below ) . paper format compatible latex article format : 11pt , 12 pages maximum , including title , address email address , abstract , figures , references . notifications sent email first author . postscript files uploaded anonymous ftp . please send notification message stefan . wermter @ sunderland . ac . uk ftp isis . sunderland . ac . uk ( 157 . 228 . 12 . 13 ) login : anonymous password : < email address > cd pub / wermter binary put < yourfile . ps > < yourfile . ps . gz > quit paper must arrive later 25th september 1998 address below . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # submission deadline : 25th september 1998 update invited speakers , panel information please http : / / osiris . sunderland . ac . uk / ~ cs0stw / wermter / workshops / nips-workshop . html please send correspondence : nips workshop contact - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * professor stefan wermter research chair intelligent systems university sunderland school computing & information systems st peters sunderland sr6 0dd united kingdom phone : + 44 191 515 3279 fax : + 44 191 515 2781 email : stefan . wermter @ sunderland . ac . uk http : / / osiris . sunderland . ac . uk / ~ cs0stw / * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
