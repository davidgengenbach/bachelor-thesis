Subject: sum : nonreferential np 's english

week two ago , sent following query folks linguist : > interest is identifying nonreferential np 's written english > computer natural lg processing system set > referents serve antecedents subsequent anaphora > resolution . compounds ( e . g . duck-shooting season ) suppose > treated superficially single words , things ' lose > faith ' , ' catch sight ' . course , criteria involve > larger discourse issues , is possible identify > least nonreferential np 's " cheaply " , . e . looking > within clause / considering inherent lexical semantics . interest is examples ' john is teacher ' , where ' teacher ' is used introduce discourse referent , rather characterize one has already been introduced . thanks gregory ward , marion kee , louise mcnally replies comments . summarize investigations date comments : ward , gregory , richard sproat , gail mckoon . 1991 ` ` pragmatic analysis - called anaphoric islands , ' ' language 67 : 439-474 . - - contrary was assuming compounds , subparts serve antecedents pronominal anaphora . louise mcnally noted : ' first , appears languages article systems ( english germanic lgs . , romance lgs . ) mark " nonreferentiality " absence article ( . e . via bare singular , commonly , bare plural nps ) . although nps function syntactically nps articles ( contrast incorporated nominals ) , semantically pragmatically are quite distinct . . . english things are complicated fact bare plurals appear denote natural kinds , appears [ exception rather ] rule ( bare nominals languages ' ve looked interpretation ) . thus , is shared incorporated non-incorporated , nonreferential nps is thus ( 1 ) absence article ; ( 2 ) semantics / pragmatics . - - treat bare nominals property denoting ( alternatively , contributing descriptive content ) , whereas treat nps articles entity denoting ( alternatively , contributing both descriptive content , crucially , discourse referent ) . quantificational nps are another matter altogether . appear differences between discourse anaphoric properties nouns compounds ( " baby-sitter " ) bare plurals occur independent elements sentences . specifically , bare nominals are much likely felicitously license discourse anaphora " token " entities ( opposed kinds ) are nouns inside compounds . investigated detail , suspect differences involve sorts existential inferences via compounds vs . full sentences ( example , truthfully describe someone " tomato grower " _ t _ without being tomatoes person is growing _ t _ ; contrast , is true fred grew tomatoes _ t _ , must been tomatoes _ t _ grew . - - pair does n't justice complexity problem , hope gives idea differences one finds between conditions applicability nouns descriptions truth sentences . ) ' marion kee suggested marking phrasal verbs lexicon , example ' catch sight ' , where 's ight ' is non-referential . while is eminently practical solution thorny problem , mandate is explore methods automatically identifying non-referential uses , being ( presumably ) general , computationally less expensive searching lexicon given collocations . am still musing structural cues might used , perhaps combination semantic information . finally , attached brief summary ' backgrounded object construction ' roviana , w . oceanic lg , spoken solomon islands . am currently working sketch gr upcoming volume oceanic lgs . construction am referring called antipassive ( roviana has morpho-syntactic ergativity really unusual splits ) , ' cooked taro ' comes transitive , ' ' having ergative ' marking ' ( actually , zero ergative , is one unusual things ) , is transitive morphology verb . constituent order vao ' cooked taro ' / ' did taro-cooking ' comes intransitive , ' ' marked absolutive , constituent order voa . transitive morphology verb , o has ' moved verb phrase ' were inclined dynamic metaphors , case verb phrase was roviana . call ' backgrounded object construction ' . is used subordinate clauses , morpho-syntactic ergativity , does n't involve marking oblique , am prepared call antipassive . : backgrounded object construction ( ) ( optionally ) pragmatically backgrounding undergoer discourse ( coz is important ) ( ii ) ( obligatorily ) undergoer is non-specific . non-specific mean speaker does n't particular ref mind , even one might said exist , e . g . ' did taro-cooking ' implies taro exists , are focusing particular taro . exception : are asserting non-existence undergoer using prenominal modifier ' none / nothing ' , normal transitive construction . e . g . ' did n't kill anyone ' ( does exist person killed ) = transitive ' did n't kill anyone ' ( denying action , asserting non-existence referent ) = backgrounded object construction . thus : transitive construction is used undergoer is ( ) asserted exist ( b ) specific pragmatically backgrounded . backgrounded obj construction is used undergoer is ( b ) non-specific being asserted exist ( b ) specific pragmatically backgrounded . roviana has articles mark information statuses definite . np backgrounded obj construction however bare noun . thanks again those replied . further thoughts / comments much appreciated . simon corston
