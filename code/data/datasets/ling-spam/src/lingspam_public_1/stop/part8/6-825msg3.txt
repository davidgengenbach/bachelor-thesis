Subject: re : 6 . 797 , comparative method : n - ary comparison

gotcha ! are two separate fallacies argument against n-ary comparison discussed recently powers , delancey , guy are apparently seeking defend . ( 1 ) janhunen says probability match occurring purely chance compare japanese four languages is four times is compare one language . simply cannot true probabilities are values between 0 1 . probablity case binary comparison was . 5 , predicting 2 case n-ary comparison , is impossible , 2 is between 0 1 . ( 2 ) fallacy is purely mathematical , although suspect involves elements confusio . case , one argues n-ary comparison ever talks getting match 2 n languages . , guy 's numbers , scenario 100 - word list shifted meanings , came 14 . 5 probable spurious mathces binary comparison 5 . 8 are looking match between 3 5 languages , 0 . 13 one between 4 5 , does much smaller number yet case 5 5 . am sure jacques defines spurious verified numbers , are certainly right orders magnitude . consider languages ( initial probability match declines , usually happens toy models real data ) , happens is need fewer fewer n languages being compared agree . thus , guy 's example match between n - 2 languages 5 was less likely occur chance one between 2 2 . n were 100 , . e . , were comparing 100 languages , need n - 2 ( . e . , 98 ) languages agree able better binary comparison . many many fewer ( although n't many since formula jacques is using is assuming initial probability match ) . maybe , kindly supply numbers . light , let us add another argument rejecting indo - european : bopp never offered mathematical demonstration relationships proposed were unlikely due chance , much less doing binary comparison every pair indo - european languages . goes show unrealistic whole idea doing comparisons is . want , least let us clear minimize false positives ( . e . matches due chance really reflective common origin ) false negatives ( . e . , failures genuine historical connections ) . second point , are arguments n-ary is better . alexis mr
