h . m . hubey has made readers list aware interesting article appeared june 24 , 1995 , issue science news concerning evidence dna data indicating gene flow anatolia europe beginning around 9 , 000 years bp . hubey points is genetic evidence nomads central eurasian yamna culture spread westward europe approximately 5 , 500 years ago . while is indeed reasonable link first migration spread agriculture , does follow those migrated spoke form indo - european ( " pre - " , " proto - " , dialects thereof ) . nor does follow " [ ] t is possible both expansions were responsible spread different subfamilies indo - european languages . . .
