effect is referred ` ` long-distance scrambling ' ' . while scrambling has recently received considerable attention syntactic literature , status long-distance scrambling has rarely been addressed . reason is problematic status data : is long-distance scrambling highly dependent pragmatic context , is strongly subject degradation due processing constraints . case center-embedding , is immediately clear whether assume observed unacceptability highly complex sentences is due grammatical restrictions , whether assume competence grammar does place restrictions scrambling ( , therefore , sentences are fact grammatical ) , unacceptability ( most ) grammatically possible word orders is due processing limitations . paper , argue second view presenting processing model german . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * access reports : reports are available bound form price listed above , obtained free , electronically . obtain compressed postscript copy report , open anonymous ftp session ftp . cis . upenn . edu path : pub / ircs / technical-reports files are named according number . example , report 95-01 is stored 95-01 . ps . z , 95-02 is stored 95-02 . ps . z , etc . are using ftp , change setting binary download file . copy report 95-01 , type : binary 95-01 . ps . z obtain files through electronic mail . send mail message ircsserv @ ftp . cis . upenn . edu . message read " send technical-reports filename " . receive compressed postscript file reply . requests bound copies sent address listed below , include check price desired report . checks made payable " trustees university pennsylvania .
