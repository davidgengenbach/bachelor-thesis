hisatsugu kitahara , ( 1997 ) elementary operations optimal derivations , mit press , cambridge , mass . 140 pages , $ 15 . 00 . reviewed julie legate , < jlegate @ mit . edu > book is firmly situated within minimalist approach syntactic theory was begun chomsky ( 1991 ) perhaps most fully articulated chomsky ( 1995 ) . adopts much basic architecture 1995 version minimalism ( henceforth mp ) , while deriving several principles assumptions . first three chapters book propose comparatively minor alterations mp system , demonstrate alterations allow several stipulations mp dropped , while retaining improving framework 's empirical coverage . final chapter retains proposals previous chapters while putting forth condition is clear departure mp approach . condition , kitahara is able account several notoriously problematic wh-constructions . kitahara 's first chapter consists review minimalist syntactic framework . discusses conceptual foundation approach ( unflinching application occam 's razor every aspect computational system ) , guiding principles global economy , internal mechanisms computation ( including creation syntactic trees through successive operations merge morphological feature-driven move ) . second chapter contains core proposals book . kitahara replaces operations merge , move , erase two " elementary operations " : " concatenation " " replacement " . concatenation is procedure joins two objects alpha beta form object k . replacement , hand , substitutes object alpha object beta , where beta is contained within larger object sigma . mp operations are redefined using elementary operations follows ( p35 ) : ( ) cyclic merge = concatenation cyclic move = concatenation noncyclic merge = concatenation + replacement noncyclic move = concatenation + replacement erase = replacement further redefines shortest derivation condition ( chomsky 1991 , 1993 ; epstein 1992 ) terms operations , ( ii ) ( p26 ) : ( ii ) shortest derivation condition ( sdc ) minimize number elementary operations necessary convergence . given technology , proceeds derive several principles assumptions mp . first , considers cyclicity , providing detailed summary comparison approaches taken chomsky 1993 , 1994 , 1995 . derives , simple cases , cyclic convergent derivations preferred over noncyclic convergent ones , since cyclic operations yield shorter derivation . shown ( ) above , cyclic operations involve one elementary operation : concatenation , whereas noncyclic ones require two : concatenation replacement . next , turns mp principle procrastinate : covert movement ( . e . movement occurs computation after derivation is sent pf pronunciation ) is preferable overt movement . separates discussion head movement , object shift , expletive insertion . adopts mp assumptions ( ) movement results two instances identical elements , one merged position moved position ( . e . copy theory movement ) ; ( b ) element is overtly attracted , entire category moves , whereas element is covertly attracted , formal features move ; ( c ) one identical elements created movement is interpreted lf . finally , proposes novel interpretation effect strong features grammar , ( iii ) ( p37 ) : ( iii ) strong feature condition spell - applies sigma sigma contains category strong feature . regarding head movement , languages overt verb raising , t has strong v feature thus overt raising is necessary convergence . languages without overt verb raising , sdc selects derivations covert , rather overt , verb raising . although both covert overt head movement involve one operation replacement ( since head movement is necessarily non-cyclic ) , kitahara claims overt head movement , being category movement requires additional instance replacement , thus resulting longer derivation . reasoning is follows . verb moves overtly , semantic features are carried along . therefore , lf necessary delete one instances semantic features , since elements are interpreted once . requires application replacement is needed covert movement , since covert movement affects formal features , semantic features . notice same reasoning extend phrasal movement . overt movement require one instance replacement delete semantic features one member chain ( considering simple two-membered chain ) , however covert movement require one instance replacement , since covert movement is necessarily non-cyclic . thus , sdc cannot choose between derivations overt object shift those without . predicts optionality object shift languages icelandic , without resorting mp ' optional strong feature ' analysis , is simple restatement facts . languages without overt verb movement , object shift is predicted impossible , assuming object shifts outside specifier vp , inside specifier being merged position subject , multiple specifiers are equidistant higher head , unless head movement renders equidistant . thus , shifted object block movement subject tp , unless verb has raised t . kitahara acknowledges ( p144 , fn26 ) , however , cannot explain languages french , display overt verb raising prohibit object shift . finally , kitahara considers timing expletive insertion . notice although mp assumes merge is cheaper move , kitahara 's reanalysis predicts merge equally economical cyclic move , since both consist one application concatenation . since timing expletive insertion is primary empirical motivation mp assumption , kitahara demonstrates timing is equally captured within system . consider familiar sentences ( iv ) ( v ) . ( iv ) seems man room . ( v ) * seems man room . ( iv ) , expletive was inserted embedded [ spec , t ] raised matrix tp . ( v ) , hand , " man " was raised embedded tp expletive was inserted directly specifier matrix tp . mp claimed ( iv ) is preferred over ( v ) is cheaper merge expletive embedded tp move associate . kitahara claims facts follow sdc . since expletives are assumed semantic features , overt raising " " require application replacement delete instance semantic features ( iv ) . ( v ) , hand , overt raising " man " require replacement delete one resulting two instances semantic features " man " . therefore , derivation ( iv ) is shorter ( v ) thus preferred . side point , notice analysis requires formal features " man " raise covertly directly matrix t . features raised embedded tp covertly , non-cyclic movement result additional application replacement , ( iv ) ( v ) equally economical ( equivalent situation object shift ) . kitahara concludes chapter two note timing expletive insertion icelandic transitive expletive constructions . assumes mp analysis associate ( . e . subject transitive ) moves inner specifier tp expletive merges outer specifier tp , verb appearing between two verb-second phenomenon . notes although situation is opposite english situation discussed above , . e . here category movement precedes expletive insertion , is predicted restriction against downwards movement . assuming associate must move adjoin expletive lf , associate must appear lower expletive , order movement raising rather lowering . chapter three , kitahara demonstrates chomsky 's ( 1995 ) minimal link condition explain phenomena had previously received disparate analyses literature . ( vi ) minimal link condition ( mlc ) h ( k ) attracts alpha is beta , beta closer h ( k ) alpha , h ( k ) attracts beta . kitahara begins relativized minimality ( chomsky 1993 ) violations , ( vii ) , superiority condition violations , ( viii ) . ( vii ) * john seems is t ( john ) certain here . ( viii ) * did persuade whom buy t ( ) ? mlc accounts naturally facts : ( vii ) , " " is closer " john " matrix t , thus blocks attraction " john " ; ( viii ) , " whom " is closer matrix cp " " thus blocks attraction " " . next , kitahara considers proper binding condition violations , shown ( x ) . ( ix ) proper binding condition traces must bound . ( x ) * picture t ( ) wonder john likes t ( picture t ( ) ) ? argues proper binding condition analysis ( x ) is longer available minimalist approaches . condition longer apply s - structure , since s - structure has been eliminated model , lf reconstruction " picture t ( ) " create configuration trace " " is bound . instead , kitahara offers mlc solution . observes ( x ) involves two violations minimal link condition . first , " " is closer embedded cp " " thus blocks attraction " " ( note " picture " necessarily carried along " " embedded cp independent convergence condition ) . second , given illegitimate attraction " " embedded cp , " " becomes closer matrix cp " " , thus blocks attraction " " . assuming ( xi ) derivation employing greater number illegitimate steps induces greater degree deviance ( p72 ) derivation ( xii ) below is preferred over ( x ) ( x ) involves two violations mlc whereas ( xii ) involves one . ( xii ) ? ? wonder picture t ( ) john likes t ( picture ) ? kitahara extends analysis crossing versus nesting dependency data . ( xiii ) nested dependency condition ( pesetsky 1987 ) two " wh " - trace dependencies overlap , one must contain . paradigm cases are those ( xiv ) ( xv ) : ( xiv ) ? ? did wonder whom john persuaded t ( whom ) buy t ( ) ? ( xv ) ? * whom did wonder john persuaded t ( whom ) buy t ( ) ? ( xiv ) , kitahara observes , mlc is disobeyed once , raising " " over " whom " matrix cp . ( xv ) , hand , mlc is disobeyed twice , once raising " " over " whom " embedded cp , second raising " whom " over " " matrix cp . thus , following ( ix ) , grammar prefers ( xiv ) over ( xv ) . finally , kitahara considers scrambling topicalization german japanese , demonstrating certain restrictions phenomena receive mlc treatment . assumes both phenomena are feature driven , scrambling / topicalization feature attracted element is interpretable , thus remains accessible computation after checking . basic pattern considered is is possible scramble element constituent scramble remnant , however is possible topicalize remnant . german examples are provided ( xvi ) ( xvii ) : ( xvi ) scrambling + scrambling remnant * dass [ t ( das buch ) zu lesen ] keiner [ das buch ] t ( t ( das buch ) zu lesen ) ( book ) read one book ( book read ) versucht hat tried has " one has tried read book " ( xvii ) scrambling + topicalization remnant [ t ( das buch ) zu lesen ] hat keiner [ das buch ] t ( t ( das buch ) zu lesen ) ( book ) read has one book ( book read ) versucht tried " one has tried read book " under assumptions , ( xvi ) violates mlc twice , first scrambling dp " book " over closer vp " book read " , second scrambling vp " t ( book ) read " over now-closer dp " book " . ( xvii ) , hand , does violate mlc . assuming features drive topicalization scrambling are distinct , " book " closest available element scrambling feature attracting head , since " book read " topicalization feature rather scrambling feature . similarly , vp " t ( book ) read " is closest available element attracted topicalization , since " book " has scrambling feature topicalization feature . chapter four , kitahara discusses differences deviance between derivations involve one violation mlc wh-element . provides generalization ( xviii ) , examples ( xix ) - ( xxii ) ( p83 - 85 ) : ( xviii ) mlc violation involving adjuncts , subjects , quasi objects [ . e . " many " phrases ] is far severe mlc violation involving objects . ( xix ) adjunct * wonder [ whether john fixed car t ( ) ? ( xx ) subject * wonder [ whether t ( ) was fixed t ( ) ] ? ( xxii ) quasi - object * many pounds wonder [ whether john weighed t ( many ) ] ? ( xxii ) object ? ? wonder [ whether john fixed t ( ) ] ? order explain phenomenon , kitahara proposes following condition ( p90 ) : ( xxiii ) chain formation condition application move forms 1 > 1 chain ( s ) is legitimate ( = violation-free ) assumes traces attracted ( least covertly ) . claims illegitimate wh-movements ( xix ) - ( xxii ) form chain . therefore , wh-elements able interpreted lf , causing derivation crash . accounts ungrammaticality ( xix ) - ( xxii ) . ( xxii ) , however , kitahara claims formal features trace " " raise covertly check accusative case , is movement saves derivation . ( notice covert movement traces wh-elements ( xxiv ) - ( xxvi ) occur . adjuncts quasi objects check case , subjects move overtly check case . ) according chain formation condition , movement formal features object , being legitimate , form one chains ; particular , forms chain between raised position " " matrix cp merged position " " . thus , derivation interpreted lf , has status mlc violation . kitahara extends analysis ( xxiv ) . ( xxiv ) " where " / " " adjuncts ? ? where / wonder [ whether john fixed car t ( where / ) ? assumes adjuncts are complement null preposition . therefore , formal features trace " where " / " " must raise covertly check case null preposition , again creating necessary chain between moved position " where " / " " matrix cp merged position . chapter concludes book . although book stands solidly foundations previous minimalist syntactic research , remains accessible those are well-versed minimalist theory . provides clear explanations details previous minimalist approaches , kitahara 's own proposals . furthermore , relevant derivations are presented step-by - step , pace designed accommodate non-specialist . thus , presents opportunity those interested learn research issues minimalist syntax . those are familiar minimalist research interesting reworking application 1995 - style minimalism . anyone convinced recent discussions computational complexity local economy ( collins 1997 , johnson & lappin 1997 , yang 1997 , among others ) , however , dissatisfied approach , continues rely global economy conditions . since , course , everyone has been convinced discussion , is note prospective readers criticism . similar note , crucial assumption analyses is grammar count , is controversial , obviously false . note , regarding cyclicity , notoriously problematic case head - movement , chomsky ( 1995 ) managed incorporate " cyclicity " requirements ( forcing apply before introduction another head derivation ) , again falls outside analysis " cyclicity " . since head - movement require operation replacement , is longer clear force apply before another head is introduced . perhaps serious is reformulation strong feature condition . various strong feature conditions previous minimalist approaches are simplified first chapter ( ii ) above , repeated ( xxv ) below . ( xxv ) strong feature condition spell - applies sigma sigma contains category strong feature . difficulty formulation is renders strong feature condition s - structure condition thus anti - minimalist , since minimalism took great pains eliminate s - structure conditions . notice trivial reformulate previous s - structure conditions manner parallel ( xxv ) - - " spell - applies sigma sigma contains traces are bound " - - thus reducing minimalist claim s - structure is redundant matter terminology . furthermore , chapter , further condition involving strong features had introduced order rule certain noncyclic derivations . additional condition , given ( xxvi ) , is essentially weakened version chomsky 's ( 1995 ) formulation strong feature condition . ( xxvi ) alpha beta cannot concatenated sublabel alpha sublabel beta are both strong ( p95 ) thus , proposed simplification strong feature condition actually results positing two conditions , one is s - structure condition . another seemingly anti - minimalist proposal is chain formation condition , given ( xxiii ) above repeated ( xxvii ) below . ( xxvii ) chain formation condition application move forms 1 > 1 chain ( s ) is legitimate ( = violation-free ) minimalist theory claims computation human language meets inclusiveness condition , . e . elements are added during course computation . instead , computation arranges rearranges items selected lexicon . therefore , under minimalist theory , notion " chain " independent entity does exist , added during course derivation , violating inclusiveness . instead , " chain " is simply convenient term used refer identical elements derivation . chain formation condition , however , crucially requires chains independent existence computation . comments aside , book does represent step forward minimalist research program . kitahara is able derive several assumptions / principles previously stipulated . account optionality icelandic object shift is satisfying " optional strong feature " approach , although , was noted , does raise cross - linguistic considerations ( e . g . french ) . systematic application minimal link condition data captured various conditions was sorely needed , confirm intuitions mlc equal , superior , empirical coverage . finally , analysis " wh " extraction asymmetries presented final chapter , is one few minimalist treatments phenomenon . , reader book considered , clearly explained , thought-provoking . biography julie anne legate is phd student department linguistics philosophy mit . research interests include syntactic theory irish syntax . bibliography chomsky , noam .
