Subject: review : cook : case grammar applied

walter . cook . s . j . ( 1998 ) " case grammar applied " publication summer institute linguistics university texas arlington , 1998 , 271 pages reviewed tania avgustinova , university saarland . synopsis book is intended companion volume " case grammar theory " ( 1989 ) same author , is devoted application model developed earlier publication english text analysis . particular means main stress present work is methodological issues , are presented extended textual analysis hamingway 's " old man sea " . actual goal discussed monograph is twofold : grammar - present method sentence semantics describes meaning underlying each simple sentence ; lexicon - present method further defining each sense each verb / predicate terms semantic classes ( case-frame - based typology ) . each clause underlying structure is reduced kernel sentence is defined simple complete active-voice affirmative statement . texts are reduced sequence kernel sentences model used is case grammar matrix model . presents clear predicate-argument structure , builds lexicon distinguishes various verb senses , describes arguments occurring text , through covert roles , describes implicit arguments . model is supplemented conceptual graphs , following sowa ( 1984 ) . each verb type has generalised conceptual graph indicate predicate-argument structure ; each example text contains canonical graph sentence using verb nouns concepts , case labels verb-to - noun relations . book is organised following . chapter 1 ( pp . 1-54 ) presents case grammar matrix model summary form introduces conceptual graph representation . next four chapters treat verbs / predicates four distinguished semantic domains . chapter 2 ( pp . 55-90 ) deals basic domain includes state , process , action verbs agent object cases . chapter 3 ( pp . 91-126 ) deals experiential domain , domain sensation , emotion , cognition , communication . involves state , process , action verbs include experiencer case descriptions . chapter 4 ( pp . 127-42 ) deals benefactive domain , domain possession transfer property , describes state , process , action verbs include benefactive case . chapter 5 ( pp . 143-82 ) deals locative domain , domain physical location movement , describes state , process , action verbs include locative case . chapter 6 ( pp . 182-220 ) deals elements involved logical representation sentences , including tense , aspect , modals , performatives , negatives , showing elements included logical structure , ending sample sentence parse using case grammar . chapter 7 ( pp . 221-46 ) summarises analysis 500 examples chapters 2 through 5 demonstrates verbal hierarchy expressed twelve cells case grammar matrix , organised verbal domain , verb type , argument structure . each verb types is described together conceptual graph , frequency occurrence , subtype , defining characteristics . appendix text contains alphabetical lexicon , listing verbs / predicates examples together case frames ( pp . 247-52 ) , case lexicon , verbs sorted case frame together references each verb pages where verb is exemplified ( pp . 253-60 ) . finally , is list references ( pp . 261 - 6 ) , index ( pp . 267-71 ) . critical evaluation case grammar ( cg ) works labelled predicate-argument structure , thus , core , belongs dependency grammar paradigm . cg develops semantic valence system describes logical form sentence terms central predicate ( usually typically lexical verb , predicate adjective , predicate noun , predicate adverb ) series case-labelled arguments ( nominal , adverbial ) required meaning predicate . , type case considered book is ' governed case ' , fact , nothing is said cg model treat ' concordial case ' - cf . , e . g . , blake ( 1994 ) detailed discussion notions . is case concord english , hence , challenges posited ' concordial case ' are trivially scope presented analysis ( is based exclusively english data ) . ambition proponents cg is develop semantic interpretation system is universal across languages , tied syntax particular sentence . basis presented extensive data analysis is claimed five case labels used work ( . e . agent , object , experiencer , benefactive , locative ) are necessary sufficient description verbs / predicates language ( case english ) . possibility creating different lists cases is left open , whereby full translatability is theoretically expected between consistent list cases one employed cg matrix model . both predicate arguments are viewed concepts ( . e . conceptual universe is made verbs describe states events , nouns describe things ) , while case role labels indicate relations ( arguments bear predicates ) . cg is written conceptual graph format placing concepts ( predicates , arguments ) boxes relations ( case roles ) circles . arrows notation point away predicate is source case relations . advantage approach is possibility defining default position lexical predicate case frame , . e . respect arguments governs . discussed book , fairly credible ontology predicators is achieved hierarchically sorting according domain basic , experiential , benefactive , locative , ( possibly ) , within each domain state , process , action . further sub-classification predicates is based number position arguments . resulting hierarchical taxonomy is similar thesaurus entities are organised semantic domains . organisation semantic domains is worked detail precision . question case inventory is central cg , theory working notion case . methodologically , clear distinction must made between essential cases , are required meaning predicate , modal case , are mainly adverbial adjuncts . essential cases used describing predicates . despite lack universal agreement number case role labels are defined , author gives clear step-by step method , accompanied various concrete tests , simplify practice case assignment . thus , labelling is deferred until three basic questions are answered : many arguments are required verb ? verb type - state , process , action - is structure ? semantic domain does verb belong ? , naming arguments simplified set principles , combination set tactics formation case frames . within case frames , cases are listed left-to - right according subject choice hierarchy ( agent - experiencer - benefactive - object - locative ) is merely generalisation covering unmarked choice . marked choices violate subject choice hierarchy are indicated lexicon changing order cases case frame . possible variations involve " equatives " ( copular constructions ) , regarded model double - object frames basic domain , rank shifts subject choice hierarchy . lexicon , predicators are classified according case frames . case frame is understood configuration one three cases are required meaning verb ( generally , predicate ) . let us remind , however , , lexical semantics research , cases are known where frame contain five slots . famous example is verb ' rent ' ( russian : arendovat ' - cf . apresjan ( 1974 ) p . 134 ) involving following arguments : ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) whom , ( 4 ) much , ( 5 ) long . special attention is devoted possibility lexicon organisation terms derivations intended both represent linguistic generalisations simplify lexicon ( sections 1 . 13 - 1 . 15 ) . however , method followed work is listing each item separately supplementing lexicon redundancy rules relate lexical entries each . , each sense each predicate is treated separate item own case frame . order set guidelines applied cg textual analysis , concise introduction principles lexical decomposition interpretation covert case roles is given . lexical decomposition is understood process analysing predicates consisting basic atomic predicates . sentences is unavoidable determining actual predicate-argument structure . covert case roles , are required meaning predicate , are sometimes ( case partially covert ( deletable ) case roles ) always ( case totally covert ( coreferential lexicalised ) case roles ) missing surface structure . since cg analysis advocated book maintains obligatory object hypothesis , covert roles assume greater importance . cases where object role sometimes deleted , coreferential another role , lexicalised predicate , deeper analysis is needed obligatory object . certainly , lexicalisation manifestation propositional , essential roles is primary interest context revealing central predicate sentence . assumption predicate , even covert ( hidden ) case role , has defined terms full complement case roles requires clear distinction between deletable , coreferential lexicalised roles . author offers respect theoretical background concrete tests , procedures instructions guide facilitate practical analysis . two methodological principles are postulated ensuring conceptual relations flow central verb , deletable roles are included case descriptions . major asset book is , doubt , extensive textual analysis performed precision , consistency conformity postulated principles theoretical assumptions . limits approach are realistically recognised author , are stated explicitly appropriate places throughout presentation . reader well-developed detailed ontology predicates , covers verbs predicative adjectives , predicative nouns predicative adverbs . most important linguistic phenomena are considered systematic easy-to - follow . makes book valuable guide practical sentence analysis , useful reference material research purposes computer applications . references apresjan , jurij d . 1974 : leksicheskaja semantika . sinonimicheskie sredstva jazyka . moskva : nauka blake , barry j . 1994 : case . cambridge textbooks linguistics . cook , walter . , s . j . 1989 : case grammar theory . washington , d . c . : georgetown university press . sowa , john f . 1984 : conceptual graphs : information processing mind machine . reading , mass . : addison -
