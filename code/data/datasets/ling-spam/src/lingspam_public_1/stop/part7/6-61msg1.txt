Subject: re : racist linguist plot ( linguist list : vol-5 - 1467 )

regarding steven schaufele 's recent posting " language amongst anthropoidea , , racist linguist plot " , wherein claims never noticed anti-animal " racism " training : remember knowing racism yet knowing institutionalized racism - - wherein institution is permeated racism are even aware is racist . let 's change word " racist " * species-ist * , since 1 ) racist does n't exactly fit cross-species issues except older meaning " human race " , 2 ) species-ist points clearly our anthropocentrism , 3 ) longer current concept race history over past 100 years particular meaning ( check oed ) has proven useful inclusion explanations . dr . schaufele says , ) certainly n't remember anything introductory survey ) courses ' ve taken myself . . . much hinting is ) priori assumption field linguistics language ) is exclusive prerogative homo sapiens . maybe hints were around , never noticed . let 's next consider whether linguistics guilty overt * covert * institutionalized species-ism , embedded pervasively invisible . moonhawk 's institutionalized species - ism hypothesis predicts unwitting species-ism reflected : * textbooks through positing processes syntax morphology ( claim animals n't ) " universals language " * metonymy ( part whole ) define * language * terms putative universals , syntax & morphology , processes claim humans , calling everything else without machinery * communication * ( * true linguists * n't study publish .
