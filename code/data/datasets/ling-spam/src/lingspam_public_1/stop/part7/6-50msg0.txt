Subject: affirmative 'd o '

am working construction cape town dialect involves unstressed 'd o ' affirmative contexts : e . g . ' did hall yesterday ' . contrastive pre-supposition is intended ; speakers appear simply highlighting 's alient ' activity ( are present tense parallels too ) . although is traditionally believed ' contact ' feature cape town english , sounds rather relic early modern standard english , reinforced natural ( second language ) acquisition . form does occur ( though possibly different pragmatics ) child language acquisition ( sporadic & unsystematic examples britain ) ; is soon weeded grammar . question : does anyone dialect ( l1 l2 form english ; child language , early interlanguage etc . ) has something similar ? ( am familiar early modern standard earlier forms 'd o ' ; affirmative 'd o ' ireland south - west england - pragmatics are different , incidentally : ' habitual ' is function associated cape town dialect . ) thanks : raj mesthrie dept linguistics university cape town raj @ beattie . uct . ac . za
