torrego , esther , ( 1998 ) , dependencies objects . linguistic inquiry monograph 34 . cambridge , massachusetts : mit press . 197 pages . reviewed alex alsina , universitat pompeu fabra ( barcelona ) . book is study overtly case-marked objects spanish pays attention similar phenomena languages , particularly romance languages . is well-known direct objects , accusative objects , spanish , expressed full nps , dps ( author 's term ) , alternate between two forms depending various semantic syntactic properties : dps withouth overt case morphology , overtly case-marked dps . overt case marker question is preposition " " , marks dative objects . study adopts minimalist program , outlined chomsky ( 1992 , 1994 , 1995 ) , framework developing analysis various phenomena under investigation . synopsis chapter 1 outlines theoretical framework book sketches content subsequent chapters . chapter 2 presents various generalizations characterize spanish accusative objects marked dative preposition . among generalizations are correlations between overt case-marking specificity , between overt case-marking telicity , between overt case-marking interpretation subject agent cause , etc . common element explanation generalizations is idea marked accusative object raises overtly position outside vp , specifier position functional category v , takes vp complement . example , two following facts are observed : marked accusative requires ( require ) telic interpretation event is absent unmarked accusative objects , affected interpretation ( animate ) object requires overt case-marking object . is suggested objects moved outside vp delimiting role predicates , same , position objects moved , spec vp , is locus affectedness . thus , two different properties overt case-marking made follow idea overtly case-marked objects spanish undergo overt movement spec vp . likewise , observation overt case-marking object requires subject interpreted agent cause is linked idea overtly case-marked object is spec-v p hypothesis causative agent role is assigned v - vp configuration . torrego proposes are two types marked accusatives , one structural case inherent case . marked accusative is inherent causative agentive verbs those affected objects , is structural verbs . theoretical difference is appealed order account asymmetry respect extraction marked accusative objects : extractions are ill-formed former class verbs , latter . presence extra structure created inherent case marker is crucial element explanation contrast . chapter 3 examines variation causative structures spanish argues variation is largely conditioned case assignment . much discussion is based causative structure causee appears between causative verb " hacer " ' ' infinitive . one goals chapter is explain restrictions " faire-par " causative several spanish dialects . dialects , " faire-par " causative is fully acceptable following situations : ( 1 ) object clitic is present , ( 2 ) reflexive clitic is present , , otherwise are best verbs identified " constructive accomplishments " ' build ' case-marked objects . chapter 4 analyzes constructions dative objects , both ditransitive verbs unaccusatives . restrictions regarding constructions two objects identical case-marking are examined . chapter deals contrasts between presence absence doubling clitics . comparison is made double object constructions english . analysis is presented contrast raising constructions 's eem ' between those without dative argument ( acceptable ) those ( unacceptable ) . conclusions are briefly summarized end . critical discussion book is mine linguistic puzzles concerning objects , causative constructions , clitics , related phenomena spanish . is interest anyone concerned matters , regardless analysis theoretical framework one wish adopt . book is interest linguists want minimalist program applied particular empirical domain . author has done great job synthesizing data presenting generalizations need explained . despite positive aspects book , experienced serious frustrations while reading having data analysis . data problem data , is minor one compared one , has fact many data presented are alien varieties spanish speak am familiar . naturally , cannot claim varieties spanish , surprised discover data belong spanish . examples follow . torrego presents contrast pp . 58-59 between " quienes ( les ) vieron ? " " quienes ( * los ) vieron ? " , both forms are equally ill-formed clitic ( form parentheses ) is included . example " la guerra los hizo subir " page 101 is claimed allow animate reading clitic " los " , although allows inanimate reading , fact is claimed hold spanish dialects where pre-infinitival causee " hacer " intransitive verb is attested , causative structure highly marginal ( examples " la maestra hizo los alumnos subir " ) . construction exemplified sentences " hizo pedir yo , " is analyzed book , is alien . main problem numerous discrepancies data is makes hard evaluate difference interpretation data is due difference data ( obvious ) possible misanalysis actually is same data . illustrate , consider argument given support claim structure embedded under " hacer " sentence " la guerra hizo subir los precios " is single unit ( p . 102 ) . torrego claims standard constituency tests indicate sequence " subir los precios " sentence is constituent provides examples following support claim : ( 38 ) . lo que la guerra hizo es subir los precios . war caused is rise prices d . que ha hecho la guerra sino subir los precios ? has war caused except rising prices ? translation sentences is indicated glosses , rather " war did is raise prices . " " has war done raise prices ? " ( 38a ) ( 38d ) respectively . tend believe torrego is playing polysemy " hacer " " subir " . " hacer " either causative verb meaning ' cause ' ' ' generic transitive verb translatable 'd o ' , " subir " either intransitive , equivalent ' rise ' , transitive , equivalent ' raise ' . examples ( 38 ) relevant torrego 's claim , " hacer " must causative " subir " intransitive . makes exemples acceptable ( even though perfect ) is " subir " taken transtive verb , whose unexpressed subject is coreferential " la guerra " . , under interpretation , " hacer " functioning causative verb , counterpart 'd o ' . shows conclusively , variety spanish , interpretation is right is , , instead " subir " , verb has intransitive , unacceptable result . " caer " ' fall ' is verb : even though sequence " caer los precios " appear following causative verb " hacer " , " la guerra hizo caer los precios , " cannot appear focused topicalized constituent verb , ( ) . ( ) . * lo que la guerra hizo es caer los precios . war did / caused is fall prices b . * que ha hecho la guerra sino caer los precios ? has war done / caused except falling prices ? > conclude torrego 's data ( 38 ) provide evidence claim sequence " subir los precios " causative construction is constituent , those examples include causative verb " hacer " . course , reach conclusion variety spanish am familiar , where ( ) is ungrammatical . , , examples ( ) grammatical variety spanish analyzed torrego , case conclusion apply examples ( 38 ) constitute relevant evidence claim under investigation . analysis second difficulty book is analysis ( analyses ) provided . trouble understanding many analyses given : many cases , fail derive predictions follow analysis , cannot tell constitute counterexample analysis , cannot figure role given assumption plays analysis , etc . due deficiency part , readers might experience same difficulties . next , point problem cases . 1 . chapter 2 book starts list six generalizations marked accusative ( pp . 14-16 ) : ( 1 ) marked accusative cooccur doubling clitics dialects ( is necessary condition clitic doubling ) , ( 2 ) marked accusative objects are interpreted specific , ( 3 ) telicity requires marked accusative ( animate objects ) , ( 4 ) subject clause marked accusative object is agent cause , ( 5 ) marked accusative is restricted animates , ( 6 ) affected animate objects require marked accusative . indications given along are generalizations follow unified analysis . main idea underlying analysis is object marked accusative raises specifier position functional category v , takes vp complement . ideally , overt movement operation kind testable effects word order properties construction follow straightforwardly operation . however , torrego notes , is visible effect object raising word order , motivation analysis rests entirely explains generalizations listed above . generalizations are explained attributing various properties correlate overt case-marking spec v - vp position one-by - one basis . example , is proposed spec v - vp has specific interpretation , presence object spec v - vp shift aspect predicate telic situation , presence object spec v - vp gives agentive interpretation subject , etc . one wonders why analysis preferable one attributes properties directly overt case-marking : both cases , one-by - one stipulation those properties is required . is clear advantage is attributing properties special phrase structure position weak evidence is given . 2 . pp . 23 ff , torrego claims are two types marked accusative : marked accusative non-affected objects is structural case , whereas marked acusative affected objects is inherent case . however , claim is faced major problem torrego notes , simply disregards . inherent ( quirky ) case has generally accepted property is preserved under passivization : argument inherent case does n't lose change case marking clause is passivized . genitive dative case icelandic are example , dative case spanish is example case marking does change active passive . however , marked accusative case affected objects spanish is preserved ( relevant examples p . 28 ) . torrego notes , contrast spanish , hindi dialects preserve accusative " - ko " marking passives , citing mohanan 1990 . torrego goes ( p . 29 ) : " marked accusative " affected " objects were inherent , overt marking passivization preserved ( marking datives genitives is preserved icelandic passives ) . remains seen whether relevant data dialects hindi confirm expectation . " relevant data dialects hindi does confirm expectation , examples mohanan 1990 ( mohanan 1994 ) show . agree identify inherent case case marking is preserved under passivization , must conclude marked accusative case is inherent dialects hindi , case marking does change under passivization , is structural dialects hindi , where does change under passivization . are forced conclude is structural spanish is preserved under passivization . ignore evidence still conclude marked accusative case inherent case spanish is devoid distinction between structural case inherent case conceptual empirical substance is standardly asociated . torrego does explicitly reject association . 3 . agentivity effect clauses marked accusative is explained follows : following suggestion chomsky 's ( 1995 ) , causative agent role understood interpretation assigned v - vp configuration ; since marked accusative is assigned objects raise spec vp , presence marked accusative implies existence v - vp configuration . therefore , whenever is marked accusative , must agentive causative interpretation . happens verbs allow alternation between marked unmarked accusative object ? mean verbs alternate between v - vp configuration configuration , second option is spelled . , knowing consequences presence absence v - vp configuration has overt case marking corelation between overt case marking properties agentivity . 4 . pp . 34 ff . , torrego tries relate idea marked accusative affected objects is lexical quirky case grimshaw 's ( 1990 ) theory quirky case - marking . grimshaw 's theory , arguments argument structure are ranked prominence two tiers : aspectual tier thematic tier . adopting theory , torrego proposes ( p . 36 ) " argument ( subject object ) lexically quirky marked has thematic aspectual prominence relative argument . " is unclear one is interpret proposal . prominence is comparative property : is less prominent b . has prominence relative b is either meaningless true pair arguments argument structure : is necessarily true pair arguments b argument structure is prominence relation b . torrego goes state : " two arguments agentive telic transitive verb are both aspectually prominent . " true transitive verbs . torrego goes conclude : " approach covers fact object agentive caustive verbs must lexically quirky case - marked , covers fact overall phenomenon marked accusative case happens verbs agentive subjects . " fail predictions are derived . 5 . regarding animacy restriction overtly case - marked objects , torrego proposes term " actor " is appropriate characterize class nominals appear marked accusative term " animate " . motivation terminological change is found existence expressions denoting inanimate entities overt case - marking , following example ( p . 55 ) : ( 45 ) el acido afecta ( ) los metales . ' acid affects metals . ' ( suspect presence marked accusative example has verb semantics object . ) torrego does propose definition " actor " , refers reader jackendoff 's ( 1983 ) characterization " actor " character action-type event performs action . given characterization , is hard " los metales " ' metals ' example ( 45 ) interpreted argument performs action event ; " el acido " ' acid ' , ? torrego goes : " distinction between " animates " ( " actor " - nominals ) " inanimates " does appear semantic nature . " is odd claim , given notion " actor , " is proposed replace " animate , " is given semantic characterization . motivation claim , however , is found fact certain expressions , specifically proper names humans , used refer anything , boat magazine beer , always require overt case morphology , following example : ( 46 ) esconde * ( ) barbara . ' hide barbara . ' is suggested purely morphological property underlies overt case - marking , although indication is given morphological property might . possibly most robust generalization overt case - marking objects spanish is is restricted " animates " , even though are problem cases example ( 45 ) " personified " expressions ( 46 ) . problems , torrego gives explanation correlation between case - marking animate interpretation between absence case - marking inanimate interpretation pairs ( ii ) ( iii ) : ( ii ) . esconde este . ( ' hide one ( male animate entity ) . ' ) b . esconde este . ( ' hide one ( inanimate entity ) . ' ) ( iii ) . veremos otra . ( ' shall another one ( female animate entity ) . ' ) . veremos otra . ( ' shall another one ( inanimate entity ) . ' ) general remarks torrego often appeals intuition exposition analysis does work details analysis . following remark , reminiscent chomsky 's style , illustrates point ( p . 139 , end 3rd par . ) : " whatever details intuitive account are , general approach seems quite plausible . " one does work details account , is possible derive predictions , therefore theory is unfalsifiable . work torrego is part move towards deriving explanations general simple principles interact complex ways each . move is welcome one , careful does land us vagueness imprecision . is style explanation appeal is made principles , often unstated imprecisely stated principles , predictions are claimed follow , derivation predictions ( logical steps predictions follow ) is worked is possible prediction theory really is counterexample theory might . is danger reader torrego 's " dependencies objects " might impression explanations book are style . prevent impression , torrego made greater effort terms exposition ( even means leading reader hand ) show various predictions are derived . , is necessary state crucial principles explicitly , numbered items reader refer easily , assumptions representations explicit , step-by - step derivations various predictions . references chomsky , noam . 1992 . minimalist program linguistic theory . mit working papers linguistics , . 1 . chomsky , noam . 1994 . bare phrase structure . mit occasional papers linguistics , . 5 . chomsky , noam . 1995 . minimalist program . mit press . grimshaw , jane . 1990 . argument structure . mit press . jackendoff , ray . 1983 . semantics cognition . mit press . mohanan , tara . 1990 . arguments hindi . ph . d . dissertation , stanford university . mohanan , tara . 1994 . argument structure hindi . stanford : csli publications . reviewer : alex alsina , professor titular d ' universitat , faculty translation interpretation , universitat pompeu fabra , barcelona , spain . ph . d . , stanford university , 1993 . research interests include syntax , morphology , morphosyntax , argument structure , linguistic theory . reviewer 's address : alex alsina facultat de traduccio interpretacio universitat pompeu fabra la rambla , 30-32 08002 barcelona spain alex . alsina @ trad . upf . es
