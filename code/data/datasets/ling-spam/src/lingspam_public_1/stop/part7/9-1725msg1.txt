cheng , lisa lai - shen . ( 1997 ) . typology wh - questions . outstanding dissertations linguistics series . garland publishing , york & london . 210 pages . reviewed kerstin hoge , university oxford introduction book ( originally written author 's 1991 ph . d . dissertation ) attempts account full range cross-linguistic variation found single multiple wh-questions . aim , cheng proposes clausal typing hypothesis postulates parameter identification ( ' typing ' ) sentence wh-question is achieved either question particle overt wh-movement . first part book ( chapters 2 3 ) discusses clausal typing hypothesis predictions implications analysis wh-in - situ languages , single movement languages , optional movement languages multiple fronting languages . data multiple fronting languages lead cheng investigation interpretation inherent properties wh-words number languages . marks transition second part book ( chapters 4 5 ) shifts focus wh-words quantificational phenomena mandarin chinese . cheng 's book provides extensive overview differences exhibited across languages respect wh-question formation presents interesting attempt unify two previously separate approaches wh-movement arguing both properties c wh-words themselves are responsible observed typological distinctions . synopsis chapter 1 presents general aims outline book briefly introduces phrase structure mandarin chinese , features prominently book example wh-in - situ language . chapter 2 introduces clausal typing hypothesis . cheng observes languages allow wh-in - situ single questions invariably overt markings ( particles ) matrix yes-no questions . language has overt yes-no question particle , wh-question particle , need overt . question particles overt wh-movement , both identify clause interrogative , are thus mutually exclusive . account generalisation , cheng proposes clauses are typed s - structure either wh-particle overt wh-movement crucially both one language , cf . ( 1 ) . ( 1 ) clausal typing hypothesis every clause needs typed . case typing wh-question , either wh-particle c is used else fronting wh-word spec c is used , thereby typing clause through c spec - head agreement . ( = cheng 1997 : 22 , ( 9 ) ) two available strategies are illustrated mandarin chinese english , respectively . mandarin chinese satisfies clausal typing base-generating wh-particle c . consequently , wh-phrases stay in-situ . overt wh-movement is ruled principle economy derivation ( chomsky 1989 ) , according movement is costly merge , ' resort ' operation applicable clausal typing achieved otherwise . lf , wh-phrases move speccp scope , selection absorption purposes . english uses overt wh-movement satisfy clausal typing , . e . c acquires [ + wh ] - feature xp specifier . clausal typing hypothesis further requires cheng following assumptions respect english : ( ) subject wh-phrases must undergo overt movement ( contra vacuous movement hypothesis ) , ( ii ) q - morpheme [ + wh ] - feature is base-generated c , ( iii ) ' whether ' ' ' are question particles . chapter 3 discusses optional multiple wh-fronting languages present challenge clausal typing hypothesis . optional fronting languages appear both modes clausal typing , . e . allow wh-fronting although wh-particle ( given possibility wh-in - situ ) . using egyptian arabic , bahasa indonesia palauan languages investigation , cheng argues questions fronted wh-phrases optional fronting languages instantiate overt wh-movement display clear similarities cleft topicalisation structures . thus , ' fronted ' wh-argument is base-generated subject reduced cleft construction , while fronted wh-adjunct has undergone topicalisation . optional fronting languages are straightforward in-situ languages satisfy clausal typing base-generating wh-particle ( matrix ) c . multiple fronting languages appear violate principle economy derivation wh-phrases must move s - structure although clausal typing is satisfied single wh-movement . extending nishigauchi 's ( 1990 ) analysis japanese wh-words , cheng suggests bare wh-words multiple fronting languages are similar indefinites , . e . lack inherent quantificational force simply introduce variables semantic representation must bound elements sentence . is thus surprising interpretation wh-word multiple fronting language vary context . example , polish wh-words are interpreted interrogatives fronted , receive d ( iscourse ) - linked reading in-situ , are used polarity items yes-no questions conditional sentences , form morphological base indefinites , filling whole paradigms person , place . cheng argues four different readings arise are four different binders determine quantificational force bare wh-word ( wh ) contexts , schematised ( 2 ) . ( 2 ) binders ( readings ) polish wh - words : . wh is bound overt d ( eterminer ) ( existential reading ) b . wh is bound null d interrogative force ( interrogative reading ) c . wh is bound existential closure ( polarity reading ) d . wh is bound [ + wh ] c ( d - linked reading ) null determiners contribute interrogative quantificational force need licensed identified feature matching [ + wh ] c s - structure . is thus satisfy licensing requirement null determiner wh-phrases multiple fronting languages move position governed c . chapter contains discussion rudin 's ( 1988 ) proposal distinguish between multiple fronting languages allow multiply filled speccp ( e . g . bulgarian , romanian ) those where speccp host one wh-phrase wh-phrases are ip - adjoined ( e . g . polish , czech ) . here , cheng proposes replace rudin 's ecp - style account superiority effects analysis derives 's hortest movement ' condition , account observed [ subject + adjunct ] [ object + adjunct ] orderings wh-phrases bulgarian - type languages . moreover , suggests analysing ip - adjunction q ( uantifier ) r ( aising ) thus clausebound , thereby ruling multiple wh-extraction embedded clauses polish - type languages . chapter 4 cheng examines wh-words mandarin chinese analyses polarity items require both trigger binder interpretation , cf .

( = cheng 1997 : 161 , ( 31 ) ) ambiguity does , however , result different scope relations . rather , cheng argues , pair-list reading is due distributive reading mei - np is created association distributor dou . scope reconstruction ( frampton 1990 ) wh-phrase site intermediate ( vp - adjoined ) trace ( cheng adopts analysis english wh-quantifier interactions ) is possible ( 4 ) dou creates barrier intermediate trace therefore deletes lf . cheng 's analysis wh-quantifier interactions mandarin chinese rests assumption wh-phrases move lf . discusses both arguments favour lf - movement aoun li 's ( 1993 ) claim in-situ wh-phrases move lf since modified ' ' needs associated overt element c-command domain . cheng argues wh-phrases are modified ' ' must d - linked interpretation therefore constitute evidence against lf - movement . further notes reinhart 's ( 1990 ) observation d - linked wh-phrases move properly interpreted suggests movement takes place post - lf level . chapter concludes discussion landing site lf - movement cheng identifies speccp ( contra mahajan 1990 ) . comments cheng 's book occupies place marks onset minimalist approach syntactic theory . while assumes barriers framework chomsky ( 1986 ) uses disjunctive ecp derive locality conditions dou lack scope reconstruction wh-quantifier interactions , principle economy derivation is central argumentation . does prohibit language using both strategies clausal typing , accounts superiority effects bulgarian ( forcing movement closest wh-phrase occur first ) , precludes lf - lowering indefinite subjects mandarin chinese ( since is alternative derivation generates structure modal binder ) . moreover , rules multiple wh-movement clausal typing thus requires cheng account multiple fronting languages resulting licensing requirement wh-words . seen earlier , multiple fronting is shown correlate ability wh-words form morphological base indefinite nps . however , appears languages indefinites are derived wh-words display multiple fronting . german prefixes wh-word irgend - 's ome ' form indefinite , filling whole paradigms person , place , seen ( 5 ) .

' morphological forms possible readings german wh-words thus mirror situation found polish wh-words , described cheng . german polish common neither language has question particle ( under cheng 's analysis ) must therefore overt wh-movement clausal typing . however , whereas polish fulfils cheng 's prediction fronts wh-phrases multiple questions , german move one wh-word clause-initial position , cf ( 8 ) .

( 9 ) ver ' ' emetser 's omeone ' vu ' where ' ergets ( vu ) 's omewhere ' ven ' ' mol 's ometime ' vos ' ' epes 's omething ' things worse , multiple fronting is optional yiddish . wh - phrases stay in-situ without necessarily having d - linked reading , cf .

' german yiddish thus appear direct counterexamples cheng 's analysis multiple fronting languages . note context french , often cited example optional movement language , falls outside cheng 's analysis . acknowledged book ( 1997 : 39 , fn 4 ) , french does question particle is therefore in-situ language . nevertheless allows wh-words remain in-situ single matrix questions . might possible account optional wh-movement french postulating french possesses both non-overt yes-no particle non-overt wh-particle . french satisfy clausal typing base-generating wh-particle c wh-phrases stay in-situ . movement wh-phrase clause-initial position due another attractor , focus , is obligatorily present . whatever appeal analysis might hold , points problem allowing non-overt question particles . while expect overt wh-particles languages without yes-no particles , stop us assuming language allows wh-word stay in-situ has question particle even is ( phonologically ) overt evidence claim ? cheng 's proposal relate wh-in - situ availability non-overt wh-particles thus ultimately turn too permissive theory . another problem arises cheng 's approach superiority effects bulgarian - type languages . noted , cheng explains superiority effects violations principle economy derivation . given " adverbs are most embedded positions " ( 1997 : 81 ) , [ adjunct + argument ] orderings are ruled movement argument is shorter movement must therefore place before adjunct moves speccp . however , observed boskovic ( 1997 ) , bulgarian questions containing two fronted wh-phrases display superiority effects respect topmost wh-phrase , others are freely ordered , contrary prediction made cheng 's approach . comments aside , cheng 's book is commended . is extremely written clearly presented work fully comprehensible even readers are familiar literature mandarin chinese syntax heim 's ( 1982 ) theory indefinites . book is ambitious scope , discussing wide range languages , has undoubtedly made important contribution study wh-movement . references aoun , j . . li .
