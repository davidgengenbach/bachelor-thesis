Subject: re : 6 . 249 dick armey 's slip correction

someone provide context dick armey 's utterance " barney fag " ? heard once did n't write down . impression , however , was phonological environment did n't seem quite right spoonerism . one thought : seems binary opposition between intentional slur armey 's part purely phonological slip does n't represent possibilities . 's certainly possible string " barney fag " has been used often enough capitol hill hearing dick armey , might inadvertently substituted frank 's actual name . is n't something 's done : accidentally saying something one has heard recently repeatedly . " can't tune head ! " seems reasonable explanation " slip " was n't spoonerism . anything non-spoonerism phonological slips bears ? phil gaines
