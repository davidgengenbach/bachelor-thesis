' best guess based location ( algic homeland ) sort northwest coast origin , is real evidence . ' ' denny places pa speakers around upper columbia river oregon washington . bases conclusions archaelogical evidence , connections between pa larger algic language family , existence handful algonquian languages spoken along northern coast california . proposes pa speakers radiated south california west great lakes ( giving us precursors blackfoot , cheyenne , arapaho along ) . least , 's goes - really check article . ' ' blackfoot arapaho are most divergent ( algonquian ) languages , . . . thus family probably started northern rockies spread east . most algonquianists things days recognize lot problems siebert locating proto - algonquian southern ontario . ives ' article ( goddard 1994 ) makes lot sense - - essentially scenario is family came idaho thereabouts onto prairies montana , first dropped blackfoot . , continued east , dropping arapaho , cree , menominee - cheyenne , ' core central ' , eastern algonquian . ' m too familiar archaeological support is idea , is archaeological support siebert 's idea ( southern ontario looks historically iroquoian ) . ' ' having read number studies witold manczak seem show pretty convincingly conservative languages family are around original homeland , divergent ones periphery , siebert 's hypothesis much convincing , though are legitimate algonkianists side ruhlen . . . . ' ve been working algonkian over twenty years consider siebert one best algonkianists ' ve ever had . ' ' own part , seems probably relevant prehistory algonquian blackfoot , arapaho - atsina , mandan ( siouan ) hidatsa ( siouan ) are associated cultures practiced rather similar age grouping systems ( similar society names , system otherwise found north america ) , are located close together middle missouri archaeological area points north . region was fairly uniform culturally c . 2000 bp , wonder culture most widespead area - besant - source age grouping practice . might associated algonquian language ( s ) , though impossible prove . siouan groups must arrived somewhat later , during development subsequent middle missouri tradition , cheyenne seem middle missouri connection , perhaps algonquian affiliation middle missouri region is older . . . anyway , besant was largely algonquian , existing plains algonquian groups ( linguistic subgroup ) , reflect formerly stronger algonquian presence northern plains . ' ' position blackfoot , am myself opinion grammatical system is algonquian , lexicon is . cree ( central algonquian ) reasonably , blackfoot remains completely unintelligible , although language looks algonquian ( unlike , instance , gros ventre , arapaho cheyenne - algonquian languages are unintelligible , attributed recent ( few hundred years ago ) radical sound changes . . . . few studies deal place blackfoot comparative light . , simply is possible compare blackfoot algonquian lexically . actually are few blackfoot words ( stems ) algonquianists are able link algonquian . opinion . . . is mixed language , few algonquian stems , bulk unknown otherwise extinct language families . blackfoot stems sometimes algonquian backslang ( word 'd og ' ; blackfoot imita ( ua ) , plains cree atim ) . otherwise is impossible grammatical system is close cree whereas lexicon is different . probably few hardcore algonquianists agree .
