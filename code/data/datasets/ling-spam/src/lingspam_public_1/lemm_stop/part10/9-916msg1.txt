psycholinguistic , fpse , university geneva , switzerland ( nnguyen @ fapse . unige . ch ) . 1 synopsis 1 . 1 general outline book concern multiple source information process speech perception , generally , pattern recognition . base upon important research programme conduct massaro colleague over two decade . book focus perception so-cal bimodal speech , address wide range issue visual information ( provide speaker 's face ) auditory information combine each perceptual system . scope book much larger , however , massaro 's purpose here describe defend psychological law relevant wide variety domain . contrast already well-establish law same kind ( e . g . weber 's law perception ) , unidimensional , principle multidimensional , describe several factor impact behaviour . principle embody computational model pattern recognition , fuzzy logical model perception ( flmp ) , whose latest version present discuss detail . flmp systematically contrast alternative computational model , broad perceptual database benchmark throughout book . separate part , book deal method synthesize talk face experiment bimodal speech perception , introduce baldus , talk face develop massaro coworker . book accompany cd-rom contain series demonstration relate many topic deal . book divide four main section . section 1 , " perceive talk face " , focus perception speech ear eye . massaro review most significant empirical finding domain , discuss main methodological issue , present general classification exist computational model bimodal speech perception . central section idea speech perception obey general behavioural principle integration between different source information . section 2 , " broaden domain " , aim assess principle hold across broad individual situational variability . author demonstrate inter-individual variation bimodal speech perceive , depend listener 's age native language instance , account within flmp framework . using example different perceptual cognitive situation , massaro defend idea flmp adequately describe information process irrespective situational difference . section 3 , " broaden framework " , open presentation extend explicit version flmp , design particular account dynamics speech process . section include detail analysis methodological issue involve assess quantitative prediction psychology , along discussion critique express investigator flmp over . finally , section 4 , " creat talk face " , specifically dedicate synthesis visual speech . 1 . 2 behavioural principle although many reader already familiar massaro 's fuzzy logical model perception , shall here assume contrary , proceed present brief outline model . central assumption flmp pattern recognition involve common set process regardless specific nature pattern . speech associate dedicate process module , motor theory speech perception ( liberman , 1996 ) instance . contrary , sensory information assume process same whether our brain busy recognize speech sound , letter , manual gesture , few example . case , flmp postulate map stimulus unique perceptual category entail through three main stage process , feature evaluation stage , feature integration stage , decision stage . evaluation stage consist convert available source information set property refer feature . each feature continuous ( fuzzy truth ) value , represent degree stimulus correspond each set internal prototypical pattern , along particular perceptual dimension . thus , one important visual feature perception cv syllable degree open lip . model therefore assume internal prototype available perceptual system specify lip open onset syllable / da / , close / ba / , etc . second stage , feature integrate each , determine overall degree match sensory input each prototype ( e . g . each syllable receiver ) . third final stage , decision , basis relative goodness match input each prototype . flmp number specific assumption each stage process . first , hypothesize available source information simultaneously bring play pattern recognition . thus , visible speech auditory speech both assume influence bimodal speech perceive . second , different source information assume evaluate independently each . means example visible speech effect auditory speech convert set feature , two source information combine later stage process . model specific assumption source information integrate each ( multiplicative rule ) , decision ( relative goodness rule ) . major prediction model " influence one source information greatest source neutral ambiguous " ( 19 ) . prediction best illustrate experiment whose result serve database test model pattern recognition several occasion book ( chapter 2 11 ) . experiment , synthetic auditory stimulus rang continuum between / ba / / da / cross visual stimulus vary between / ba / / da / . bimodal stimulus present subject forced-choice identification task , along each unimodal stimulus . ( expand factorial design show massaro most appropriate experimental design determine two source information combine each pattern recognition . ) bimodal stimulus , main result typically depict two-factor plot , proportion / da / response ordinate , level auditory source information abscissa , different curve each level visual source information . represent , result clearly show statistical interaction between two source information . specifically , influence one source information prove larger middle , ambiguous range source . interaction graphically shape american football , reason present throughout book hallmark fuzzy logical model perception . summary , massaro propose universal principle perceptual cognitive performance explain pattern recognition . accord principle , " influence multiple source information diverse set situation . many case , source information ambiguous particular source alone usually specify appropriate interpretation . perceiver appear evaluate multiple source information parallel degree each support various interpretation , integrate together derive overall support each interpretation , assess support each alternative base alternative , select most appropriate response . " ( p . 291 ) . 2 critical evaluation 2 . 1 general evaluation book clearly major contribution study speech perception , generally , cognitive psychology . admirably clear write quite elegant manner . doubt book read great interest research scientist many different field . work result ambitious intellectual endeavour aim introduce behavioural law , place massaro equal foot weber 's law perception , power law learn . speech scientist present extensive series experiment perception bimodal speech . whatever stance domain , quite challenge massaro 's view speech perception constitute one aspect much general form cognitive process , namely pattern recognition . computer scientist work field speech technology particularly interest book 's final section synthesis visual speech . regardless background , reader book worth tutorial experimental method available investigate speech perception . great variety experimental paradigm task discuss length massaro , extensively discuss method assess computational model pattern recognition , particular , fit model observe result . respect , result experiment describe above reference database quite initiative view , allow reader easily understand massaro 's point issue raise , without again through detail experimental design each . book prove invaluable resource teach . cbe select prototypical result , set work historical context . number rather fascinate anecdote historical reference , mcgurk 's personal account discovery mcgurk effect , audio-visual rendition introduction george miller 's seminal article ubiquitousness number 7 plus minus 2 , miller 's face texture-map onto baldus 's wire-frame head . cd-rom accompany book enable reader directly experience psychological illusion associate perception bimodal speech , constitute most useful research teach tool . negative side , massaro 's / ba / - / da / experiment lead strand throughout obviously result book focus perception non-sense syllable . although interaction visible speech audible speech word recognition mention number occasion ( e . g . pp 21-23 pp . 181-182 ) , book contain few suggestion perceive isolate word , let alone connect speech . surprise fact little place devote present current theory model speech perception . although model trace mention several occasion book , fair flmp still lion 's share . book minor defect absence list figure , fact cd-rom band ( 1 . 4 , 1 . 5 1 . 6 ) refer incorrectly text . list cd-rom selection point page where each band refer . another domain , quite interest perceptual database book available cd-rom . although probably require substantial amount additional work , useful provide interactive version main computational model discuss book ( flmp , race model , single channel model , etc . ) . flmp model download massaro 's laboratory web site santa cruz ( http : / / mambo . ucsc . edu ) , currently distribute fortran code modify recompile each set datum , operation probably reach many student psychology linguistics . 2 . 2 specific comment familiar area deal book , hide fact review bias toward own interest , namely production perception auditory speech . follow comment specifically concentrate two issue relate area research , role feature speech process course speech process . 2 . 2 . 1 feature most useful extensive comment massaro status feature model ( particular chapter 2 chapter 10 ) . long difficult determine close feature classical phonetic feature . book clear direct relation between former latter . indicate above , flmp postulate three main stage process pattern recognition : feature evaluation stage , feature integration stage , decision stage . specific assumption model feature integrate each , decision depend outcome integration . set feature value , therefore , model predict probability occurrence each possible response ( e . g . " ba " " da " ) . however , attention pay fact feature value derive stimulus . actually determine posteriorus manner , subject ' observe response , algorithm ( stepit ) allow deviation between response predict one minimal . feature model * free parameter * , whose value set basis actual performance subject pattern recognition task , model perform best , . e . maximize goodness fit . accord massaro , " [ model ] * predict * exact * form * result , * postdict * actual quantitative * value * overall prediction " ( p . 294 , emphasis ) . word , stimulus occasion explicitly map onto internal feature flmp model . respect , feature define flmp markedly different phonetic feature . let us example opposition between / ba / / da / , much emphasis put book . acoustically , / b / / d / differ each accord feature grave-acute , / b / classify grave / d / acute . case flmp feature , grave acute view target value refer prototypical stop . however , grave-acute feature explicitly define acoustical term ( e . g . slope short-term spectrum release stop , steven & blumstein , 1978 ) . contrary , exact nature flmp feature remains undetermine , value subject one main constraint model account subject ' response accurately possible . thus , acoustic structure stimulus directly consideration estimation feature value . experiment audible speech , flmp feature lend themselve acoustic interpretation . / ba / - / da / experiment example , prototype / ba / / da / assume include one auditory feature , namely variation frequency second ( f2 ) third ( f3 ) formant onset vowel ( slightly fall f2-f3 / da / , rise f2-f3 / ba / ) . however , interpretation stem fact f2 f3 onset frequency precisely acoustic parameter manipulate experimenter synthesize auditory continuum between / ba / / da / . word , acoustic significance flmp feature derive experiment design . model rely particular system acoustic feature ( example steven & blumstein , 1978 , alternative system ) , system embody experimental design , external model itself . practice , therefore , issue speech sound map onto feature address model . why clear . several occasion , massaro suggest determine advance individual convert stimulus set feature value simply our reach . stimulus-to - feature map show variability analogous variability weather : too many previous contribution influence allow quantitative prediction ( 135 ) . fundamental distinction fact establish flmp between intake * information * , . e . stimulus-to - feature map , * information process * , . e . feature combine each map response ( cf . p . 135 ) . while flmp predict information process same one individual , regardless whether relate speech sound , facial movement , manual gesture , etc . , assume information extract stimulus contrary subject too many source variation accurately characterize ahead . understand , means so-cal evaluation stage cannot account model , least much accuracy . however , least one occasion massaro suggest limitation consubstantial every model perception pattern recognition , circumvent . accord , one indeed " easily hypothesize function relate feature value stimulus level , [ although ] represent * model information * addition one information process " ( 294 , emphasis ) . suggest build model information feasible . whether possibility flmp complete model kind , . e . explicit stimulus-to - feature map stage , issue remains address . 2 . 2 . 2 course speech process play quite central role different book . first , massaro show flmp explicitly formalize account dynamics perceptual process ( chap . 9 ) . formalization present reply criticism express number investigator ( e . g . mcclelland , 1991 ) , point flmp accurately characterize asymptotic outcome perceptual system ( e . g . probability particular response occur ) , little course process . dynamic version flmp intend address reaction . version , stimulus-to - feature map assume certain amount . dure interval , information stimulus gradually accumulate , become increasingly accurate . assume accuracy increase negatively accelerate function process , information glean early late process stimulus . one further assumption " integration separate feature [ ] update continuously featural information evaluate . similarly , decision [ ] occur after stimulus presentation " ( 259 ) . thus , partial temporal overlap between different stage process , sense one process begin before previous process finish ( figure 2 . 1 , p . 41 ) . assumption course information process support number experiment concern effect backward mask recognition pure tone , recognition letter . speech obviously raise number specific issue domain , however . unlike write word , speech temporal phenomenon , continuous ( . e . systematic acoustic boundary between phoneme , syllable , word ) , furthermore , per se serve source information speech , point massaro ( e . g . vowel duration major cue voice follow obstruent , one example ) . somewhat regrettably , few indication model assess speech domain ( remark p . 194 p . 263 ) . addition discuss dynamics process , massaro examine temporal relation between source information deal pattern recognition . chapter 3 focus our sensitivity temporal asynchrony between visible audible speech . experiment report chapter , bimodal cv syllable various degree onset asynchrony between auditory synthetic speech visible synthetic speech present subject forced-choice identification task . result show integration between two source information still occur source information asynchronous , provide shift exceed certain duration . one major challenge phonetician psycholinguist alike characterize relationship between call * external * dynamics speech , . e . temporal organization speech signal , * internal * course speech process . both play role perception speech , most difficult tell apart respective influence listener 's behaviour ( samuel , 1996 ) . example , gate study investigate role vowel duration cue voice post-vocalic stop cvc syllable , warren marslen - wilson ( 1988 ) proportion voiced-coda response increase listener present increasingly long portion initial cv sequence . one obvious interpretation longer vowel perceive associate voice coda rather voiceless one . keep massaro 's dynamical flmp , however , assume evaluate information provide vowel , evidence point voice coda gradually accumulate process available listener , thing equal . thus , above raise issue differentiate effect vowel duration per se listener 's response , internal dynamics process . although issue directly address book , doubt flmp constitute most appropriate framework further investigation domain . 2 . 3 general conclusion book provide us quite extensive review work carry author multiple cue speech perception , generally , pattern recognition . aim large audience , constitute most useful tool both teach research purpose . doubt soon become major reference researcher phonetics , psycholinguistic , cognitive psychology . 4 bibliography liberman , . m .
