Subject: phonemicity write

estimate percentage world 's write language represent orthographically phonemic manner . specifically , many write language one predict phonological property word - - - include stress , accent tone - - - merely consult string symbol write word , without further information , morphological structure word ? language whose write system largely phonemic , one write down set rule word pronunciation , ideal case number rule within order magnitude number grapheme . ( few lexical exception n't matter , long n't hundred . ) leave sense ` phoneme ' intentionally vague : normally phonemic write representation imply one predict surface phonemic representation write form word , perfectly happy consider system phonemic abstract level phonological representation represent , surface phonemic representation predict regular phonological rule / principle . ( note , clarify question further , interest primarily correspondence between write form speak form standard variet ( y , ie ) language , write form presumably reflect degree : interest ( moment ) dialect language deviate vary degree standard . ) , under definition , spanish presumably count phonemic since one nearly alway predict pronunciation word , include stress , orthography . romanian less phonemic since while actual set phoneme word mostly determinable set grapheme ( representation glide slight source complication ) , placement stress require knowledge morphological class word ( follow work ioana chitoran ) . english presumably among least phonemic , since ` regular rule ' pronunciation themselve quite complex , many lexical exception . particular classification write system logographic , moraic segmental unimportant : principle chinese write class phonemic ( albeit rather large set grapheme ) , fact especially among common character quite few pronunciation ambiguity resolve lexical information . familiar several recent book write system : while typically contain in-depth analysis particular system , far tell , nobody survey kind .
