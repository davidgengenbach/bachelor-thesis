call papers ijcai-95 workshop context natural language processing august 19 , 20 , 21 , 1995 montreal , canada correct interpretation natural language utterance text require linguistic non-linguistic context . goal workshop investigate nature context natural language , role natural language process , shed light largely unexplore area great theoretical practical importance . dialogue text process two application domain where lack theory context impede significant progress apply develop technology . speech technology mature , become technically feasible build dialogue system . however , understand dialogue , especially multimodal dialogue , possible without account role context . similarly , today 's text process technology feasible automatically create knowledge base fairly unconstrain text newspaper archive . ignore context text , however , result knowledge base incomplete , dramatically different knowledge base create human , base same text . invite papers researcher active field natural language process , knowledge representation , relate area address theoretical aspect context implication design practical nlp system . interest report implement nlp system utilize contextual information . interest knowledge representation system , inference method , algorithm allow one computationally handle specific aspect context . agenda : our workshop provide answer insight answer number question , include follow : : role context natural language context ? " context previous utterance / sentence " " context dialog-so - far / text-so - far " relationship between ? many different context ? two context different ? relationship between formalization context natural language idea context ? status context formal representation aim truthfully capture characteristic natural language ? is context inherent characteristic natural language ultimately decide formal power natural language ? is natural language minus context less powerful formal language ? doe represent context truthfully capture characteristic natural language require knowledge representation automate reason system ? relationship between context , semantics pragmatic natural language ? is context different possible world situation ? relationship between domain ontology context ? ii : context-dependent interpretation natural language context affect interpretation natural language utterance text ? aspect context context result refine , general , different interpretation natural language ? aspect context explicit implicit natural language utterance text ? phenomenon inference observe natural language context-independent one alway depend context ? iii : computability doe handle context increase decrease computational complexity natural language process ? automatically identify context-provide constraint result convey understand additional different aspect information ? represent those extra constraint provide context automatically compute context-dependent interpretation natural language ? final interpretation natural language decontextualize store knowledge base ? information obtain one context utilize another , possibly unanticipate context ? workshop format : hold four session : : role context natural language ii : context - dependent interpretation natural language iii : computability iv : general discussion session , ii , iii mildly structure : first , committee present brief overview possible answer specific question include agenda , discuss own answer . presentation mix question participant . second , participant whose papers accept briefly comment own answer question . presentation mix question participant . session iv , general discussion , each participant chance statement context-relate issue , comment , raise question , argue against answer etc . pre-worshop activities : pre-workshop mail list establish ; please , indicate whether want include ; order facilitate interaction focus discussion , two month before workshop , provide participant specific example datum illustrate various aspect context . author + title + abstract accept papers , papers themselve , available on-line everybody . papers available workshop participant . hope encourage strong claim even support quite , report partial , ongo , promise research , frank evaluate exist approach own accomplishment , openly comment limitation , short , those ( ) informative thing sometime difficult , impossible , communicate " official " publication . share datum , reference , papers mail list allow participant : - sort many possible thing before workshop - help focus workshop discussion hardest most controversial issue - raise objection bring controversial claim early order prepare answer constructive critique participants : limit number , 30 , active participant select basis submit papers . small number , 5 , no-paper - attendance-only participant consider ; person submit one page research summary list relevant publication . attendee require register main ijcai-95 conference . schedule / deadlines : soon mosaic home page workshop set 3 . 15 . 95 paper receive 4 . 3 . 95 select papers accept participant choose 4 . 5 . 95 acceptance notification send author sent ijcai select papers include work note list confirm participant request equipment / room 4 . 15 . 95 mosaic home page workshop update e-mail discussion begin 5 . 1 . 95 distribute participant final list specific issue discuss workshop reference exist work context example datum illustrate various aspect context 7 . 15 . 95 final list participant send ijcai 8 . 19 . 95 workshop place 12 . 1 . 95 written review workshop ready paper format : same ijcai-95 : 12 pt article latex style 15 page maximum , include title , abstract , figure , reference first page must include : title author 's name ( s ) affiliation complete mail address e-mail address phone / fax number ( s ) abstract 200 word keyword submissions : electronic submission strongly prefer : direct : anonymous ftp ftp . c . wayne . edu ~ pub / context directory place postscript ascii version paper , author + title + abstract ascii file , reference ( bibtex format prefer ) file , file sample datum / specific example please , name file name first author . example , john block place follow : block . p . p version paper block . text ascii version paper . p possible block-a . text ascii file author name , title , abstract block-r . bbl bibliography file reference block-e . text ascii file sample datum / specific example email : lucja @ c . wayne . edu resort , four hard copy paper snail mail lucja iwanska department computer science wayne state university detroit , mi 48202 , usa ( 313 ) 577-1667 ( phone ) ( 313 ) 577-2478 ( secretary ) ( 313 ) 577-6868 ( fax ) info workshop abstract accept papers available vium mosaic home page http : / / www . c . wayne . edu / context primary contact : question need additional information , please contact lucja iwanska department computer science wayne state university detroit , mi 48202 lucja @ c . wayne . edu ( 313 ) 577-1667 ( phone ) ( 313 ) 577-2478 ( secretary ) ( 313 ) 577-6868 ( fax ) program committee : harry c . bunt , kub - university ( netherland ) keith devlin , saint mary 's college ( usa ) r . v . guha , microelectronic computer technology corporation ( usa ) lucja iwanska , wayne state university ( usa ) karen jensen , microsoft corporation ( usa ) john mccarthy , stanford university ( usa ) john f . sowa , suny binghampton ( usa ) wlodek zadrozny , ibm tj watson research center ( usa )
