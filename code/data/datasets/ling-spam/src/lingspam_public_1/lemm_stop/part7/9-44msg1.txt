epstein 1992 ) term operation , ( ius ) ( p26 ) : ( ius ) shortest derivation condition ( sdc ) minimize number elementary operation necessary convergence . given technology , proceeds derive several principle assumption mp . first , consider cyclicity , provide detail summary comparison approach chomsky 1993 , 1994 , 1995 . derive , simple case , cyclic convergent derivation prefer over noncyclic convergent one , since cyclic operation yield shorter derivation . show ( ) above , cyclic operation involve one elementary operation : concatenation , wherea noncyclic one require two : concatenation replacement . next , turn mp principle procrastinate : covert movement ( . e . movement occur computation after derivation send pf pronunciation ) preferable overt movement . separate discussion head movement , object shift , expletive insertion . adopt mp assumption ( ) movement result two instance identical element , one merge position move position ( . e . copy theory movement ) ; ( b ) element overtly attract , entire category move , wherea element covertly attract , formal feature move ; ( c ) one identical element create movement interpret lf . finally , propose novel interpretation effect strong feature grammar , ( iius ) ( p37 ) : ( iius ) strong feature condition spell - apply sigma sigma contain category strong feature . regard head movement , language overt verb raise , t strong v feature thus overt raise necessary convergence . language without overt verb raise , sdc select derivation covert , rather overt , verb raise . although both covert overt head movement involve one operation replacement ( since head movement necessarily non-cyclic ) , kitahara claim overt head movement , category movement require additional instance replacement , thus result longer derivation . hbe reason follow . verb move overtly , semantic feature carry along . therefore , lf necessary delete one instance semantic feature , since element interpret once . require application replacement need covert movement , since covert movement affect formal feature , semantic feature . notice same reason extend phrasal movement . overt movement require one instance replacement delete semantic feature one member chain ( consider simple two-member chain ) , however covert movement require one instance replacement , since covert movement necessarily non-cyclic . thus , sdc cannot choose between derivation overt object shift those without . predict optionality object shift language icelandic , without resort mp ' optional strong feature ' analysis , simple restatement fact . language without overt verb movement , object shift predict impossible , assume object shift outside specifier vp , inside specifier merge position subject , multiple specifier equidistant higher head , unless head movement render equidistant . thus , shift object block movement subject tp , unless verb raise t . kitahara acknowledge ( p144 , fn26 ) , however , cannot explain language french , display overt verb raise prohibit object shift . finally , kitahara consider expletive insertion . notice although mp assume merge cheaper move , kitahara 's reanalysis predict merge equally economical cyclic move , since both consist one application concatenation . since expletive insertion primary empirical motivation mp assumption , kitahara demonstrate equally capture within system . consider familiar sentence ( iv ) ( v ) . ( iv ) seem man room . ( v ) * seem man room . ( iv ) , expletive insert embed [ spec , t ] raise matrix tp . ( v ) , hand , " man " raise embed tp expletive insert directly specifier matrix tp . mp claim ( iv ) prefer over ( v ) cheaper merge expletive embed tp move associate . kitahara claim fact follow sdc . since expletive assume semantic feature , overt raise " " require application replacement delete instance semantic feature ( iv ) . ( v ) , hand , overt raise " man " require replacement delete one result two instance semantic feature " man " . therefore , derivation ( iv ) shorter ( v ) thus prefer . side point , notice analysis require formal feature " man " raise covertly directly matrix t . feature raise embed tp covertly , non-cyclic movement result additional application replacement , ( iv ) ( v ) equally economical ( equivalent situation object shift ) . kitahara conclude chapter two note expletive insertion icelandic transitive expletive construction . assume mp analysis associate ( . e . subject transitive ) move inner specifier tp expletive merge outer specifier tp , verb appear between two verb-second phenomenon . note although situation opposite english situation discuss above , . e . here category movement precede expletive insertion , predict restriction against downward movement . assume associate must move adjoin expletive lf , associate must appear lower expletive , order movement raise rather lower . chapter three , kitahara demonstrate chomsky 's ( 1995 ) minimal link condition explain phenomenon previously receive disparate analysis literature . ( vus ) minimal link condition ( mlc ) h ( k ) attract alpha beta , beta closer h ( k ) alpha , h ( k ) attract beta . kitahara begin relativize minimality ( chomsky 1993 ) violation , ( vius ) , superiority condition violation , ( viius ) . ( vius ) * john seem t ( john ) certain here . ( viius ) * persuade whom buy t ( ) ? mlc account naturally fact : ( vius ) , " " closer " john " matrix t , thus block attraction " john " ; ( viius ) , " whom " closer matrix cp " " thus block attraction " " . next , kitahara consider proper bind condition violation , show ( x ) . ( ix ) proper bind condition traces must bind . ( x ) * picture t ( ) wonder john likes t ( picture t ( ) ) ? argue proper bind condition analysis ( x ) longer available minimalist approach . condition longer apply s - structure , since s - structure eliminate model , lf reconstruction " picture t ( ) " create configuration trace " " bind . instead , kitahara offer mlc solution . observe ( x ) involve two violation minimal link condition . first , " " closer embed cp " " thus block attraction " " ( note " picture " necessarily carry along " " embed cp independent convergence condition ) . second , illegitimate attraction " " embed cp , " " become closer matrix cp " " , thus block attraction " " . assume ( xus ) derivation employ greater number illegitimate step induce greater degree deviance ( p72 ) derivation ( xius ) below prefer over ( x ) ( x ) involve two violation mlc wherea ( xius ) involve one . ( xius ) ? ? wonder picture t ( ) john likes t ( picture ) ? kitahara extend analysis cross versus nest dependency datum . ( xiius ) nest dependency condition ( pesetsky 1987 ) two " wh " - trace dependency overlap , one must contain . paradigm case those ( xiv ) ( xv ) : ( xiv ) ? ? wonder whom john persuade t ( whom ) buy t ( ) ? ( xv ) ? * whom wonder john persuade t ( whom ) buy t ( ) ? ( xiv ) , kitahara observe , mlc disobey once , raise " " over " whom " matrix cp . ( xv ) , hand , mlc disobey twice , once raise " " over " whom " embed cp , second raise " whom " over " " matrix cp . thus , follow ( ix ) , grammar prefer ( xiv ) over ( xv ) . finally , kitahara consider scramble topicalization german japanese , demonstrate certain restriction phenomenon receive mlc treatment . assume both phenomenon feature drive , scramble / topicalization feature attract element interpretable , thus remains accessible computation after check . basic pattern consider possible scramble element constituent scramble remnant , however possible topicalize remnant . german example provide ( xvus ) ( xvius ) : ( xvus ) scramble + scramble remnant * dass [ t ( da buch ) zu lesen ] keiner [ da buch ] t ( t ( da buch ) zu lesen ) ( book ) read one book ( book read ) versucht hat try " one try read book " ( xvius ) scramble + topicalization remnant [ t ( da buch ) zu lesen ] hat keiner [ da buch ] t ( t ( da buch ) zu lesen ) ( book ) read one book ( book read ) versucht try " one try read book " under assumption , ( xvus ) violate mlc twice , first scramble dp " book " over closer vp " book read " , second scramble vp " t ( book ) read " over now-closer dp " book " . ( xvius ) , hand , violate mlc . assume feature drive topicalization scramble distinct , " book " closest available element scramble feature attract head , since " book read " topicalization feature rather scramble feature . similarly , vp " t ( book ) read " closest available element attract topicalization , since " book " scramble feature topicalization feature . chapter four , kitahara discuss difference deviance between derivation involve one violation mlc wh-element . provide generalization ( xviius ) , example ( xix ) - ( xxius ) ( p83 - 85 ) : ( xviius ) mlc violation involve adjunct , subject , quasus object [ . e . " many " phrase ] far severe mlc violation involve object . ( xix ) adjunct * wonder [ whether john fix car t ( ) ? ( xx ) subject * wonder [ whether t ( ) fix t ( ) ] ? ( xxius ) quasus - object * many pound wonder [ whether john weigh t ( many ) ] ? ( xxius ) object ? ? wonder [ whether john fix t ( ) ] ? order explain phenomenon , kitahara propose follow condition ( p90 ) : ( xxiius ) chain formation condition application move form 1 > 1 chain ( s ) legitimate ( = violation-free ) assume trace attract ( least covertly ) . claim illegitimate wh-movement ( xix ) - ( xxius ) form chain . therefore , wh-element able interpret lf , cause derivation crash . account ungrammaticality ( xix ) - ( xxius ) . ( xxius ) , however , kitahara claim formal feature trace " " raise covertly check accusative case , movement save derivation . ( notice covert movement trace wh-element ( xxiv ) - ( xxvus ) occur . adjunct quasus object check case , subject move overtly check case . ) accord chain formation condition , movement formal feature object , legitimate , form one chain ; particular , form chain between raise position " " matrix cp merge position " " . thus , derivation interpret lf , status mlc violation . kitahara extend analysis ( xxiv ) . ( xxiv ) " where " / " " adjunct ? ? where / wonder [ whether john fix car t ( where / ) ? assume adjunct complement null preposition . therefore , formal feature trace " where " / " " must raise covertly check case null preposition , again create necessary chain between move position " where " / " " matrix cp merge position . chapter conclude book . although book stand solidly foundation previous minimalist syntactic research , remains accessible those well-verse minimalist theory . provide clear explanation detail previous minimalist approach , kitahara 's own proposal . furthermore , relevant derivation present step-by - step , pace design accommodate non-specialist . thus , present opportunity those interest learn research issue minimalist syntax . those familiar minimalist research interest rework application 1995 - style minimalism . anyone convince recent discussion computational complexity local economy ( collin 1997 , johnson & lappin 1997 , yang 1997 , among ) , however , dissatisfy approach , continue rely global economy condition . since , course , everyone convince discussion , note prospective reader criticism . similar note , crucial assumption analysis grammar count , controversial , obviously false . note , regard cyclicity , notoriously problematic case head - movement , chomsky ( 1995 ) manage incorporate " cyclicity " requirement ( force apply before introduction another head derivation ) , again fall outside analysis " cyclicity " . since head - movement require operation replacement , longer clear force apply before another head introduce . perhap serious reformulation strong feature condition . various strong feature condition previous minimalist approach simplify first chapter ( ius ) above , repeat ( xxv ) below . ( xxv ) strong feature condition spell - apply sigma sigma contain category strong feature . difficulty formulation render strong feature condition s - structure condition thus anti - minimalist , since minimalism great pain eliminate s - structure condition . notice trivial reformulate previous s - structure condition manner parallel ( xxv ) - - " spell - apply sigma sigma contain trace bind " - - thus reduce minimalist claim s - structure redundant matter terminology . furthermore , chapter , further condition involve strong feature introduce order rule certain noncyclic derivation . additional condition , ( xxvus ) , essentially weaken version chomsky 's ( 1995 ) formulation strong feature condition . ( xxvus ) alpha beta cannot concatenate sublabel alpha sublabel beta both strong ( p95 ) thus , propose simplification strong feature condition actually result posit two condition , one s - structure condition . another seemingly anti - minimalist proposal chain formation condition , ( xxiius ) above repeat ( xxvius ) below . ( xxvius ) chain formation condition application move form 1 > 1 chain ( s ) legitimate ( = violation-free ) minimalist theory claim computation human language meet inclusiveness condition , . e . element add during course computation . instead , computation arrange rearrange item select lexicon . therefore , under minimalist theory , notion " chain " independent entity exist , add during course derivation , violate inclusiveness . instead , " chain " simply convenient term refer identical element derivation . chain formation condition , however , crucially require chain independent existence computation . comment aside , book represent step forward minimalist research program . kitahara able derive several assumption / principle previously stipulate . account optionality icelandic object shift satisfy " optional strong feature " approach , although , note , raise cross - linguistic consideration ( e . g . french ) . systematic application minimal link condition datum capture various condition sorely need , confirm intuition mlc equal , superior , empirical coverage . finally , analysis " wh " extraction asymmetry present final chapter , one few minimalist treatment phenomenon . , reader book consider , clearly explain , thought-provoke . biography julie anne legate phd student department linguistic philosophy mit . research interest include syntactic theory irish syntax . bibliography chomsky , noam .
