" word " title refer two claim g&m : one , child 's early vocabulary reflect technical notion theory du jour two , linguistic element act part evidence child theory build . book divide three section , addition introduction conclusion . first section address theoretical commitment theory theory relate theory cognitive organization development . second section examine three domain knowledge evidence child 's change theory . third section neo - whorfian flavor address question different language effect child 's theory-build . part 1 : theory theory section , g&m face head certainly most difficult claim swallow , namely child 's early theory world qualitatively same scientific theory subject revision same . while acknowledge many difference between scientist infant operate , nevertheless maintain both construct same sort theory same . theory both abstract general , therefore provide means prediction variety domain . both group concern match theory world maintain theory long evidence support . evidence mount against theory , theory holder transitional state , actively seek sort evidence , conduct experiment develop technical vocabulary settle better theory . one g&m 's strong claim standard adult theory ( so-cal " folk-physic " " folk-psychology " , e . g . ) principle open revision ; develop response inadequate child theory world , , scientific theory , too revise , need arise . second chapter section compare theory theory two prominent cognitive model , modularity empirical generalization ( e . g . , script , connectionism ) . g&m present theory theory substitute either model completely over role each . thus , respect modularity , theory theory account many central cognitive process less perceptually orient modular process ; respect empirical generalization , theory theory better equip deal thing causal linkage provide deeper level explanation general , generalization still form important basis creation theory . part 2 : evidence theory theory part 2 consist three chapter each different knowledge domain show theory theory explain child 's development area . chapter 4 deal child 's theory appearance address child 's development respect object permanence . chapter 5 child 's theory action causality animate inanimate thing . chapter 5 address child 's develop theory natural kind . each chapter discuss adult theory each domain marshal experimental evidence demonstrate infant 's initial theory subsequent revision theory child . each domain , argue child crucial theory change around age 9 month again around age 18 month . g&m report result many experiment ( large number conduct g / m themselve ) amply illustrate child 's competence domain change ( improve ) age . experimental evidence augment anecdotal account infant affectively interact different task different age . g&m scientific behavior child therefore important child pass task older ( theory better ) view task differently older . point example emotional consternation infant show around theory putatively change . thus , 15 month old fail object secretly move hide place unperturb failure ; 21 month old object place unimpress own success . 18 month old , however , both deeply disturb fail ( structure task whole ) joyful success . g&m argue affective difference reflect something blase-ness normal science compare eureka moment mark theory change . respect linguistics , one claim chapter early utterance correspond technical vocabulary newly form theory . g&m 's argument particularly intrigue respect performative utterance , " " " uhoh " quite frequent speech 18 month old largely ignore language acquisition study . claim , example , emergence word " " child speech closely link child 's ability solve invisible displacement task ( object secretly move hide place ) . " gone " indicate object sight reason , effect technical term , reflect concept infant 's theory . part 3 : language thought previous chapter , kind evidence g&m suggest drive theory formation revision arise primarily child 's interaction object , action world . chapter , g&m note language itself part child 's world different language principle provide different kind evidence . since child 's theory innately presume construct basis evidence world , different kind linguistic evidence lead different theory , least different rate theory formation . support effect language theory build series longitudinal , crosslinguistic study child acquire korean english . cover experiment detail , gist appear korean verb-centric while english noun-centric linguistic difference translate korean child develop theory action quickly english counterpart , turn , develop theory natural kind quickly korean child . evaluation despite fact theory theory inform active psychological research program , book primarily book philosophy . thus , result large number experimental investigation discuss one experiment discuss sufficient detail critically evaluate . reader already acquaint cognitive developmental literature themselve somewhat confuse ( perhap somewhat unconvince ) g&m able draw conclusion experiment report . problem remedy extent detail explanation one two experiment act representative example diagram depict sort task test infant . few diagram / summary table helpful general . theory theory dynamic form g&m trace two three theory change within three different knowledge domain . critical point theory change through clearly , many detail lose mass information ; summary table describe different theory ( perhap evidence lead theory revision ) useful reference . although g&m devote entire chapter persuade reader infant theory development scientific theory development same , ultimately argument remains unconvince insistence point throughout book effect lessen force claim , rather strengthen . many reason skeptical link between two set theory builder most compel reason reject argument seem grave injustice entrenchment our folk-scientific reason . nutshell , our adult folk-science stable level knowledge , even principle , subject revision . g&m try argue against powerful intuition two . first , point fact science move beyond our folk theory , those theory can't word true . while agree einsteinian physics probably true ( . e . , better model world ) own folk-physic , ' m still stick inadequate theory . g&m appeal division knowledge-labor claim theory really change societal level , highlight fact common person , our folk-science unrevisable . g&m 's second argument our folk-science open revision imagine world require different theory , frequently invoke tv show star trek illustrate world . fantasy argument leave entirely cold , partially strong intuition ( g&m seem ) , example , status object star trek transporter beam , partially believe place far heavy burden piece popular fiction . note , however , reject most extreme g&m 's claim fundamentally undermine argument knowledge organize around theory developmental change reflect change child 's theory . even child 's theory same type scientific theory , analyze our knowledge term kind theory child 's development form theory change still intrigue compel perspective . sum , g&m raise number extremely interest question nature knowledge representation , nature theory , nature cognitive development relationship language cognitive development . offer theory theory address question , although one believe theory theory actually answer , certainly important view debate . review laura wagner , department psychology , university massachusett - amherst . research center child 's acquisition tense aspect .
