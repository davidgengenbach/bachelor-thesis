The objective of the SHORE project is to design, implement, and
evaluate a persistent object system that will serve the needs of a wide
variety of target applications including hardware and software CAD
systems, persistent programming languages, geographic information
systems, satellite data repositories, and multi-media applications.

ways including support for typed objects, multiple programming
languages, a "Unix-like" hierarchical name space for named objects, and
a Unix-compatible interface to objects with a "text" field. This
interface is intended to ease the transition of applications from the
Unix file system environment to Shore as existing Unix tools such as vi
and cc will be able to store their data in Shore objects without
modification (basically a Unix file becomes either a single Shore
object or the text field of a more complex object).<P>

<A NAME="Overview">Overview:</A>
</H2>
SHORE is something of a hybrid system by nature, inheriting
characteristics both from object-oriented database systems and from
file systems.  This section briefly describe the basic features of
SHORE.  The paper,
<!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><A HREF="file://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/tech-reports/reports/94/tr1222.ps.Z">
Shoring Up Persistent Applications</A>,
describes SHORE in much greater detail.

SHORE has three major goals:
<UL>
<LI>Scalability
<LI>Support for hardware and language heterogeneity
<LI>Support for existing, file-based applications
</UL>

When the SHORE project began 3 years ago, these goals were unique
among the research and commercial OODBMS community.  While the
<!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><A HREF="http://www.odmg.org:3083"> ODMG effort </A>
has also concentrated on providing some degree of support for language
heterogeneity (which, in turn, facilitates hardware heterogeneity),
SHORE remains distinguished by its focus on scalability and support
for applications that depend on the Unix file system for persistent
storage.  Furthermore, since the SHORE data model (SDL) is basically
<!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><A HREF="#foot1">
compatible with the ODMG data model (ODL)</A>,
we expect that much of the technology that we develop can eventually be
transferred to the commercial sector.

<H3>Scalable Architecture</H3>
SHORE's software architecture is unique is several ways.
First, SHORE uses a symmetric, peer-to-peer distributed
architecture.  In SHORE, every participating processor runs a
SHORE server process <em>whether or not the processor has SHORE data disks</em>
attached.  The software has been designed to be scalable;
it can run on a single processor, a network of workstations, or
a large parallel processor such as the Intel Paragon or IBM SP1/2.
This design is in contrast to the client-server architecture
used by EXODUS and all the OODBMS vendors.  While a client-server
architecture is fine for a design environment such as is typically
used in software and hardware CAD efforts, it is not scalable.
<P>
The second unique feature of the SHORE architecture is its notion
of a ``value-added'' server.  By structuring the software that runs
in the server with extensibility in mind, it is relatively simple for
users to build application-specific servers.  For example, the
<!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~jignesh/paradise.html">
Paradise project </A>
is already using the SHORE server to build a geographic information system for
<!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><A HREF="http://eos.nasa.gov/"> NASA's
EOSDIS project.
</A>
<P>
We feel that these two unique pieces of technology will play a
important role in a variety of future research and commercial endeavors.
For example, the digital libraries of the future will almost certainly
depend on the availability of scalable, persistent object technology.
Such systems are going to store, retrieve, manipulate, and transmit
objects containing video and pictures as well as text.  While
current OODBMS products could be used, these systems are oriented
toward dealing with gigabytes, and not terabytes, of data.
Customizability is equally important.  The indexing, retrieval,
and query processing mechanisms needed for a digital library
are very different from those required for a geographic information
system.

<H3>Language and Hardware Heterogeneity</H3>

Objects in SHORE are typed.  SHORE provides a single, language-neutral
type system that is used to define the types of all SHORE objects.
This type system is embodied in the SHORE Data Language (SDL),
which is the language in which SHORE object types are defined.
SDL enhances the OMG data model IDL with support for database
features such as bulk types (e.g., sets and lists) and persistence.
The provision of typed persistent objects simplifies the task of
supporting heterogeneous hardware environments and makes it feasible
to support access to persistent objects from multiple programming
languages, which is a key objective of the SHORE project.
As mentioned earlier, SDL is quite closely related to ODL,
the language-neutral object type definition language that was
recently proposed as a standard by the OODB vendor consortium ODMG.
In terms of its emphasis, however, ODMG has largely concentrated on
providing a standardized interface to existing C++ oriented OODBs.
Our focus is on support for inter-language object sharing within
a large name-space of objects.

<H3>Support for Existing, File-based Applications</H3>

A major goal of SHORE is to enable applications that currently
use untyped, byte-oriented files for their persistent data,
flattening and un-flattening their data each time it is accessed,
to stop doing so.
Such applications should be able to store their data as typed, structured
objects for more convenient, type-safe, intra- and inter-program data sharing.
Our ultimate hope is that SHORE will displace byte-oriented
file systems such as the Unix file system.
<P>
SHORE provides two major services from a file system standpoint.  First,
to support object naming and space management in a world with many
persistent objects, SHORE provides a flexible, tree-structured,
Unix-like name-space in which all persistent objects are reachable,
either directly or indirectly.  Doing so gives SHORE users
a familiar framework in which to register individual
persistent objects (termed "registered" objects), the roots of
large persistent data structures, or bulk sets of unnamed objects (termed
"anonymous" objects).  The realization of this framework involves
several different kinds of SHORE file system objects, including
directories, pools (which are files containing anonymous objects),
symbolic links, and cross references.
<P>
SHORE provides two mechanisms to ease the transition of legacy Unix
applications such as compilers, editors, and CAD systems from
traditional byte-stream files to SHORE.
First, for applications that can be re-linked, SHORE provides a standard
Unix-compatible file system interface  (e.g. open, close, read,
write, mkdir, chdir,.).
In order to make access to SHORE objects via Unix file system calls
possible, the definer of a SHORE object type can optionally designate one
variable-length byte string or character string attribute of the object as
being the object's "Unix data".  Programs that attempt to read an object
through SHORE counterparts of the Unix file system calls
will only see this portion of the object. For legacy programs that
wish to do so without being re-linked, it is possible to NFS-mount a
SHORE file system and access the Unix data
contained in its objects directly.  This makes it feasible for both
new and old applications to access the same set of objects.
While old applications can only access the "Unix data" component
of the object, new applications can define and access other, more
structured, attributes of the object.

<DL><A NAME=foot1><DT>... compatibility with ODL<DD>
SHORE and ODMG concurrently decided to use the OMG data model

are very similar to one another.  Once ODL stabilizes
we can convert SDL to be 100% compatible with ODL.
