<H4> A number of important database applications require the processing
of large amounts of ordered <em> sequence </em> data. The domains of these
applications include financial management, historical analysis,
economic and social sciences, metereology, medical sciences and
biological sciences. Existing relational databases are inadequate in 
this regard; data collections are treated as sets, not sequences. 
Consequently, expressing sequence queries is tedious, and evaluating 
them is inefficient.</H4>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Databases should 
<UL>
<LI>model the data using the abstraction of <em> sequences </em>,
<LI>allow data sequences to be queried in a <em> declarative manner </em>,
utilizing the ordered semantics
<LI>take advantage of the unique opportunities available for query 
optimization and evaluation
<LI>integrate sequence data with relational data, so that users can
store and query a combination of relation and sequences
</UL>
These requirements serve as the goals of the SEQ project.
Various kinds of sequences need to be supported, temporal sequences being the
most important kind. Queries should be expressible using notions like
"next" and "previous" which are natural when considering sequences.
These queries should be optimized so that they can be evaluated efficiently.
These issues need to be studied in theory, and then a database system needs 
to be built that demonstrates the feasibility of the theoretical ideas.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The current status of the project is:
<ul>
<li>We have defined the <em> SEQ </em> data model that can support 
most important kinds of sequence data. We have also defined algebraic
query operators that can be composed to form sequence queries (analogous
to the composition of relational algebra operators to form relation queries).
<li>We have described how sequence queries can be efficiently processed,
and have identified various optimization techniques.
<li>We use a sequence query language <em> Sequin </em> that can
declaratively express queries over sequences. A <em> Sequin </em>
query can include embedded expressions in a relational query language like
SQL, or vice-versa.
<li>We are building a disk-based database system to demonstrate the 
feasibility of our proposals. The system implements the <em> SEQ </em> 
model using a nested complex object architecture. It is built over the 
SHORE storage manager and can process several megabytes of data.
Relations and sequences are supported in an integrated and extensible 
manner.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A weather monitoring system records information about various meteorological 
phenomena. There is a sequentiality in the occurrence of these phenomena; the 
various meteorological events are sequenced by the time at which they are 
recorded. A scientist asks the query: 
<p>
<!WA17><!WA17><!WA17><!WA17><!WA17><!WA17><!WA17><!WA17><!WA17><!WA17><!WA17><!WA17><img src="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~praveen/pics/redball.gif"> <em> "For which volcano eruptions did
the most recent earthquake have a strength greater than 7.0 on the Richter 
scale?"</em>. 
<p>
If this query is to be expressed in a relational query language like SQL, 
complex features like groupby clauses, correlated subqueries and aggregate
functions are required. Further, a conventional relational query optimizer 
would not find an efficient query execution plan, even given the knowledge 
that the Earthquakes and Volcano relations are sorted by time.
<p>
However a very efficient plan exists, if one models the data as sequences
ordered by time. The two sequences can be scanned in lock step 
(similar to a sort merge join). The most recent earthquake record scanned 
can be stored in a temporary buffer. Whenever a volcano record is 
processed, the value of the most recent earthquake record stored in the 
buffer is checked to see if its strength was greater than 7.0, possibly 
generating an answer. This query can therefore be processed with a single 
scan of the two sequences, and using very little memory. The key to such 
optimization is the sequentiality of the data and the query.

<A NAME="Data Model"><H2>Data Model</H2></A>
<H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The details of the <em> SEQ </em> data model are
described in a published paper (click <!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><!WA18><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~praveen/papers/seq.de95.ps">here </a>
for postscript version). Here we present the gist of it.

The basic model of a sequence is a set of records mapped to an ordered
domain of ``positions''.
This many-to-many relationship between records and
positions can be viewed in two dual but distinct ways: as a set of records
mapped to each position, or as a set of positions mapped to each record.
These two views are called ``Positional'' and ``Record-Oriented'' respectively,
and each gives rise to a set of query operators based on that view.
Queries on sequences could require operators of either or both flavors. 
The Record-Oriented operators are similar to relational
operators and include various kinds of joins (overlap, containment, etc) and
aggregates. Such operators have been extensively explored by researchers
in the temporal database community.
<p>
<!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><img src="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~praveen/projects/sequence.gif" ALT="(Picture of Sequence Mapping)">
<p>
The Positional operators include Next, Previous, Offset, Moving
Aggregates, etc.  Further operators allow ``zooming'' operations on 
sequences by means of collapsing and expanding the ordering domains 
associated with the sequence. For instance, a daily sequence could be 
``zoomed out'' (i.e.collapsed) to a weekly sequence, or ``zoomed in'' 
(i.e. expanded) to an hourly sequence. 

The last part of the model deals with operations on groups (i.e. sets) of 
sequences. The advantage is that this makes it easy to model queries 
involving sequence collections (which is the case in many real-world
situations). All the sequence operators are extended to work with groups 
of similar sequences, instead of with single sequences. This extension
of the SEQ model indicates that a practical implementation of
SEQ would probably involve a nested complex object system.

<A NAME="Language"><H2><em> Sequin </em> Query Language</H2></A>
<H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have devised a query language called <em> Sequin </em> using
which declarative sequence queries can be specified. The language
is similar in flavor to SQL, except that the inputs to queries
as well as the results of queries are sequences. Click

<A NAME="Optimization"><H2>Optimization Techniques</H2></A>
<H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have proposed new optimization techniques for sequence queries 
involving Positional operators. There are existing techniques that
have been proposed for queries with Record-Oriented operators.
Our optimizations use query transformations, meta--data, and caching of 
intermediate results to efficiently evaluate a query. An optimal query 
evaluation plan can be generated using an algorithm that relies on cost 
estimates. One of the important observations is that accessing sequence data 
in a single stream is probably very efficient, and evaluation strategies 
should take this into account.
<p>
The details of the optimization techniques are
described in a published paper (click <!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~praveen/papers/seq.sigmod94.ps">here </a>

The SEQ database system has a client-server
architecture, supporting multiple clients via
a multi-threaded server. The server is built on
top of the <!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/shore/">SHORE </a> 
storage manager. Both <em> Sequin </em>
and a subset of SQL are supported as query languages
which can be embedded inside each other. The data model
is a nested complex object model that allows arbitrary
levels of nesting of relations inside sequences and vice
versa. The system is also extensible, providing support
for new data types, new ordering domains, user-defined functions, 
new storage implementations and new query languages. For more details
