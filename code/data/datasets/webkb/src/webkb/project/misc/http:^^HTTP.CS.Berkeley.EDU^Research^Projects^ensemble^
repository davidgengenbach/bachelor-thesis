<title>The Ensemble Project</title>
<!-- Changed by: Brian F. Dennis,  5-Sep-1995 -->

<h1>Ensemble</h1>

The Ensemble Project is a research effort in the
<!WA0><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/">Computer Science Division</a>
of the
<!WA1><a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">University of California, Berkeley</a>. 
The principal investigators are 
Professors
<!WA2><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~graham">
Susan Graham</a> and
<!WA3><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~harrison">
Michael Harrison</a>.

We are investigating the use of the latest programming language technology
for the task of software construction and maintenance. Our ultimate goal is
a high quality development environment emphasizing the editing and
integration of all artifacts of the software life cycle: programs,
documentation, specification, performance analyses, etc., as well as the
creation and maintenance of software content.  Software artifacts are
regarded as structured multimedia documents, where the structure and
semantics are essential to understanding the document content. Current
advances in incremental analysis and maintenance of document structure,
semantics, and content allow us to develop new technology for editing
structured documents and presenting multimedia.
