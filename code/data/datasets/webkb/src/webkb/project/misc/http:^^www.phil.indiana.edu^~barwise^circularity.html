<Blockquote>
Ciruclarity is a widespread phenomena in computer science.  This has
led Peter Aczel and others to develop a richer notion of set emboddied
in the antifounded universe of hypersets. This project is devoted to
applying this theory in comptuer science and to developing the theory
of hypersets in response to needs from such applications.   Barwise
and Moss are currently finishing <strong> Vicious Circles </strong>, a book on this topic.
