This page is under construction, and will be fleshed out with more
detailed information soon.

L0 (Also called L-zero) is a research project in computational
semantics headed by <!WA1><a
href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~jfeldman">Jerry Feldman</a> of <!WA2><a
href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/">the International Computer
Science Institute</a> and George Lakoff of the U.C. Berkeley
Department of Linguistics.  <!WA3><A
href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~shastri">Lokendra Shastri</a> is
another senior researcher on the project.  

<p>
There is a mailing list for discussion of lzero issues and
announcements of lzero meetings.  It is at lzero@icsi.berkeley.edu.
To subscribe, send mail to <!WA4><a href="mailto:lzero-request@icsi.berkeley.edu">
lzero-request@icsi.berkeley.edu</a>.

<p>
A Good first place to look for information is the paper <!WA5><a
href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/ftp/global/pub/ai/lzero/first_five_years.ps.Z">Lzero:
The First Five Years</a>.
<p>
The current set of Graduate Students working on the project is
<ul>
<li> <!WA6><a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~dbailey">David Bailey</a>
<li> <!WA7><a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~snarayan">Srini Narayan</a>
<li> <!WA8><a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~jsegal">Jonathan Segal</a>
</ul>

The first thesis to come directly out of the L-zero project was that of <!WA9><a
href="http://www.ccp.uchicago.edu/faculty/Terry_Regier/">Terry
Regier</a>, who is now a professor at the University of Chicago.  His
research produced a structured connectionist model which could
learn to categorize spatial scenes with spatial prepositions from a
variety of natural languages, without using negative evidence.  A
short paper version of his research can be found as:<p>

Terry (1995).  A model of the human capacity for categorizing spatial
relations, <i>Cognitive Linguistics,</i> vol. 6, no. 1,
pp. 63-88.</a><p>

The second thesis to come directly out of the project was that of <!WA11><a
href="http://www-speech.sri.com/people/stolcke/index.html">Andreas
Stolcke</a>.  His research focussed on the bayesian learning of
probabilistic language models.  His thesis can be found as:<p>

of Probabilistic Language Models (UC Berkeley thesis)</A>

If you don't want to read his whole thesis, you can read the
