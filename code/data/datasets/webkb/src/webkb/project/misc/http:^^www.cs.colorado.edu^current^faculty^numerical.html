<h2>
   Research Interests 
</h2>

<p>
The numerical computation research group is concerned with
developing, analyzing, implementing, and testing methods for
solving mathematical problems on computers.  It is also
concerned with applications of numerical methods to scientific
and engineering applications, and with languages and tools 
for numerical computation.  There is considerable emphasis
on the development of methods for parallel computers.

<p>
Specific areas of emphasis within the group include optimization
and nonlinear equations (Byrd, Schnabel), partial differential
equations (Cai, McBryan), eigenvalue problems (Jessup), and
languages and tools for parallel computation (Jessup, Schnabel).
Currently there is also considerable emphasis on applications
from molecular chemistry (Byrd, Schnabel), astrophysics (McBryan),
space structures (McBryan), and combustion and chaotic systems (Bradley).

<p>
Courses and a textbook in
<!WA6><a href = "http://www.cs.colorado.edu/ftp/pub/HPSC/README.html>
   High Performance Scientific Computing
</a>
have been developed for both undergraduates and graduate students.
A specially equipped laboratory, the HPSC lab, provides computing support
for these courses.

<h2>
   Major Funded Research Projects
</h2>

The main funded research projects in this area include:

<ul>
   <li> High performance computing issues for turbulence and aeroelastic
           simulation -- funded by ARPA, NSF, and NASA, including an 
           NSF Grand Challenge grant and a NASA Grand Challenge grant
   <li> Large-scale optimization methods, with emphasis on applications   
           from molecular chemistry -- funded by AFOSR, ARO, NSF
   <li> Numerical methods for structured sparse matrix problems --
           funded by DOE 
   <li> Domain decomposition methods for partial differential equations  --
           funded by NSF
</ul>

<p>
In addition, each faculty member in this group who was eligible
to compete for an NSF Young Investigator award -- Bradley, Cai,
and Jessup -- has received this award.
