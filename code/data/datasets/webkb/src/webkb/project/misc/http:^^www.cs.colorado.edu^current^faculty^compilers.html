<h2>
   Research Interests 
</h2>

<p>
Programming language research at the University of Colorado
encompasses design, translation and run-time support.
Our interests span the spectrum, including problems of visual, functional and
object-oriented languages as well as mainstream languages like C and
FORTRAN.
Our emphasis is on practical and experimental work rather than theory.
We have a number of industrial partnerships, and make many of our results
available as running software.

<p>
Specific interests of group members are
the structure and applications of visual languages (Citrin),
methods for improving the performance of object-oriented languages
(Grunwald).
and appropriate techniques to generate optimized code for standard languages
on modern computers (Grunwald, Zorn).
A long-running project is concerned with providing executable
specifications for the entire compilation process and automating the
production of the compiler from them (Waite).

<h2>
   Major Funded Research Projects
</h2>

The main funded research projects in this area include:

<ul>

   <li> High performance environments and languages -- funded by ARPA and
           carried out in cooperation with Indiana University and
	   the University of Oregon
   <p>
   <li> Completely visual programming languages and environments - funded
	   by the Colorado Advanced Software Institute (CASI) and US WEST
	   Technologies.  See
	   <!WA5><a href="http://soglio.colorado.edu/Web/vipr.html">VIPR</a>
	   for more information.  Investigators: Wayne Citrin and Ben Zorn.

</ul>


<h2>
   Facilities
</h2>

Experimental projects in the programming languages area depend on
considerable software infrastructure in addition to the department's
normal complement of compilers, editors and word processors.
Currently these include:

<ul>

   <li> ATOM -- A program instrumentation tool that supports detailed
	   measurements of program performance for both user code and
	   the kernel.
   <p>
   <li> The
	   <!WA6><a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~eliuser">
           Eli System </a>
	   -- A domain-specific programming environment for translator
           construction.
   <p>
   <li> Newtonscript programming environment. An object-oriented programming
           environment for construction of pen-based applications - including
           programming environments - on the Apple Newton Messagepad PDA.
	   A C++ environment for the Newton should be available soon.

</ul>
