<Strong>Description: </Strong>
<blockquote>
Analog field computing addresses the theory, design, implementation, and applications of analog computers including at least one component that can be treated mathematically as a field.  VLSI field computers were first implemented at Indiana University's Analog VLSI and Robotics Laboratory. They are currently being applied as <!WA0><A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/jwmills/PROJECTS/retic.proj.html">artificial neural field networks</A>, silicon retinas and controllers for <!WA1><A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/jwmills/PROJECTS/mr.proj.html">Stiquito and Robozoa robots</A>, morphogenesis simulators, <!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/jwmills/PROJECTS/cyc.proj.html">controllers for the IU cyclotron</A>, and matrix preconditioners.
