<h1> The DART Project</h1>

The Document Analysis and Recognition at Tufts Project is working
toward intelligent computer understanding of printed media.  The 
research covers a variety of fields, including Natural Language 
Processing, Fuzzy Logic, and Digital Image Processing.  Ongoing
projects include semantic based structure analysis,  image analysis,
and composite structure recognition. <P>
