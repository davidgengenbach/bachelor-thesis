Theproject's approach is pragmatic:  to develop, build, andprime with data a prototype testbed of an on-lineelectronic library using the technology and systemconfigurations expected to be economically feasible in theyear 2000.  The initial data is the accumulated collectionof M. I. T. Computer Science Technical Reports, in the formof scanned images.<p>Our basic hypothesis is that the technology of on-linestorage, display, and communications will soon make iteconomically possible to place the entire contents of anylibrary on-line and make them accessible from computerworkstations located anywhere.  Our vision is that one willbe able to browse any book, journal, paper, thesis, orreport using an ordinary personal computer, and followcitations by pointing--the report or paper selected shouldpop up immediately in an adjacent window.<p>Our goal is not to invent or develop any of these evolvingtechnologies, but rather to work out how to harness them. The engineering and deployment of large-scale systems isalways accompanied by traps and surprises beyond thoseapparent in the component technologies.  Typical researchtopics include discovering wanted items, robustly linkingto information across the network, and making on-lineinformation endure, reliably, for decades.</BODY><p><!WA4><a href="http://www.lcs.mit.edu/web_project/Brochure/contents.html"><!WA5><img align=left src=http://www.lcs.mit.edu/web_project/Brochure/icons/contents_motif.gif></a><!WA6><a href="http://www.lcs.mit.edu/web_project/Brochure/lps/lps.html"><!WA7><img align=left src=http://www.lcs.mit.edu/web_project/Brochure/icons/previous_group_motif.gif></a><!WA8><a href="http://www.lcs.mit.edu/web_project/Brochure/pdos/pdos.html"><!WA9><img align=left src=http://www.lcs.mit.edu/web_project/Brochure/icons/next_group_motif.gif></a></HTML>
