Computer Languages and Software Systems (CLASS Lab)
<P>
The faculty is widely involved in research into programming language
design and implementation. Design interests include language features
to support functional, logic and/or object-oriented programming styles
as well as facilities for parallelism, distributed computing and
programming-in-the-large. Implementation interests include language
processors, run-time support, program manipulation tools and software
engineering environments.
