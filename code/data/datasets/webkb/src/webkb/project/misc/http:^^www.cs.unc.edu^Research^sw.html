<STRONG> Description </STRONG>:

We are developing a new abstraction,
called a flexible shared window,
that allows users to efficienty see different
views of a
shared window.
Specifically, we are
investigating multiple, linked versions of a shared window,
dynamic migration
and replication of window clients,
a hierarchical, file-system-like naming scheme for distributed windows,
<!WA5><A HREF = "ftp://ftp.cs.unc.edu/pub/users/jeffay/papers/WETICE-94.ps.Z">
a distributed window architecture
</A>
that inverts the traditional architecture,
and a modular implementation scheme based on the notion
of connecting protocol filters.
If successful,
this research will lead to a new class of systems,
called flexible shared window systems,
that can be used to more flexibly and efficiently share

existing collaboration-unaware applications/toolkits

and more easily implement
new
<!WA7><A HREF = "ftp://ftp.cs.unc.edu/pub/users/dewan/papers/trends.ps.Z">
collaboration-aware applications/ toolkits.

We propose to implement on top of both the X window system and the Java
window layer.
