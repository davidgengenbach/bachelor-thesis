<P>

The IUE is a public domain, comprehensive software environment for
performing advanced research in <!WA2><A HREF="http://www.aai.com/AAI/IU/IU.html">Image
Understanding</A> (IU). The primary goal of the IUE is to promote research
productivity and to facilitate the exchange of research results among IU
researchers.  To this end, the IUE provides
<UL>
<LI> an extensive C++ class hierarchy for representing a wide
     range of objects, images, image features, and processes
<LI> a well-documented, modular, standard object-oriented interface
<LI> implementation of established IU algorithms
<LI> the ability to exploit and coordinate the processing power of exitsing
     IU tools and systems
</UL>

<P>

In August 1993, <!WA3><A HREF="http://ftp.arpa.mil/">ARPA</A> announced the award
of the prime development contract for the Image Understanding Environment
(IUE) to <!WA4><A HREF="http://www.aai.com">Amerinex Artificial
Intelligence, `.  Inc</A>.  AAI is currently in the second year of a staged
three-year development effort to implement the IUE.

<P>

The development of the IUE will be performed in close coordination with 
the continued development of other Amerinex's other IU products.  In
particular, the <!WA5><A HREF="http://www.aai.com/AAI/KBV/KBV.html">KBVision</A> (TM) System will
continue to be enhanced, and as appropriate, compatibility products will be
developed to allow users of KBVision System products to exchange data with
IUE users.
