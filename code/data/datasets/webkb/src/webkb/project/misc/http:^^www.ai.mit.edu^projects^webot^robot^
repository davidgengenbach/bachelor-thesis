Entering into the control page will allow you interact with a remote environment through a robot located at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  There are various things you can do and some interesting Virtual Reality aspects to the page.  This project, called the TransReality project, is one of several being worked on by the Virtual Worlds Group, headed by Dr. David Brock, at the AI Lab.<p>
