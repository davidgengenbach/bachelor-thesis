<H1>Optimization of Rule Condition Testing in Active Database
Systems</H1>
<P>This project is investigating ways to optimize testing of complex
trigger conditions in active databases.  It is funded by a grant from
NSF.  The principle  investigator is Eric Hanson.  Students who are
working (or have worked) on the project include Mohammed Hasan,
Jayashree Rangarajan, Goutam Kulkarni,  Sreenath Bodagala, and Yi Gao. 
See the <!WA0><A HREF="http://www.cis.ufl.edu/cis/tech-reports">technical
reports</A> from 1993 for a discussion of the Gator discrimination
network structure and optimization methods for Gator.  Additional
publications are under development.  We are currently extending the
Ariel active DBMS with an optimized rule condition testing mechanism.
