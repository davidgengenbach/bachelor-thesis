The Graphics Research Group is interested in developing computer
graphics tools to assist humans in the synthesis (design or
composition), control, and analysis of complex interactive systems. Our
approach centres on developing better techniques for problem
visualization. We have active projects involving animation of human
movement, intelligent computer aided design, intelligent graphics
interfaces for complex control systems, and the specification and
representation of complex shapes. We have strong interactions with the
AI group and most projects have industrial collaborators.
