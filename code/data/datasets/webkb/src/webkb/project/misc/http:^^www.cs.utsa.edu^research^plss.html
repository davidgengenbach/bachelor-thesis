<H1>Programming Languages and Systems Software Laboratory</H1>

The programming languages and systems software laboratory investigates
fundamental issues in software systems, including language design and
implementation, execution monitoring and program visualization, 
object-oriented and distributed systems, and software engineering.

<B>The Alamo Monitor Framework Project </B></A>
(<!WA3><A href="http://www.cs.utsa.edu/faculty/jeffery.html">C. Jeffery</A>)
<DD> Alamo is a framework for monitoring the execution of programs.
     Alamo supports two programming languages: ANSI C and Icon.
     It consists of two components: the Alamo Monitor Executive (AME)
     implements a shared-address, coroutine based thread model of monitoring;
     the Configurable C Instrumentation (CCI) tool is an ANSI C preprocessor
     that provides automatic software instrumentation at a semantic level,
     as opposed to manual instrumentation or instrumentation at the machine-,
     lexical-, or syntactic levels.

<DD> The Proxy-Sharing Proxy Server is an extension of the CERN Web server
     that investigates the application of wide-area demand-driven replication
     techniques to sharing WWW resources.  Our caching scheme is
     <em>non-hierarchial</em>, allowing it to scale and fit the natural
     topology of the internet better than existing schemes.

   and the <!WA9><A href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/www/">
   Icon Project</A> at the U. of Arizona)
<DD> Icon is a very-high level general purpose language featuring a rich
     set of built-in datatypes, a familiar C-like syntax, a novel goal-directed
     expression evaluation mechanism, and easy to use portable graphics
     facilities.  Current work includes improvements in performance,
     reductions in space requirements, porting the graphics facilities to
     additional platforms, and adding object-oriented facilities.

<B>Very High-Level Language Benchmarks</B></A>
(C. Jeffery)
<DD> Several very-high level languages are now in vogue, such as
     Perl, Tcl, and Java.  Although each has its unique specialties,
     each claims to be a general-purpose tool, and to the extent that
     they are general-purpose, they can be compared by implementing
     a set of benchmark applications in each language.  Timing results
     provide feedback to language implementors about neglected facilities,
     and the implementation experience reveals missing features and
     obstacles encountered when using these languages as general-purpose tools.

<DT><!WA11><A name=softviz href="http://www.cs.utsa.edu/research/softviz/">
<B> Software Visualization at UTSA </B> </A>
(C. Jeffery)
<DD> Software visualization is the use of visualization techniques to
portray static and dynamic aspects about a software system's control
flow, data structures, behavior and operation.
