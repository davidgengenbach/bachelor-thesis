Some of the tools are lightweight -- that is, theyare quick and easy to use. LCLint, for example, supportsprogramming with data abstractions in ANSI C by detectingobvious conflicts between code and interfacespecifications.<p>Other tools are more heavyweight and so require more timeand expertise. The theorem-proving system called LP, forinstance, supports reasoning (in first-order logic) aboutthe properties of abstractions and designs. Proofs, likedesigns, must be created, debugged, and maintained. SinceLP is used early in the design process to find designflaws, it treats proving as an activity similar toprogramming. All Larch tools support incrementaldevelopment in that they work with partial specifications,but repay larger specification investments with largerdividends in analysis.<p>The Larch project is becoming increasingly involved withthe design of parallel and distributed systems. Our aim isto develop a useful set of abstractions and implementationtechniques for producing concurrent interactive symbolicapplications.</BODY><p><!WA9><a href="http://www.lcs.mit.edu/web_project/Brochure/contents.html"><!WA10><img align=left src=http://www.lcs.mit.edu/web_project/Brochure/icons/contents_motif.gif></a><!WA11><a href="http://www.lcs.mit.edu/web_project/Brochure/sig/sig.html"><!WA12><img align=left src=http://www.lcs.mit.edu/web_project/Brochure/icons/previous_group_motif.gif></a><!WA13><a href="http://www.lcs.mit.edu/web_project/Brochure/sct/sct.html"><!WA14><img align=left src=http://www.lcs.mit.edu/web_project/Brochure/icons/next_group_motif.gif></a></HTML>
