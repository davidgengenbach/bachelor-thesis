<Blockquote>
This project is the current form of a long term effort by Jon Barwise
to come to grips with the relationship between the concept of
information and logical notions like inference and proof.  What is
information?  What is it that makes your screen carry information
about what is going on at Indiana University? How does this notion of
information fit into standard notions of logic and logical system.
<p>
Over the past year or two, in joint work with Seligman, Barwise has
come to see this problem as one of trying to understand the logical
structure of distributed systems.  This idea has led to a mathematical
framework containing notions like local logic and information channel
which seems very promising.

The project has grown out of work on situation theory, especially with
the STASS Project at CSLI.  Current work is being carried out with Dov
Gabbay at Imperial College, and Jerry Seligman at the
National Chung Cheng University in Taiwan.   Barwise and Seligman are
finishing up a book called <strong> Information Flow in Distributed
Systems </strong>.
