Virtual Reality and Telepresence

<h2>Welcome to the homepage for CMSC 828S Virtual Reality and
Telepresence at the University of Maryland at College Park.</h2>
<p>

VRTP was an experimental course taught by Prof. Ben
Shneiderman in Fall 1993. It is an investigation into the state of the art in
Virtual Reality and Telepresence systems. There were approximately 14
local students and 10 students who saw the class either via satellite
or on tapes that are produced by the Instructional Television (ITV)
facility on campus, and distributed through the National Technological
University. A <!WA0><a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/eve/projects/hcil/vrtp/overview">Course
Overview</a> and 
<!WA1><a href="ftp://umd5.umd.edu/pub/vrtp/syllabus">Syllabus</a> are available
online.

<p>
The course has been novel in its use of electronic mechanisms for
distribution of information to students, and from students to the
instructor. There is a mailing list which enables any person
subscribed to it to easily send electronic mail to all of the people
who are subscribed. We also have an ftp site set up on <!WA2><a
HREF="ftp://umd5.umd.edu/pub/vrtp"> <b>umd5.umd.edu</b></a> to allow anonymous
ftping of files. The local students have also voluntarily taken notes
on what has happened in class and distributed them electronically for
the benefit of the remote students, some of whom have as much as a
week of delay before they see the class.
<p>
All course projects have been collaborative work. The first major
effort is the <!WA3><a HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/eve/eve-main.html"> <b>Encyclopedia of
Virtual Environments (EVE)</b></a>.

The second major project is the 
<!WA4><a href="ftp://umd5.umd.edu/pub/vrtp/Jove/jove-main.html"><b>Journal of Virtual Environments
(JOVE)</b></a>.
