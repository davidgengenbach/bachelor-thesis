        Welcome to the CAISR lab at CWRU
      </center>

    <P>
      <STRONG>
        The CAISR lab is a leader in the integration of state of the art technology for the purpose of building
        intelligent controls and  automated syatems. CAISR  integrates technologies such as Fuzzy Logic, Expert
        Systems and Neural Networks to create flexible systems. One of our current projects is using chaos
        theory to help diagnose impending failure in rotating machinery. Another is using vision based robotic
        control to create a flexible part feeding system in an automated assembly line. This is just a sample of the
        research that the lab is involved with. Read on for more information about the lab and drop us a line if 
        you have any questions. The address is given below.
