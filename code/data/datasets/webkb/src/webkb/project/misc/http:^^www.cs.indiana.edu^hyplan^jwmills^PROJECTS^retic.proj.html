<H2>RETIC: A Behavioral Controller Based on the Vertebrate Reticulate Formation</H2>


<Strong>Description: </Strong>
<Blockquote>
The RETIC behavioral controller was proposed in 1968 by Kilmer, McCullough and Blum - then forgotten for more than 25 years. This is all the more amazing because the original RETIC anticipated work in analog neural nets, Boltzmann machines, neuroethology of behavior, sensor fusion, and the control of android robots...work done by many of today's researchers. Artificial neural field networks (ANFNs) proposed by Mills are ideally suited to implement a VLSI RETIC because they model the larger structure of the reticulate formation.
