The computer networks research group in the 
<!WA3><a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/">Computer
Science Department</a> 
at the 
<!WA4><a href="http://www.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts at Amherst</a>
is led by Professors 
<!WA5><a href="http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/personnel/kurose.html"> Jim Kurose, </a>
and <!WA6><a href="http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/personnel/towsley.html"> Don Towsley. </a>
Our group's research spans a broad range of topic areas,
addressing both subnetwork and host-related issues,
and represents a complementary mix of both theoretical and
applied experimental research.
Much of the group's work is motivated by emerging
broadband high-speed networks and their 
ability to carry a diverse mix of multimedia traffic.

The groups research divides broadly into four areas:

<ul>
<li><!WA7><a href="http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/mcast.html">
	Multicasting </a>
<li><!WA8><a href="http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/ppuma.html">
	Parallelized Protocols for Shared Memory Multiprocessors </a>
<li><!WA9><a href="http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/multimedia.html">	
        Multimedia and Real-Time Communication (currently being updated) </a>
<li><!WA10><a href="http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/modeling.html">	
       Modeling and Performance of Communication Networks </a>
</ul>
