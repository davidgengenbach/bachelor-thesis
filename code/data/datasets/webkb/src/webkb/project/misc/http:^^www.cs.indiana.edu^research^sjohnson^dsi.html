<H2> Daisy/DSI Programming System </H2>



<Strong>Description: </Strong> 
<Blockquote>
DSI is an system for <em> symbolic multiprocessing </em>
based on the underlying operational model of <em> suspending construction </em>.
The fundamental synchronization mechanism in this model is the
<em> suspension </em> a transparent object representing a computation.
Suspensions evolve into manifest data values, which can be inspected and
manipulated by other computations.  Computation is <em> demand oriented, </em>
a relaxation of demand-driven computation in which a system with available
processing resources can speculatively activate suspensions for bounded
execution.  We are interested in this model as a general basis for improving
the performance of limited-scale multiprocessors.

<em> Daisy </em> is a surface language for programming in the DSI system.
Daisy is an applicative language (a mutation of Scheme) with provisions for
exploiting a suspending list constructor.  Among these provisions are
constructs for building networks of streams, including windowing operations
for stream-based I/O.  These facilities make Daisy a good language for
modeling networks of self-timed communicating processes.
