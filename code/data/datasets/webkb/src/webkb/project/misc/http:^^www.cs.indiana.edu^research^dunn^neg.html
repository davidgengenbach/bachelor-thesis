<H2> Negation </H2>



<Strong>Description: </Strong> <Blockquote> This is a study of various
treatements of negation in non-classical logics.  It grows out of my
work on "gaggle theory" wherein negation, being a unary operator, is
given a semantics using a binary "perp" relation. This has precedents
in the model-theoretic definitions of negation in quantum logic and in
linear logic, but is unusual in its application to intuitionistic
logic and relevance logic. This leads to a study of when various 
semantical treatements of negation are equivalent.
