 <H1> Sound Probabilistic Reasoning Project (SPR) </H1> 

 <P> 
Primary Investigator:  <!WA0><A HREF="http://www.cs.usask.ca/homepages/faculty/eric/index.html"> Eric Neufeld </A> .


The SPR project considers probabilistic approaches to a variety of
AI problems traditionally handled by logics, grammars, or heuristics.
Students in the past have look at approximate reasoning, natural language,
reasoning about time, and classification of data.

 <H2>  Logic programming </H2> 
  <P> 
Working jointly with  <!WA1><A HREF="http://www.cs.usask.ca/homepages/faculty/kusalik/Kusalik.html"> Tony Kusalik </A> , some
students are investigating problems in logic programming, including
abstract interpretation and visual unification.
