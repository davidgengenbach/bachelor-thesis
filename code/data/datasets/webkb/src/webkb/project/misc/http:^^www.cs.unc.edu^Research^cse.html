<STRONG> Description </STRONG>:

This research covers two closely related areas of
collaboration technology: collaborative tools and infrastructures.
In the area of
collaborative tools
it is addressing the
potential of these tools for making
<!WA4><A HREF = "ftp://ftp.cs.unc.edu/pub/users/dewan/papers/cse.ps.Z">
distributed collaborative software engineering tasks
</A>
more concurrent, thereby allowing these
time-consuming tasks to be completed significantly more quickly.
In the area of
<!WA5><A HREF = "ftp://ftp.cs.unc.edu/pub/users/dewan/papers/trends.ps.Z">
collaborative infrastructures,
</A>
it is addressing
support for near-automatic generation of efficient, collaborative tools,
thereby significantly reducing the tremendous amount of effort 
required to program these tools manually. These two efforts are
related since the infrastructure is being used to build the tools
and the tools are being used to evaluate the infrastructure.
Some of the specific issues being addressed include
<!WA6><A HREF = "ftp://ftp.cs.unc.edu/pub/users/dewan/papers/access-control.ps.Z">
security
</A>,
<!WA7><A  HREF = "ftp://ftp.cs.unc.edu/pub/users/dewan/papers/cc.ps.Z">
consistency

<!WA8><A  HREF = "ftp://ftp.cs.unc.edu/pub/users/dewan/papers/undo.ps.Z">
undo
</A>,
computer support for gathering software
engineering requirements, and asynchronous software engineering
meetings. The research is using an experimental method wherein
the infrastructure and tools are being implemented and used
in case studies. The research results include
taxonomies of collaboration scenarios;
