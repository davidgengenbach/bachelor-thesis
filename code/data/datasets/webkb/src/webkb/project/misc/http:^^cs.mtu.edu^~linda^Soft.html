<H3>Description:</H3>

<P>
The focus of the research on software measurement has been on
identifying and measuring non-trivial characteristics related to
software quality.  Much of this work has focused on measuring cohesion
in the procedural paradigm.  Recently we have shifted our focus to 
include the object-oriented paradigm.
