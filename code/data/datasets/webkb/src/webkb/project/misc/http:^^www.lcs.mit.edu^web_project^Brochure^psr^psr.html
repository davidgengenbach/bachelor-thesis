<BODY>
<p>

The Programming Systems Research Group is exploring
methodologies to facilitate the discovery and use of
information.  Our current projects include an intelligent
query access system that implements resource discovery on
the Internet (NII); digital video storage, composition, and
presentation; mobile access to Internet resources; caching
architectures for information; and personal information
discovery agents.  These projects are presently based on
extensions to Semantic File Systems, Mosaic/WWW servers,
WAIS servers, and object repositories.
<p>
Each of our projects is designed to test a new concept.
Examples of concepts we are currently examining include <!WA3><A

routing</a>, <!WA4><A
HREF="http://www.psrg.lcs.mit.edu/Projects/AVS/intro.html">algebraic
video</a>, and the creative use highly asymmetic bandwidth. <p>
Our approach to research is to use formal tools,
implementation, and experimentation to help us understand
the strenghts and limitations of a given system.  The end
goals of a project are to publish new algorithms and
experimental findings, to create a complete system that can
be released for use by people outside of MIT, and to have
fun (of course).
