The Universities Space Automation/Robotics Consortium (USARC) is a unique
infrastructure for distributed robotics, remote operations, and
distributed simulation research.  Using a object-oriented protocol
and the Internet, this distributed laboratory consists of sites at five
universities (

<!WA5><a href="http://riceinfo.rice.edu">Rice University</a>) and 
<!WA6><a href="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/jsc/home.html">NASA's Johnson
Space Center</a>.  The distributed laboratory configuration provides the
opportunity to quantitatively study the effects of various system
components and technologies on overall telerobotic task performance.

We
have successfully implemented and demonstrated (first in Feb. 1991) the
ability to execute representative inspection and manipulation tasks
with multiple control, robot, and performance/workload monitoring
sites simultaneously connected.  Operations are carried out on a routine
basis.  During the process, needs for hardware and software standards
development have been identified.  The current implementation provides the
basis to link government, industrial, and university facilities to realize
a truly collaborative research, development, and educational environment.
