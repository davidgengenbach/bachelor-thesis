<H1>The TRAINS Project:</H1>
<H2>Natural Spoken Dialogue and Interactive Planning</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
The TRAINS project at the University of Rochester Department of
Computer Science is a long-term effort to develop an intelligent
planning assistant that is conversationally proficient in natural
language. The goal is a fully integrated system involving online
spoken and typed natural language together with graphical displays and
GUI-based interaction. The primary application has been a planning
and scheduling domain involving a railroad freight system, where the
human manager and the system must cooperate to develop and execute
plans.
<P>
Research in the TRAINS project has been along two tracks. First, the
project has supported Ph.D. thesis research in natural language
processing, speech interpretation, discourse processing, planning, and
reasoning under uncertainty. Complete references are available from
the resources given below. Second, over the course of the project we
have periodically pulled the research threads together and produced
limited but working demonstration systems based on the theories. The
hope is that this incremental development is converging towards the
ultimate goal of a fully conversant system. Details of these systems
are also available from many of the references given below, and in
particular in the <!WA1><A HREF="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/research/trains/tn94-3/"><EM>JETAI</EM> paper</A>.
<P>
Current research in the TRAINS project centers on an interactive
route-planning assistant dubbed ``TRAINS-96.'' Details are available
in a <!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/research/trains/trains95/">paper</A> presented at the ARPA Spoken
Language Technology workshop, and in a <!WA3><A HREF="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/research/trains/aips96/">paper</A> to
appear in AIPS-96. Work in progress involves a more realistic domain
and more complicated planning problems.  We (still) hope to have a
version of the TRAINS system running over the WWW in the near future.
