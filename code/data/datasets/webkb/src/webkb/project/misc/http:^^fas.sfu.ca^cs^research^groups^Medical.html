<H1>SFU Medical Computing Group</H1>

We do research into the applications of 3D analysis and display
techniques for medical images, especially those from functional
imaging modalities such as Poiston Emission Tomography (PET).<P>

We collaborate with MDs, Scientists and Engineers at several
Vancouver Health Units to apply our analysis and display techniques
in a clinical setting, including the study of cancer therapy planning
using CT, MRI and PET images. <P>

We also perform foundational research on visual programming tools,
and the parallelisation of compute-intensive code to speed up the
results.<P>
