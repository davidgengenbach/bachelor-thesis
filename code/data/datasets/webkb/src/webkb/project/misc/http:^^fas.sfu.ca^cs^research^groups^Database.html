<H1>SFU Database Systems Group</H1>

Research in the area of database systems ranges from relational
databases to distributed, intelligent, and heterogeneous data- and
knowledge-bases, and their applications. Faculty interests include the
design and implementation of extended-relational, object-oriented and
deductive database systems, query processing and query optimization,
concurrency control, recovery, and transaction management in
traditional distributed databases and heterogeneous multi-databases,
fault-tolerant distributed databases, spatial databases, knowledge
discovery in databases, multimedia databases, natural language
interfaces to database systems, and database applications in
engineering and geographic information systems.
