<h2>Nature of Work</h2>

The Mach Shared Objects project is an effort to apply object-oriented
techniques to the problems of operating systems interface and
implementation, language implementations, and storage techniques.
These areas are covered by a variety of software components and
theoretical groundwork which operate in concert to enhance existing
technonogies.

	 "http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mecklen/omos/iwooos.html">OMOS -
	 An Object/Meta-Object Server</a>

    <dd> OMOS is an active object server which manages executable
	 programs and their components as a set of composable objects.
	 Besides replacing the traditional services of a linker, OMOS
	 is able to provide dynamic object loading, shared libraries,
	 program analysis, and custom application construction.<p>

    <dt> The Object Manager

    <dd> The object manager provides a centralized service for
	 storing, retrieving, and naming object instances and the
	 meta-objects.  This provides the services commonly attributed
	 to a persistent object data manager.<p>

    <dt> <!WA6><a href = "http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/mso/goofie/goofie.html">A General Object-Oriented
	 Framework for Interface Expression</a>

    <dd> GOOFIE is a meta-object generator capable of creating
	 portable object descriptions.  These meta-objects are used to
	 store and retrieve objects, marshal and unmarshal arguments
	 to function calls and provide a ``platform'' for univeral
	 polymorphism in the C++ programming language.<p>
