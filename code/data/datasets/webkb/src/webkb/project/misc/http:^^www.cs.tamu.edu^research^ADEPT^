<H2>Ada 95 Distributed Execution and Partitioning Toolset</H2>
</CENTER>

The <!WA1><A HREF="http://www.cs.tamu.edu/research/ADEPT/project_team.html">ADEPT project team</A> has implemented
a set of tools for configuring and building distributed Ada
programs.  These tools are consistent with the Ada 95
<!WA2><A HREF="#annex_e">Distributed Systems Annex</A>, and
have been designed for use with the
NYU GNU Ada 95 compiler (<!WA3><A HREF="http://www.gnat.com">GNAT</A>). 
The ADEPT project is funded by Computer Sciences Corporation.
<p>
ADEPT includes a graphical tool for partitioning and configuring 
Ada 95 distributed programs (the PCT), which runs on Sun Sparcs running 
the Solaris 2.4 and 2.5 operating systems. It also includes a Partition
Communication System (PCS), originally developed by France Telecom and
modified by Texas A&M, designed to support multiple protocols,
including TCP/IP.  Untested sources for a Windows NT version of the PCS
are also available.  
<p>
A demonstration of ADEPT was conducted at the CSC Solutions Business 
Conference in Dallas Tx, on July 19, 1996.  The demonstration
featured two examples of distributed Ada programs executing across a network of
Sun SPARC workstations: the familiar Mandelbrot image generator,
and a simple prototype of the AEGIS Weapons System geometric server. 
Because of the increasing 
interest in the use of Java, the distributed Ada programs were connected to a 
Java application that performed all the graphical display tasks. This is 
believed to be the first demonstration of a distributed application comprising
Ada and Java components.
<p>
The future direction of ADEPT  (renamed Advanced Distributed Engineering and 
Programming Toolset) is to provide Ada/Java interoperability by allowing Java 
clients to access Ada servers using their respective distributed object models.
This means that a Java client may use the Java Remote Method Invocation to call
distributed/remote objects that have been created using Annex E in an Ada 
server. The use of Ada and Java in these roles may provide the basis for 
solving many of the distributed application problems of the future.
