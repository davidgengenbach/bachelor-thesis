<h2>Summary</h2><p>

The Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt (CTGV) is
developing the Jasper Woodbury Problem Solving Series, a 
videodisc based program
designed to motivate students and help them learn to think and
reason mathematically about complex realistic problems.
As part of this project, we are developing a collection of
computer-based
learning environments that incorporate the project's
constructivist theories, generative learning techniques, and
anchoring macrocontexts into an <b>Intelligent Learning 
Environment</b> design.
The resulting paradigm <em>Macrocontexts Plus Microworlds</em>
(MPMs), where microworld exploration and problem solving is 
anchored within an interesting macrocontext.  </p>

<p>
Two systems we have constructed and tested are:
<ol>

<li> AdventurePlayer, a 
trip planning microworld that can be anchored to a Jasper
macrocontext.  
This system allows students to construct, evaluate, and reason
about 
solutions to trip planning problems, and 

<li> SmartTools, also linked
to a trip planning microworld, where students study and develop
graphical
tools to quickly answer various questions about distance, time,
rate and
gas consumption. This system has also been used as a test bed
for
studying the richness of computer traces for protocol analysis.
</ol>

<p>
Both systems incorporate beneficial aspects of both
intelligent tutoring systems and cognitive tools through
reflective interaction, scaffolding, and coaching.  </p>

<p>
Current work in this area is focusing on an ONR-sponsored
project for
studying student understanding of AC-circuit concepts.  The goal
is to develop appropriate instructional methodologies and
computer-based
environments for training technicians in complex maintenance and
troubleshooting tasks. </p>
