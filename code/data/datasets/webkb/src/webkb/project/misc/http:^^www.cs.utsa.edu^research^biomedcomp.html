<H1>Biomedical Computing Laboratory</H1>

The Biomedical Computing laboratory investigates
fundamental issues in biomedical computing.
The laboratory provides a multidisciplinary environment
for biomedical computing research. 
The laboraty supports a number of research project
involving biomedical research using computers.
Professor 
<!WA0><A NAME=me HREF="http://www.cs.utsa.edu/faculty/rosen.html">
Bruce Rosen </A>
is director of the laboratory.
The laboratory is interested in developing algorithms
to detect salient clinical features from biological signals
and to aid physicians in medical decision making.
