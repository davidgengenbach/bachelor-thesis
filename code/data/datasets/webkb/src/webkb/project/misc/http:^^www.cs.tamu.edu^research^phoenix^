<P>The Phoenix project is being carried out at the Distributed Systems Laboratories, at Texas A&M University, Computer Science Department.<P>

Phoenix is an object oriented environment, which will provide fault tolerance 
capabilities to objects.  Phoenix uses, 
<!WA6><A HREF="http://www.sun.com:80/cgi-bin/show?tech/projects/spring/index.body/"> 
Spring Research Distribution </A> from <!WA7><A HREF="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</A>, 
which is a object oriented distributed operating system, as its base.  
The aim of Phoenix is to provide fault tolerance to objects in Spring.<P>

The fault tolerance in Phoenix is provided at two levels:
<OL>
<LI>Totally user (application) tranparent: At this level the system provides 
fault tolerance for any (object oriented) application that is developed in Spring.  Fault tolerance is provided without the modification of the source code.  Thus fault tolerance can be provided for a third party object, whose source code is not available.<P>

<LI>Fault Tolerance API: At this level, users specifically develop the
application to tolerate faults using the library functions provided by Phoenix 
(application programmers interface - APIs).  This is not totally user 
transparent, but will have a better performance than the totally user 
transparent one.
</OL>

<B>Phoenix Components:</B><P>


The major components (inter dependent) of the Phoenix system are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Fault Tolerance support for distributed Objects (provided by FTO Layer): FTO
layer makes the objects in Phoenix fault tolerant, using checkpointing and
message logging and object replication.  It does so, with minimal disturbance 
in the object response time.  It uses the support provided by FTNS and FTC.

<LI>Fault Tolerant Naming Service (provided by FTNS layer): This service helps 
in finding replicated objects, objects that are moved/restarted because of 
failures.  This is done transparent to the user.
 
<LI>Fault Tolerant Communication services (provided by FTC Layer): This layer
provides reliable causally/totally ordered communication support for objects.  It also assists FTO in
checkpointing and message logging.

<LI> Distributed system health checker (distributed failure detection service):
This module continuously checks the health of the system in a distributed
fashion.  It informs Phoenix of the faults in the system.  This layer also
helps in continuing execution of a failed object/node.
