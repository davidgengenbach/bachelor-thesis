<H2> Logical Reasoning with Diagrams </H2>



<Strong>Description: </Strong> 
<Blockquote>
Engineers have long used diagrams as an essential part of the design
process.  Flow charts and other forms of diagrams are well known aides
in programming.  There are now programming environments where the
programming is entirely diagrammatic.
The graphic capabilities of the computer have led to the wide spread
use of diagrammatic and other forms of graphical representation of
information.  This project attempts to understand the logical
properties of such forms of representation, and to develop
computational tools to facilitate the correct use of such tools.
