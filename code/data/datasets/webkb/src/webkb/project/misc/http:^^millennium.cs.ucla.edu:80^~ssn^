<H2>OBJECTIVE:</H2>

The major focus of this research is the design, testing and prototyping
of a novel, high-performance, optical interconnection network for
supercomputers, which is based on optically communicating mesh routers
or crossbars, and which is scalable. The geographic coverage ranges
from interdepartmental to campus and even to metropolitan areas. The
network provides very high speed multiple services, supporting hybrid
circuit-switched and datagram traffic, and direct or multi-hop
connections that are dynamically reconfigurable. At a first networking
level, we locally interconnect workstations, supercomputers, peripheral
devices, mass memory etc. through host interfaces. At a higher
networking level, we use fully optical interconnects, allowing
communication between devices connected to distinct mesh routers. A
goal of this research is to capture the large, latent, distributed
computational power of the network processors, to be used for network
control and management, leading to an intelligent network.  A main
motivation for the research stems from the limitations observed in
current supercomputer interconnect systems, and from the opportunities
offered by emerging communication technologies such as WDM
optoelectronics for novel, feasible system architectures.

<H2>APPROACH:</H2>

We propose to overcome the usual interconnect problems by replacing the
point-to-point links with an all-optical interconnect system. Namely,
the high speed LANS will be connected to an optical star (or tree)
"physical" topology. Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) will be
used to subdivide the very large fiber bandwidth into several channels,
each of Gbps bandwidth. WDM channels (supporting also time division
multiplexing) will be established between modules, thus defining a
dense "virtual" interconnection topology, which is dynamically
reconfigurable, responding to changing traffic patterns.  A pool of
channels will be set aside for direct, end-to-end connections between
mesh routers, providing circuit-switched service for real-time traffic
applications.<P>


The heart of the Distributed Supercomputer Supernet is OPTIMIC -
OPTical Interconnect of MyriNet IC chips. OPTIMIC is a novel,
high-performance network consisting of Myricom asynchronous pipeline
crossbars (APC) interconnected by a WDM optical backbone. It supports
both circuit-switched and packet switched (datagram) traffic; it
achieves virtual topology reconfigurable interconnection through an
optical star (or tree), and, it bases its networking operations on the
intelligent fabric of the network itself. In OPTIMIC, each network node
(i.e. APC) is connected to local hosts, to other nodes, and to multiple
optical channels via an Optical Channel Interface (OCI).

The optical interconnection and the use of their intelligence
(computational power) for network operation and control, will be
supported by several technical innovations at various levels of network
design, including system integration and implementation, interfacing,
distributed algorithms and protocols, modeling and performance
evaluation, intelligent control and resource allocation etc.

<H2>TECHNOLOGY TRANSITION:</H2>

Among the technology transfer possibilities for the research, we list the 
following.

Fine Grain Meta-Supercomputer: The SSN attributes would accelerate the 
evolution of a network-based operating system with precise synchronization 
of dispersed processes, fine grain process management on 100's-1000's of 
processor elements, distributed checkpointing of jobs, and dynamic entry of 
new hosts.<P>

Real Time Distributed Network Operating System: Low and predictable
(bounded) latency makes ideal for wide area network control and data
acquisition applications. Examples in the government include Air Force
SATCOM network, SDIBE, remote robot control for NASA applications, and
in the commercial arena, oil refinery and power plant control, avionics
and spacecraft control systems, control of electrical power
distribution systems, and factory automation.<P>

Distributed Image Data Base Perusal: Scientific image-based data-base
archival and perusal systems are now being developed in several
efforts, such as the UC Sequoia effort and the MAGIC testbed. NASA
applications, such as EOS will require the capability of perusing
through terabytes of data very quickly and interactively. A low latency
high throughput network will be essential for responding quickly to
interactive control from the user (datagram) and sending image bursts
back to the user (streams/circuit switched).
