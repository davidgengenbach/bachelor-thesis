<h3>Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>

   Traditional multicast  routing  mechanisms  (e.g.  DVMRP  and
   MOSPF)  were intended for use within regions where groups are
   widely represented or bandwidth is universally plentiful. 
<p>When  group
   members, and senders to those group members, are distributed
   sparsely across a wide area, these schemes are not  efficient;  data
   packets  or  membership report information are periodically sent over
   many links that do  not lead to receivers or  senders,  respectively.
   This  characteristic  lead  the  Internet  community  to  investigate
   multicast   routing   architectures   that   efficiently    establish
   distribution  trees across wide-area internets, where many groups are
   sparsely represented and where bandwidth is not  uniformly  plentiful
   due   to   the  distances  and  multiple  administrations  traversed.
   Efficiency is evaluated  in  terms  of  the  state,  control  message
   processing,  and  data  packet  processing required across the entire
   network in order to deliver data packets to the members of the group.
<p>
   The   Protocol   Independent    Multicast--Sparse    Mode    (PIM-SM)
   architecture:
<menu>
<li> maintains the traditional IP multicast  service  model  of
             receiver-initiated membership;
<li>  uses  explicit  joins  that  propagate  hop-by-hop   from
             members' directly connected routers toward the distribution
             tree.
<li> builds a shared multicast distribution tree centered at  a
             Rendezvous Point, and then builds source-specific trees for
             those sources whose data traffic warrants it.
<li>  is not dependent on a specific unicast  routing  protocol;
             and
<li> uses soft-state mechanisms to adapt to underlying  network
             conditions and group dynamics.
</menu>

        The robustness, flexibility,  and  scaling  properties  of  this
        architecture  make  it well suited to large heterogeneous inter-
        networks.
