Introduction and Goals:<br>
<p>        The purpose of this three-year reseach project (1994-1996) is to
develop a framework and systematic methodology to facilitate the
application of Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) to a diverse
class of system design problems. MDO is based upon the philosophy of
identifying the appropriate combination of parameters which are under the
control of a designer (or design team) and which will result in the most
effective product or system. For all practical aerospace systems, the
design of a systems is a complex sequence of events which integrates the
activities of a variety of discipline "experts" and their associated
"tools". The development, archiving and exchange of information between
these individual experts is central to the design task.  It is this
information which provides the basis for these experts to make their design
decisions - resulting in the final product. 
<p>        The development of MDO has been inextricably tied to developments
in computer hardware and software. Advanced analysis tools such as
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA) have
now been integrated into the daily activities of many designers. However,
design decisions are often based on a variety of information sources,
analytic, numerical simulation, design heuristic or even "intuition". The
development and integration of this information using "high powered
computing" tools has begun to demonstrate the true potential of MDO.
<p>        A variety of methods and applications are being considered. In each
case the fundamental approach is to provide the individual discipline
expert with the information necessary to evaluate the system as a whole and
to be able to understand the impact of individual decisions on the overall
system design. The methods being considered include extensions to Global
Sensitivity Equations (GSE), the application of artificial neural networks
for design space mapping and the integration of distributed computing and
process scheduling into the MDO environment.
<p>       The current research effort is a joint program between the Departments of  
<!WA10><a href="http://www.nd.edu/Departments/EN/AME/HomePage.html">Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering</a>

and the
 
<!WA11><a href="http://www.cse.nd.edu">Computer Science and Engineering</a> 

Departments at the University of Notre Dame. The coordination of efforts within the project is based upon identification of
a series of 

<!WA12><a href="http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ndmdo/demo_problems.html">Demonstration Problems</a>
, the formulation of a number of 

<!WA13><a href="http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ndmdo/MDO_algorithms.html">MDO Algorithms</a>

and specific 

<!WA14><a href="http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ndmdo/Design_Tool_Development.html">Design Tool Development</a>. 

Test problem and algorithm development provide a focus for the efforts of each of these individual
researchers. These problems are being selected so that they represent a
diverse spectrum of MDO applications and will present a variety of
challenges for the methods being developed and evaluated as part of this
research program. As this three year program continues, information related
to each of the primary phases of the project will be added to this
document. The results of those issues identified as 

<!WA15><a href="http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ndmdo/Future_Efforts.html">Future Efforts</a>

 will be used to assess applicability of the 

<!WA16><a href="http://www.cse.nd.edu/~ndmdo/MDO_tools.html">MDO tools</a>
 
 to a wide variety of applications. A number of references are available which outline various developments associated with this research program.
