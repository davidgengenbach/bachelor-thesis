<h1> The <i>SPIN</i> Operating System</h1>

<p>
<i>SPIN</i> is an extensible operating system kernel that
supports the dynamic adaptation of system interfaces and
implementations through direct application control, while still
maintaining system integrity and inter-application isolation.
<p>
<i>SPIN</i> allows applications to load code into the kernel at
runtime. Because it runs in the kernel, this extension code can access
hardware and other operating systems services with with almost no
overhead (basically a procedure call), and data can be passed by
reference, rather than copied.  The <i>SPIN</i> kernel itself provides
a core set of interfaces and capabilities to basic resources.  These
are used by collections of extensions to implement general system
services such as address spaces, IPC, threads, and networking.  All
extension code (and most of the kernel) is written in the typesafe language <!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><A
HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/external/modula3/index.html">Modula-3</A>. The property of
typesafety prevents extensions from crashing the system by attempting
to manipulate arbitrary pieces of code or data. 
<p>
<i>SPIN</i> runs on DEC Alpha workstations. We're using it to write
both specialized applications such as network video systems, as well
as for supporting general purpose UNIX programs.

<p>
You can connect to a machine
running SPIN with the in-kernel SPIN web server

<h2> Quick Results </h2>
<ul>
This structure allows programs to extend operating system services with
low overhead. For example, with <i>SPIN</i> running on a 133 MHz Alpha,
an application can handle and recover from a page fault in 29 microseconds.
It takes 22 microseconds to create a new thread of control, execute
it, terminate, and synchronize with its termination (fork/join).  A protected
procedure call to another extension or to a kernel function takes .13
microseconds. A cross-machine RPC (application to application) over
ethernet takes under 600 microseconds; over ATM (on really old
adapters) it takes less than 450 microseconds. The same  operations
under Mach or DEC UNIX take up to 30 times longer on the same
hardware.  Time them yourself (or see our <!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><a

yourself the effort).
