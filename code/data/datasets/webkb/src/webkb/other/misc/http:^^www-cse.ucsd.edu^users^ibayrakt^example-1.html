<TITLE>Fill-Out Form Example #1</TITLE>
<H1>Fill-Out Form Example #1</H1>

This is a very simple fill-out form example. <P>

<!WA0><FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/ibayrakt/cgi-bin/post-query">

A single text entry field goes here: <INPUT NAME="entry"> <P>

Note that it has no default value. <P>

To submit the query, press this button: <INPUT TYPE="submit"
VALUE="Submit Query">. <P>

</FORM>

That's it. <P>

Things you may want to note: <P>

<UL>
<LI> Characters like "&amp;", "%", and "$" in the text typed into the
     text entry field are automatically escaped (into hex form: a
     percent sign followed by a two-digit hex value corresponding to
     the ASCII value of the character) when the query is constructed.
     For example, the string "&amp;%$" becomes "%26%25%24".
<LI> By default, an <CODE>INPUT</CODE> tag corresponds to a text entry
     field.  The <CODE>TYPE</CODE> attribute lets you change this --
     the "submit" type indicates a special pushbutton that causes the
     query to be submitted when it's pushed.  Other types are
     demonstrated in the other examples.
<LI> Because this fill-out form contains only a single text entry
     field, the query can be submitted by pressing return in the text
     entry field (as well as by pressing the "Submit Query" button).
</UL>
