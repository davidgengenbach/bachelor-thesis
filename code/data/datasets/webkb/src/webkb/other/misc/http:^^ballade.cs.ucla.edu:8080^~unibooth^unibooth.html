<h2> What IS the Unibooth? </h2>
The Unibooth is where University researchers will be providing demonstrations
of their CAD algorithms.  It will be on the exhibition floor, along with
all the industry exhibitors.
<p>
Although we won't be giving away very many T-shirts, coffee mugs, or
trips to the Bahamas, it's definately worth a visit.
<p>
<h3>
<ul>
<li> If you're visiting, you can check out some of the
<!WA7><a href="http://ballade.cs.ucla.edu:8080/~unibooth/demo.html"> demos</a>, and we
won't even charge you the admissions fee!  You can also get
the <!WA8><a href="http://ballade.cs.ucla.edu:8080/~unibooth/flyer.ps"> advertising flyer </a> that will be in
the DAC tote bags, or possibly the <!WA9><a href="http://ballade.cs.ucla.edu:8080/~unibooth/flyer2.ps"> new advertising
flyer</a> which has a summary of the demo schedule.  A 
<!WA10><a href="http://ballade.cs.ucla.edu:8080/~unibooth/assign_time.html"> schedule of demo times </a> is also available.
The <!WA11><a href="http://ballade.cs.ucla.edu:8080/~unibooth/flat_table.html"> tabular schedule </a> is here.
