<h2>
An overview of the HERMES Project
</h2>

HERMES is a system for semantically integrating different and possibly 
heterogeneous
information sources and reasoning systems. This is accomplished
by executing programs, called <em> mediators</em>,
written in the HERMES system.
Mediators, first proposed by Wiederhold, are guidelines of how 
information from different sources will be combined and integrated.
HERMES system is based on the theory of Hybrid Knowledge Bases, due
to Lu, Nerode and Subrahmanian. In this framework, external information
sources are abstracted as domains which execute certain functions
with pre-specified input and output type. These domains are
accessed in mediators using a logic-based declarative language.
This language is based on Annotated Logics, due to Kifer and
Subrahmanian, and it provides a powerfull and extensible programming
environment. The system also provides a uniform environment for
the easy addition of new external sources to existing mediators.
The system currently runs on
Sun Sparc stations (under Unix), as well as on the IBM-PC platform
under DOS/Windows 3.1. A graphical user interface has been built on
both platforms.
