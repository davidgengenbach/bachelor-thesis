This hypertext Webster interface provides a point-and-click client interface
(for non-linemode browsers)
for accessing the various Webster's dictionary services on the Internet.
First, <em>type</em> the word for which you want the definition
in the search window and hit return.
Words in the resulting definition are hypertext linked
back into the dictionary, allowing you to use your mouse
to access the definition of those related (and unrelated) words.
<p>

If you misspell the word, the webster server may offer a list of close
matches as alternatives.  If you know the prefix of the word, a list
of potential matches may be obtained by entering a <samp>*</samp> after
the prefix, e.g., <samp><!WA1><a href="http://work.ucsd.edu:5141/cgi-bin/http_webster?alpha*">alpha*</a></samp>.
<p>

This Web interface is rather simple-minded -- all but very short words
are hyperlinked back to the dictionary.
Because it doesn't know if the words are actually in the dictionary,
these links may fail.  In particular, prefix/suffix removal to find the root
word is neither performed by the Web interface nor the Webster server,
so the link for
<!WA2><a href="http://work.ucsd.edu:5141/cgi-bin/http_webster?alphabetically">alphabetically</a>
doesn't work,
since the webster server only has an entry for
<!WA3><a href="http://work.ucsd.edu:5141/cgi-bin/http_webster?alphabetic">alphabetic</a>,
and it is not smart enough to find the root.
<em>The job of root extraction should be done in the Webster server,
just as spell correction feedback is done now for
<!WA4><a href="http://work.ucsd.edu:5141/cgi-bin/http_webster?alphebetic">alphebetic</a></em>.
Note that you can use cut-and-paste to extract the root and paste it into the
search window: you just have to click-hold-drag instead of single-click.
<p>

The webster client program used internally by this interface is
<samp>/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/bsy/bin/webster</samp>,
if you want to use it from outside of the WWW.
The webster database server that it contacts is configurable via
your <samp>~/.webster</samp> file; see the
<!WA5><a href="http://work.ucsd.edu:5141/cgi-bin/http_man?webster">man page</a>
for details.
The webster client currently uses
<samp>2627@citi.umich.edu</samp> as
its webster server.
<p>

The webster client used to use one of several webster servers,
depending on which responds first.
Unfortunately, all other webster servers have been shut down.
If you know of any webster protocol servers that may be used,
please let me know.
<p>

Other dictionaries on the Web include the
<!WA6><a href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/forms_unrest/webster.form.html">ARTFL</a> project's dictionary,
and <!WA7><a href="http://www.m-w.com/">Merriam-Webster's</a> dictionary.
