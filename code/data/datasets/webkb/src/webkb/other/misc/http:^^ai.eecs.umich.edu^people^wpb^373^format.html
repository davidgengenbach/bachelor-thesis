<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>ABOUT EECS 373 LAB REPORTS</FONT></B></CENTER>

<P>

Lab reports are due 1 week after your section completes the lab,

(i.e., at your next lab session.) at the beginning of the lab.

You need to demonstrate your working program to a TA before the

beginning of your next lab section. 

<P>

Here is what we expect to see on your reports.

<P>

1. <U>Purpose/Procedure</U>: A brief description of the purpose

of the lab and a summary of steps followed.

<P>

2. <U>Hardware:</U> For each new components, such as new chip

or a new part of the 80186 (such as timer, interrupt controller

or chip select unit).

<UL>

<LI>What does the component do? Why do you use it?

<LI>How is the chip connected to the microprocessor?

<LI>How do you write to or read from the component? If the component

has internal registers, how do you access them?

<LI>How do you generate (a) chip select(s) for the chip? 

</UL>



<P>

3. <U>Software: </U>Through description of the software, including:

<UL>

<LI>A complete explanation of the new parts of your software.

which should be documented with either a flowchart or a high-level

programming language.

<LI>If you write anything to the peripheral chips, an explanation

of where (which address) and why you wrote it. 

<LI>If you use any specific numbers, (e.g., address of the register

in a chip,the numbers you used for the clock generators in Lab

3, etc.) show a derivation of how you find them. (Please do not

use such numbers in your code segment; equate the to variables

at the beginning of the program and use variable names in the

code segment.) 

</UL>



<P>

4. Memory and I/O map: Draw both memory and I/O space.

<UL>

<LI>Show locations of all code and data segments.

<LI>Show all peripheral registers.

<LI>Show all the components that you use. 

<LI>Any other addresses that seem significant. 

</UL>



<P>

5. Answer to questions in the lab manual.

<P>

6. A signed copy of your working program: A TA will sign it when

you demonstrate your working program to him or her.
