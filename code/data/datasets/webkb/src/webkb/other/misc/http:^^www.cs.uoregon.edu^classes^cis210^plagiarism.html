<h2>Policy on Plagiarism </h2>

<hr>

Lab exercises, homework, etc., must be the
original work of each individual student. 
In general, you will not be working in
 programming teams this term.

<p>

When you turn in a paper with your name on it, you are stating that
it is <i> your  work </i> exclusively.

<p> Working with a partner is not an option unless otherwise
specified on an assignment. Therefore, if you work too closely with
someone else, and each of you turn in identical papers,<b> you will be
crossing the line into plagiarism </b> (i.e., turning in another's work
under your own name).

<p>
Signing your name to another's work constitutes plagiarism
(i.e., academic dishonesty) and is a serious violation of the rules of
fair play, and the <b>consequences can be both severe and permanent.</b>
Please refer to the Student Conduct Code in the Schedule of
Classes and Student Handbook for further information.

<p> General discussion of assignments with other students, however,
 is a good idea and is encouraged.<p>

<p>
<i>If this sounds complicated and you are ever in doubt about
plagiarism, please consult your instructor in advance. </i>
<P>
