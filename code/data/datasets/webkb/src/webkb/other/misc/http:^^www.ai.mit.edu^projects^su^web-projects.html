    Suppose World-Wide Web servers had Scheme interpreters linked in
    with their executables. Then small Scheme programs could transfer
    themselves across the network from server to server to carry out tasks for
    their masters, perhaps coming back to a home machine to report on their
    results in the end. Scheme is a good choice for such a language because
    Scheme implementations are "safe" -- it is easy to guarantee that an
    arbitrary Scheme program received by a server can't damage the server or
    compromise its security. With proper cryptographic authentication, an
    agent can access or commit the user's resources: buy movie tickets, check
    his bank account, and so forth.

<LI> <H2>TeXinfo->html converter</H2>

    TeXinfo is a hypertext markup language for writing documentation
    used by the Gnu project. Many of the Gnu project's tools, such
    as Gnu emacs, gawk, bison, and gcc, are documented using the TeXinfo
    system. Documents written in TeXinfo can be either converted into
    on-line hypertext documentation, or converted into TeX and then
    typeset into paper manuals.
 <P>
    HTML is the the hypertext markup language for the World-Wide Web.
    A text processor that converts documents from TeXinfo to HTML would
    allow authors to write a single document, in TeXinfo, and provide
    it in all three formats.
