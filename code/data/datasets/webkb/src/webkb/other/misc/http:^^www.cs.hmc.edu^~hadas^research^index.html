<p>
My research addresses the problem of fault-tolerance in
distributed memory parallel computers or <EM> multicomputers. </EM>  While 
multicomputers have a number of attractive features, one difficulty
in these systems is that of computing in the presence of faults.
This problem is particularly acute in massively parallel architectures
employing very large numbers of nodes.
<p>

The objective of this research is to develop practical algorithms
for fault-tolerant unicast and multicast 
routing in wormhole-routed multicomputers.  In addition, we seek
to obtain tight theoretical bounds on the number of faults that can
be tolerated with a given set of resources.
In particular, my students and I are developing efficient
fault-tolerant adaptive routing algorithms for the  mesh and torus
topologies.  Several <!WA0><A HREF = "http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~hadas/vitae/papers.html"> technical
reports and papers</A> describing recent results are available in postscript.
<p>

A number of Harvey Mudd students have taken an active role in 
this research project.  They are Eli Brandt ('95), Tom Hehre
('96), Kevin Watkins ('97), Andrew Hutchings ('98), and Mark Reyes ('98).
<p>

Tom Hehre and Kevin Watkins developed
the <b> Mesh Architecture Routing Simulator (MARS). </b>
MARS is an event-driven
simulation package for studying wormhole-routed meshes.
MARS is implemented in C++ and has an X-windows-based graphical
user interface that allows visualization of network traffic and
other network characteristics.  
MARS allows easy definition of router architectures, routing
algorithms, and selection policies.
Virtual channels are implemented
with demand-based multiplexing and the number of internal channels
and other router characteristics are user-definable.
A number of router and channel latency parameters are also
user-definable in order to facilitate fair comparisons between 
algorithms based on different routing models.
An example of the MARS interface is shown below.
