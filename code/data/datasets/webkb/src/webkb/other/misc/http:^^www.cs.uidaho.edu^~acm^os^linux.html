<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Linux is an extremely popular OS for i386 machines, with ports for m68k Macintosh
and Amiga machines, MIPS based machines, and DEC Alphas.
</p>

<p>
  One of the reasons that Linux is so popular is that its development
is completely open -- anyone can contribute.
</p>

<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>
  There are several linux distributions out there, both available on
CDROM and by FTP.  Linux <i>is</i> free, but their is a price for the
distributions.  This is to pay for the CDROM burning, as well as
tech support.
