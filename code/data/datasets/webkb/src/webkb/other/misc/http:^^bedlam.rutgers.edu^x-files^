If you liked those, perhaps you'll like our gallery of <!WA6><a href=http://bedlam.rutgers.edu/test/x-files/audio/>X-Files audio
snippets</a>, with much thanks to Patrick Ryan for the original

<li>The <!WA7><a href=http://bedlam.rutgers.edu/test/x-files/xfilesFAQ.html>Frequently Asked Questions</a> file, (aka <i>The <b>X-files</b> X-File</i>, maintained by Pat Gonzales (gonza006@maroon.tc.umn.edu.)
<li>The <!WA8><a href=http://bird.taponline.com/~cliff/><b>X-Files</b> episode Guide</a>, maintained by Cliff K. Chen (cliff@eniac.seas.upenn.edu) is really quite excellent.<p>

<b>AT LAST!</b> Warner Brothers is set to release the <b>Mark Snow
X-Files Soundtrack</b>: <!WA9><a href=http://www.wbr.com/marksnow>"The
Truth and The Light"</a> on October 8, 1996.  Hurrah!!!  Although the
web page doesn't include sound-bites (like "Key of X's" does), it does
include an nice bit of biography about Mr. Snow, track information
about the disk itself, and the hugest list of X-Files web sites I've
ever seen. <p>


<li>This way to Warner Brother's sample-filled(!) page for their
release (March 26, 1996) of the <!WA10><a href=http://www.wbr.com/x-files><b>Songs in the Key of X</b></a>.
As you have probably heard, this disc will have Mark Snow's Theme
song, and then the rest will be non-X-soundtrack music done by various
artists, who were inspired by the show (ok, so Nick Cave's "Red Right
Hand" is in there too.) That cover gives me the willies!  Audio samples
of excellent quality.<p>

<li>Cliff also maintains the <!WA11><a href=http://bedlam.rutgers.edu/test/x-files/20-questions>X-Files 20 Questions</a>.  Read before posting to X-Files newsgroups!
