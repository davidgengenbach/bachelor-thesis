<H2>Abstract</H2>

Real-time coordination of visual information with high speed
manipulator control is studied in the specific context of
three-dimensional robotic catching.  All path-planning for the catch
occurs in real-time during the half-second that the targeted object is
airborne.  We use a trajectory-matching algorithm that combines an
observer with a varying-strength filter, an error estimator, and an
initial motion algorithm.  The results are demonstrated experimentally
using a real-time vision system and a four-degree-of-freedom,
cable-driven arm with a workspace of 4.2 cubic meters and speed
capabilities of up to 2.0 m/s.
