<H2>Name</H2>
 <P><CODE>submit</CODE> - electronic submission of homework files
<H2>Synopsis</H2>
 <P><B>~cs4118/bin/submit</B> -h
 <P><B>~cs4118/bin/submit</B> [-a assignment_number] [forced_files ...]
<H2>Description</H2>
<CODE>submit</CODE> looks for submittable files in the current working
directory and recursively searches thorugh all directories within that
directory, ignoring all binary and potential backup files.  Upon
confirmation from the user, <CODE>submit</CODE> copies, archives and
compresses files, and stores them privately in the class account (~cs4118).
Mail confirming the files submitted is sent to the user.      
 <P>If you resubmit an assignment, your old assignment is moved to a backup
location.  If you resubmit more than once, only your last two submissions
will be kept.  You will be asked whether you really want to resubmit your
assignment.
 <P>A number (1-9) can be used with the <CODE>-a</CODE> option to specify a
particular homework which is being submitted.
 <P><CODE>forced_files</CODE> are forced into submission even if they would
ordinarily be ignored.
 <P>Usually the user will not need to specify <CODE>forced_files</CODE> or
<CODE>assignment_number</CODE>.  The submit program will submit the current
due assignment if the <CODE>-a</CODE> is not specified.
<H2>Options</H2>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-h</B>
<DD> Help option.  Shows options for the program.  Does <B>NOT</B> perform
a submission. 
<DT> <B>-a</B>
<DD> Submit a certain assignment, other than the one currently due.
</DL>

<H2>Notes</H2>
 <P>It is generally a good idea to create a separate subdirectory for each
of your homeworks.  In these homework directories will be any makefiles,
READMEs, C sources files header files and sample executions.  To submit
these files just run <CODE>submit</CODE> from within the corresponding
homework directory.
<H2>Return Values</H2>
 <P>Upon successful submission, the user is notified, via email, of the
successfully submitted files.  Upon failure, the user is instructed to
notify the <CODE>submit</CODE> administrator of the error codes.  

<H2>Files</H2>
 <P>~cs4118/bin/submit
 <P>~cs4118/bin/.submit
 <P>~cs4118/public_html/submit.html
 <P>~cs4118/lib/submission.log.? 
<H2>Example</H2>

<H2>Warnings</H2>
 <P>Be sure to be on a machine on the <CODE>CUNIX</CODE> cluster.
 <P>Because of incredible loads on the <CODE>CUNIX</CODE> cluster close to
submission times, you should leave yourself ample (+30 minutes) time to submit
your assignments.  The running time of the program should be less than 1 minute
for normal-sized submissions.
 <P>Deadlines are enforced by the submission program, and timing is
enforced by the <CODE>CUNIX</CODE> cluster machines' clock.  Not by your
watch, or <CODE>cs</CODE> cluster machines.
 <P>All submissions are logged.
