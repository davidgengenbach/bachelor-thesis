<H2> CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS </H2>

<!WA0><IMG ALT="" SRC="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/hermes/images/jet.gif">


<h3>PLATFORMS:</h3>
	    
	    <ul>
            Hermes is currently supported on two platforms, the 
            Unix/X platform, and the PC/Windows platform.
	    </ul>

<h3>DISTRIBUTED IMPLEMENTATION:</h3>

            <ul>
            A client-server based implementation of HERMES currently
            accesses data at 9 sites worldwide across the Internet.
            Addition of a new site to the network may be accomplished
            very quickly (30 minutes).  The following information describes
            the geographic distribution of currently-participating sites.

	    <dl>
            <p><dt>USA:   
		<dd>  Univ. of Maryland <br>
                      Cornell University <br>
                      Brown University <br>
                      Bucknell University <br>
		      TEC - U.S. Army Topographic and Engineering Center
 
	    <p> <dt> Europe:   
		<dd>  Univ. of Calabria, Italy   <br>
                      Technische-Universitat Wien, Austria   <br>
                      University of Aachen, Germany

            <p><dt> Rest:   
		<dd>  Univ. of New South Wales, Australia

	    </dl>

	    <p>
            Additional sites are currently being added.

            </ul>

<h3>PACKAGES INTEGRATED:</h3>

	   <ul>
           <p>DBMSs:  INGRES, PARADOX, DBASE, ObjectStore

	   <dl>
	   <p><dt>AI systems:
	      <dd>Feature-based Face Recognition Package  <br>
                  Holistic Eigen-value based Face Recognition Package  <br>
                  US Army Free Terrain Route Planner  <br>

           <p><dt>Misc. Software:  
	       <dd> AVIS (Advanced Video Information System)  <br>
                    MACS (Media Abstraction Creation System)  <br>
                    text database (newswires)  <br>
                    spatial database (PR-quadtrees)  <br>
                    Unix (bc, calc, ls, grep, xmosaic, xedit, etc.)  <br>
                    Math (elementary math operations)  <br>
                    Simulated airline reservation system.
	  </dl>

	  <p>
          The time taken to integrate a new package is approximately 1-2
          weeks of a full-time programmer, but could vary depending upon the
          package being designed.  Help tools for this include a 
          DOMAIN INTEGRATION TOOLKIT that may be used to integrate software at
          the systems level.  This toolkit is still being constructed;
          a preliminary version is expected to be available sometime during
          May 1995.
