<TITLE> CPS 410 Late Point Policy </TITLE>
<H1> CPS 410 Laboratory Late Points Policy </H1>
<P>
All programming assignments will have a due date specified.
After the due date, late assignment points will be reduced
by 20% per day.  Saturdays and Sundays are not included.  Thus,
after one week late, an assignment will be worth 0 points.
All assignments must be turned in and/or demonstrated in your 
next regularly scheduled lab after completion.
<P>
The "last change" date of a file will be used to determine
late points.  Consequently you should never examine a file 
with an editor after a due date.  Use either "more filename"
or make a copy of the file and examine only the copy.
<P>
You may check the dates of your files with 
<P>
                 <tt> checkdate   filename </tt>
<P>
which is available in the ~cps410 directory.
