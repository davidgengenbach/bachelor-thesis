<H1>My teaching activity</H1>

I teach classes in <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> and in
<em>Programming Languages</em>.<BR>
When I teach Artificial Intelligence, I am mostly interested in teaching
methods for <em>automated reasoning</em> and their logical foundations.<BR>
In Programming Languages, the emphasis is on <em>functional programming</em>,
<em>logic programming</em> and their foundations in lambda-calculus,
denotational semantics and automated deduction.<BR>
Since the computational mechanism in functional programming is a form
of equational reasoning and the computational mechanism in logic
programming is a form of deduction in Horn logic,
the common theme of the automation of deduction underlies both my
research and teaching activities.
