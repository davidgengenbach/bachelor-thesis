<H1>Rationale for Weekly Schedule

This is the rationale page for the <I>Weekly Schedule</I>
feature of the registration system.<P>

<B>Issue:</B> <I>Should the student's registration home page contain a weekly class
schedule?</i>
<h2>Summary</h2><p>

Scheduling issues are much more complicated for undergraduates than graduates.  Undergraduate
students are typically taking four or more classes, each of which may have several possible
sections.  It is important for them to see which classes conflict with which, and what their
final schedule would look like.  Graduate students take only two classes, and Ph.D. students
in their research phase may take none at all.  For graduate students, it is easy to
detect and avert scheduling conflicts.<p>

<HR><B>Design Decision:</B> The student's home page will show the
schedule for all the classes he or she has registered for.<p>

<B>How the Decision Meets the Needs</B>This design gives the undergraduate students
less than they asked for.  There is only one schedule, and that only shows classes
which the student is formally registered for.  There is no provision for the
student to bring up multiple potential schedules, or view the results of
possible registrations before committing to a given class.  While the
student is permitted to register for multiple classes in the same
time slot, only the first such class is displayed on the schedule (the student
will see the other class in the list of registered classes at the top of the
registration home page).<p>

This compromise was the best implementation we could do given the limitations of
Mosaic.
