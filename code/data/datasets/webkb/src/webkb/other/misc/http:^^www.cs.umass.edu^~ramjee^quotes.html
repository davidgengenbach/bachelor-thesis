<H1> Three Thought Provoking Quotes </H1>

<H2> Biochemist Szent-Gyorgyi on Scientific Thinking</H2>

Scientific thinking means that if we are faced with a problem, we
approach it without preconceived ideas and sentiments like fear, greed
and hatred. We approach it with a cool head and collect data which we
eventually try to fit together. This is all there is to it. It may
sound simple and easy. What makes it difficult is the fact that our
brain is not made to search for truth. It is but another organ of
survival like fangs or claws, so the brain does not search for truth,
but for advantage. It tries to make us accept this truth, what is only
self interest, allowing our thoughts to be dominated by our desires.


<H2> Philosopher J. Krishnamurthy on nature </H2>

The tree trunks were dark due to heavy rain the previous night. The
sun, playing hide and seek behind the clouds, was throwing out
diffused light which seemed to lend an aritificiality to the scene. A
boy wearing a pair of muddied trousers was playing with an earthworm.
Two villagers passed by talking earnestly. The whole scene was still,
the breeze having spent its force the previous day. The sun moved out
of a patch of clouds and all of a sudden, the place was lit up with
bright clear light. There was an all pervading goodness in the air
which could be readily felt - it was indeed joyous.

<H2> Taoist Chuang Tzu </H2>

No one seems to know how useful it is to be useless.
