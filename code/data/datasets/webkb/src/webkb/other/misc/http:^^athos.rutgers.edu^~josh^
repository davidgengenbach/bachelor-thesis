I am co-PI of the <!WA1><a href="http://athos.rutgers.edu/~josh/cam.html">Rutgers CAM Project</a>,
an ARPA-sponsored effort to design a cost-effective general-purpose
associative memory architecture.

I am moderator of <!WA2><a href="http://nanotech.rutgers.edu/nanotech/index.html">sci.nanotech</a>, and the 
nanotechnology editor for Extropy.
<p>
I'm a consultant as "subject matter expert" in computer architecture to
the <!WA3><a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/hpcd/hpcd.html">Rutgers HPCD Project</a>.

My research interests also include reversible computing for low-power
architecture.
