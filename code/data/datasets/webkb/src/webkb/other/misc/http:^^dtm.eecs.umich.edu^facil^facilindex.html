University of Michigan DTM Center builds its foundations upon many years
of basic and applied research activities in IC processing and design,
electronic device design, 
solid-state electronic and electro-optic materials research, industrial
simulation and modeling, and electronics manufacturing in investigating
the various issues confronting the design and production of flat panel
displays.<P>The DTM Center directly uses facilities, laboratories, and
infrastructure, built up over many decades. These include clean room
facilities like the Solid-State Electronics
Laboratory (SSEL) or research centers that span electronics manufacturing,
sensors technology, plasma processing, or materials reserach.<P>The
laboratory facilities for DTM include the SSEL clean room, the new
Electronics Manufacturing Laboratory(EML) clean room, and numerous
laboratories located in the College of Engineering.<P><br><P><B><FONT

square-foot, class 100 clean room facility, the product of a decade of investment in solid-state semiconductor faculty , research staff, and facilities.  Years of consistent state funding, leveraged with federal grants and contracts, have helped the 
facility evolve into the most modern and complete in the United States 
for solid-state device research. It is a complete silicon IC and III-V 
compound device laboratory with facilities that include electron beam 
lithography, device and circuits characterization, chemical vapor 
deposition, dry etching, vacuum deposition and CAD facilities. <P>

DTH=333 ALIGN=left>CISC was created to foster increased integration among the many individuals at the University of Michigan engaged in research on sensing, data acquisition, and advanced signal processing.  Located in the Solid-State Electronics Lab, C
ISC maintains world-class process facilities for the fabrication of integrat

ed sensing systems.  Current research includes work on materials processing and characterization, three-dimensional microstructures, modeling, high-performance interface circuits, biosensors, integrated optoelectronic systems, and microactuators.<P><br
