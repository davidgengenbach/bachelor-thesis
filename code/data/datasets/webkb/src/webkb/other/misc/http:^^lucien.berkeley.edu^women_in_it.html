Computer Science</a><p>

<dd>Run by Ellen Spertus, this is probably one of the best places to 
look for information regarding women in information technology fields.
It includes pointers to her own writings on women in computer science 
(including "Why Are There So Few Female Computer Scientists?") and those
of several other women, as well as pointers to several other major
resources dealing with the issues of women and minorities in
technology and academia.<p>

<dt><!WA30><a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/HTML/YALE/CS/HyPlans/tap/tap.html">TAP:

<dd>The Ada Project at Yale provides a variety of useful resources,
including extensive bibliographies on various issues relating to 
women in technology, lists of Calls for
Participation in Upcoming Events, Fellowship & Grant information,

<dt><!WA64><a href="http://www.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/wise/wise.html">Archives of Women in Science and Engineering</a><p>

<dd>Located at Iowa State University Library
(inaugurated in 1994), the archives exist "to document the history of women in
science and engineering--their social history as well as the story of
their scientific achievements.  Allied with Iowa State's Program for 
Women in Science and Engineering, whose goal is to
encourage women to become scientists and engineers in the future, the
Archives will document the lives and careers of those who have achieved 
this goal in the past. The Archives collects widely in all
fields of engineering and in the physical, earth, life, and
computational sciences, though not in medicine."  An <i>excellent</i>
resource for those researching the history of women's history in the
sciences in this country.<p>

<dt><!WA65><a href="gopher://infolib.lib.berkeley.edu/11/eres/resdbs/womstu/womenbib">The History of Women and Science, Health, and Technology</a><p>

<dd>Available through the U.C. Berkeley Library gopher, this bibliography
was published by the Univ. of Wisconsin System Women's Studies Librarian.
It is organized into six parts: 1. Overviews; 2. Women in the Scientific
Professions; 3. Health & Biology; 4. Home Economics/Domestic Science; 
5. Technology; and 6. Children and Young Adult Literature.  The bibliography
was prepared "to aid colleagues in both designing new gender-centered 
courses and integrating feminist scholarship into existing survey courses...
[and] to make the history of women in the professions more accessible to 
practitioners in the various branches of science, medicine, and technology."<p>

feminist perspective.<p>

<dt><!WA67><a href="http://gertrude.art.uiuc.edu/wits/bibliography1.html">Women and Information Technology: An Annotated Bibliography</a><p>

<dd>A very nice, comprehensive annotated bibliography put together by

perspective on all issues effecting women and their interactions with
technology.  My only complaint is I wish that had enabled a form of access
which didn't make you go through the pages sequentially.  Jerry's tip of
the day: if you go to http://gertrude.art.uiuc.edu/wits/ you'll get a
directory listing which includes all of the bibliography pages.  Helpful
if you want to skip around a little within the bibliography.<p>

<dt><!WA117><a href="http://www.virago-net.com/brillo">BRILLO Extra Abrasive</a><p>

<dd>A publication which appears to be tackling head-on the issue that
the Internet is male-dominated sphere (and a rather viciously
maintained one at that).  Here's their initial description from their press release:<p>

<i>Brillo is an electronic magazine challenging the exclusion of 
white women and people of color from new technologies.  We hope to show 
that there are people and organizations out there changing how we think 
about technology in significant and productive ways.  And we're not just 
talking about the Internet and the WWW, but about how talented, brave 
people are challenging paradigms of all kinds -- paradigms that actively 
exclude "minorities" from a broad spectrum of cultural activites and 
pursuits -- from the media to business to electronic resources.  We hope 
that we can provide not simply ideology, but practical examples and 
models of how these paradigms can be changed and how we can create 
useful alliances to effect substantial social change.  Always aggressive 
and always abrasive, this first issue of Brillo, "Armed and Dangerous," 
seeks to empower and inform the 15.5%.  (Statistic from the Guerilla 
Girls - The Internet is 84.5% male.)</i><p>

The initial isue consists mainly of interviews, including interviews
with Daria Ulunga from <i>Plugged In</i>, DeeDee Halleck from <i>Paper
Tiger Television</i>, and Brandee Amber Selck of IUMA.  Worth
watching, particularly if they expand editorial content to include
non-interview materials.<p>

biographical encyclopedia of famous american women (yes, Grace Hopper
