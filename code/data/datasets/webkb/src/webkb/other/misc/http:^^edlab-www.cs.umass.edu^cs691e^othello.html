<h1>Othello - CMPSCI 591E/691E</h1>

<p>
<ul>
<li>There is <!WA0><a href="ftp://ftp.cs.umass.edu/pub/internet-games/othello-2.15.tar.gz">software</a>
    that facilitates writing an Othello player program that can compete with other player
    programs over the internet.  The distribution includes a starter program that plays
    a legal but otherwise random game.
<li>For those using the EdLab machines, the software is already installed on
    /users/users2/cs691e/cs691e.
<li>Current <!WA1><a href="http://edlab-www.cs.umass.edu/cs691e/othello-addresses.html">player program addresses</a> are available.
    Put these in .othellorc on your home directory.
<li>Current <!WA2><a href="http://edlab-www.cs.umass.edu/cs691e/othello-standings.html">standings<a> are available.
