Routing 
 - processing nodes (hosts) 
 - switches 
 - communication links 

 
Datagram routing

   *  each packet is routing independently 

   *  unordered, unreliable



Virtual Circuit routing
   *  set up a path for each connection

   *  all messages are sent over this path
 
   *  ordered, reliable

Source Routing 

  *   entire route is determined at the source

  *   message carries the route

  
 
Routing table 
  -  next hop information 
      At each node i, 
        for each destination, what is the next hop 

 

Routing Algorithms 

     - network as a graph 
      
     - each edge has a weight


 
Shortest path tree 

          b ----------d
         /|      2    |
       2/ |           |
       /  |           |
      a   | 1         | 1
       \  |           |
       3\ |           |
         \|     2     |
	  c---------- e
 
    - tree per destination

 
 
A simple protocol: 

Sink:
    distance_sink = 0; parent_sink = sink
    send M(0) to all neighbors;
    do 
      receive M(x) from any neighbor j --> skip  
    od 

Any other node i: 
     distance_i  = infinity;
     do 
       receive M(x) from any neighbor j -->  
                  if x + weight(i,j) < distance_i
		     then  distance_i = x + weight(i,j); parent_i := j
		           send M(distance_i) to all neighbors except j
    od




 
Problems: number of messages
