<h1>CSE 5257:  Assignment #2</h1>

<p>
<em>Due: Friday, September 13, 1996.</em>
</p>


<p>
Do one of the following problems:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>(Kamin and Reingold, 5.13a.)
      Write a Java program to determine all integers less than
      3,000,000 with the property that they equal the sum of factorials
      of their digits; 145=1!+4!+5! for example.
      </p>
      
  <li><p>(Kamin and Reingold, 3.14a.)
      Write a Java program to determine if someone is obese or not.
      The Centers of Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia,
      determine obesity by computing a person's "body mass index."
      The body mass index is a person's weight in kilograms divided
      by the square of his or her height in meters.
      For men, an index of 27.8 or more is considerd obese;
      for nopregnant women the cutoff is 27.3.
      Write a program to read a person's sex, height, and weight,
      determine the body mass index, and print a message as to obesity.
      Your program should convert height from inches to meters
      (one meter is 39.37 inches) and weight
      from pounds to kilograms (one kilogram is 2.20 pounds).
      </p>
      
  <li><p>(Kamin and Reingold, 3.11.)
      The musical scale in common use today is the equal-tempered chromatic
      scale with standard concert pitch of the fourth-octive A being 440 hertz.
      The twelve notes of each octave are logarithmically spaced.
      If we number the notes.
      <pre>
      1     2     3     4     5    6     7     8     9    10    11     12
      C  C-sharp  D   E-flat  E    F  F-sharp  G  G-sharp  A  B-flat    B
      </pre>
      the following formula relates the note numbers and frequencies in hertz:
      <pre>
      log2(Frequency/55) = OctiveNumber + (NoteNumber - 22)/12
      </pre>
      where the octave number is according to the standard scheme in which
      middle C begins at octave nubmer 4.
      Write a program to read a frequency and print the closest note
      and octave number.

  <li><p>(Kamin and Reingold, 8.1.)
      Write a recusive function to compute the Jacobi symbol J(a,n),
      defined for relatively prime integers a and , a&gt;0 and n&gt;0 by
      the formula
      <pre>
                  1                                  if a=1,
      J(a,n) =    J(a/2,n)(-1)**((n**2-1)/8)         if a is even,
                  J(n mod a, a)(-1)**((a-1)(n-1)/4)  ow.
      </pre>

</ul>
