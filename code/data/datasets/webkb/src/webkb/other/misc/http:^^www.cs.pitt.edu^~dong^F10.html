Lab Policies:

1. Students are required to preview the direction sheet carefully before the
   Lab. Since the time of each lab is limited, this is very IMPORTANT to let
   you finish the activities sheet in the Lab.

2. All lab activity sheets must be turned in at the end of the lab period. No
   delay can be accepted.

3. Students who want to switch lab time must inform the TA in advance, in case
   there won't be available position.

4. For the hand-in of programming assignments, students are required to include
   both EXECUTABLE file and source files in the floppy disk. 10 points will be
   deducted from the score if executable file is not included.
