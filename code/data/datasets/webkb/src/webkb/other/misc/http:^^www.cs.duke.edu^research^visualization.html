<H2>Generalized Swift-Hohenberg Eqaution</H2></A>
<H4>MPEG movie: approximately 3M in size.</H4>
<P>
This movie was produced by students of Henry Greenside. 
The movie is a numerical simulation of
so-called spiral chaos, a novel dynamical state discovered in
convection experiments last year. The simulation is not of the full
fluid equations but of a simplified model of convection and transition
to turbulence near onset known as the Generalized Swift-Hohenberg
equation. The calculation is in a square periodic domain of size 32Pi
by 32Pi and was started from random initial conditions of low
amplitude. The movie encompasses ten horizontal diffusion times. <P>
