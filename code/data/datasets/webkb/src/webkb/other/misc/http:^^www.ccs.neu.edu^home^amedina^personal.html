<H1> Some Facts about my recent past and my near future... </H1>

<HR>

<P>
Originally, I come from Caracas, <!WA0><A HREF="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amedina/country.html">Venezuela.</A> and
I came to <!WA1><A HREF="http://www.boston.com">Boston</A> in December 1995 to 
start my PhD studies.
<P>

<P>
Currently I am a PhD student in the 
<!WA2><A HREF="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/">
College of Computer Science </A> at 
<!WA3><A HREF="http://www.neu.edu/">Northeastern University</A>. I am working in a 
specific area of computer science some times called: Computational Science.
My goal is to work in interdisciplinary scientific projects that mix the 
knowledge from different areas (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Computer 
Science, etc.) in order to solve real-life problems.
<P>

<P>
But Computer Science is not the only thing in life that draws my attention.
I am very interested in photography as a way to express my self, in astronomy,
poetry, and music. However, as a matter of fact, it is very common not having
enough time to spend as many hours as I would like on them. 
<P> 

<P>
In the near future I am going to continue doing research as part of my 
doctorate preparation and trying to find some time off!.
