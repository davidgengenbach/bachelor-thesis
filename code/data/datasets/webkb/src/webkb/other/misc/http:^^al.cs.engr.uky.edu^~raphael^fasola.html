<h3>Who are we?</h3>

The Appalachian Association of Sacred Harp Singers is an informal group that
meets to sing from the Sacred Harp shape-note tradition.  We also sing from
Southern Harmony.  The group was formed around 1980.  Our mailing list contains
over 40 singers.  Our monthly sings generally draw about 12 singers.  Our
yearly convention is attended by about 40 singers from surrounding states.
<p>
All singers, whether trained or not, whether you can read shapes or not, are
always welcome.  We always have extra books (which you can buy if you want) 
at our sings.  Everyone who wants gets a chance to pick and lead songs; we
provide free &quot;on the job&quot; training.
<p>
We have a fairly informal structure.  The organizing committee currently
includes
<!WA1><a href="mailto:mlbrin00@pop.uky.edu">Mary Brinkman (past song leader)</a>,
<!WA2><a href="mailto:CHCOUL01@ukcc.uky.edu">Charles Coulston (treasurer)</a>,
<!WA3><a href="http://al.cs.engr.uky.edu/~raphael/index.html">Raphael Finkel (song leader)</a>,
<!WA4><a href="mailto:lsgive1@ukcc.uky.edu">Lyndra Givens</a>,
<!WA5><a href="mailto:phy156@ukcc.uky.edu">Keith MacAdam</a>,
<!WA6><a href="mailto:rmeek54393@aol.com">Bob Meek</a>,
and
<!WA7><a href="mailto:rapen01@ukcc.uky.edu">Ron Pen</a>.
Every singing, someone is appointed by the song leader to be the convener;
the convener makes sure everyone who wants has a chance to lead.


<h3>When and where do we meet?</h3>

We meet the second Sunday of every month except June, July, and August at the
Chapel Hill Presbyterian Church in
<!WA8><A HREF="http://www.uky.edu/KentuckyAtlas/ky-lexington.html">Lexington</A>,
Kentucky (corner of Tates Creek and Armstrong Mill).
<p>
Our annual convention is the Saturday before the third Sunday in May.
We have held the convention in the Pisgah Presbyterian Church a few miles West
of Lexington since 1995.
<p>
We also present occasional concerts at local churches and art venues.

<h3>What is shape note?</h3>

Shape note is an early American form of notation for untrained church choirs.
Each note is written not only on ordinary staff lines (for those
who can read them) but also with a shape that indicates its position in the
scale.  There are 7-shape schemes.  The books we sing from use a 4-shape
scheme, with the notes in a major scale as follows:

<h3>Can I see some?</h3>

to see what we sang at the 1995 Kentucky State Sacred Harp Convention.

<h3>What does it cost?</h3>

We have no dues or other fees.  We raise stamp money by an occasional paid
engagement. 
We pass the hat at the yearly convention to cover the cost of publishing our
minutes.
