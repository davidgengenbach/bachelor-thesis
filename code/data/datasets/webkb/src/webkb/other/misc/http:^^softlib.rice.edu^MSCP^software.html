<Title>The Compiler Itself</Title>

<em>This page is still under construction.</em><hr>

<h1>Software</h1> To meet our goals, we are building a prototype
compiler system.  It is intended as a laboratory instrument for the
study of compilation techniques rather than as a commercially
competitive compiler.<p>

The compiler is structured as a series of passes; all the passes
(except the first and last) consume and produce the intermediate
language ILOC (pronounced "eye-lock").<p>

We make the <!WA0><a href=http://softlib.rice.edu/MSCP/nuweb.html>web</a> form of the code for each 
pass available via 
<!WA1><a href=ftp://cs.rice.edu/public/preston/optimizer>anonymous ftp</a> as it 
becomes stable.  The webs are in PostScript (tm); remember that 
we intend them as guides to help you implement these techniques
in your compiler rather than as things you compile up and run.
