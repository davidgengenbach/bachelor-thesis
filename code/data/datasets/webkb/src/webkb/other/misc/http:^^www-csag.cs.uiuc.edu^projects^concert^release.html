<H1>Concert Software Release</H1>


The Concert System is available on a variety of <!WA0><A
HREF="http://www-csag.cs.uiuc.edu/projects/concert/platforms.html"> parallel platforms</A>.  Compiler runs on
recent Sparc machines, and the compiler requires at least 32MB of RAM
to run the compiler comfortably; more memory will help
performance when compiling large programs.  We are currently
supporting only a single configuration of the Concert system.  In
order to make Concert work on your system, you must have the
following:

<UL>
<LI> Sparcstation 4,5,10, or 20 with 32+ MB of memory
<LI> GNU's g++ compiler version 2.7.2
<LI> GNU's gmake, a make program is used to build Concert
executables, so you cannot compile programs without it.  Any version of
gmake should work fine.
<LI> GNU Emacs version 18 or 19.  Emacs is required to run the Concert 
Debugger and the Emacs interface to the Concert Compiler and Emulator.
</UL>

See the <!WA1><A HREF="http://www-csag.cs.uiuc.edu/projects/concert/release-notice.html">Concert System release
notice</A> for more information.  All of these programs are freely
available from numerous anonymous FTP sites; if you do not have one or
more of them, use archie to find the FTP site nearest you.  If you
don't know how to use archie, clicking <!WA2><A
HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu">here</A> will connect you to the
main GNU software server, <TT>prep.ai.mit.edu</TT>.
  <P>


The Concert System is publicly available from the Concurrent System
Architecture Group at the University of Illinois.  It will come as a tar file,
and can be installed simply by untarring it.  The software is <EM>not</EM> in
the public domain; it is offered freely for use in education and research.
  <P>


To obtain the current release of Concert Software, click on the button
below.  The release is over 19MB, even in compressed form, so it may
take a while to download. 4.0 is the newest version of Concert, supporting
our new langauge ICC++. The compiler in Concert 4.0 has been tuned for
ICC++, and so the 3.0 compiler is more robust for Concurrent Aggregates. 
  <P>
