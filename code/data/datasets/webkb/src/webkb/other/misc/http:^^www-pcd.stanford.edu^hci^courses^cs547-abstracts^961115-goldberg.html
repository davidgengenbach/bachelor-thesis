Jobs in commercial software development are team jobs. The teams build
systems that bring value to their customers. New hires, whether fresh out of
school or transferring from other commercial projects, are successful only
if they can contribute to the team's goals. Yet the formal education of
these new
hires emphasized programming, not system building, and rarely offered team
experience in creating and maintaining large systems. What might a
curriculum focused on teaching system building contain? 
<P>

Faced with that question, I set out to design a new system that would
support authoring and delivering such a curriculum. The result is
<!WA6><A HREF="http://sumeru.stanford.edu/learningworks">LearningWorks</A> , available for free on the Internet. The purpose of this talk is to
discuss the user interface design for LearningWorks, specifically how the
simple metaphor of learning books can be used both to teach software system
building concepts and to support teams in building systems.

using object-oriented technology.  Dr. Goldberg edited "The History of
Personal Workstations," published jointly by the ACM and Addison-Wesley in
1988 as part of the ACM Press Book Series of the History of Computing which
she organized, and co-edited "Visual Object-Oriented Programming" with
Margaret Burnett and Ted Lewis.  In 1995, a new book on software engineering
appeared entitled "Succeeding With Objects: Decision Frameworks for Project
Management" with Kenneth S. Rubin.  
<P>

She was recipient of the ACM Systems Software Award in 1987 along with Dan
Ignalls and Alan Kay, PC Magazine's 1990 Lifetime Achievement Award for her
significant contributions to the personal computer industry, is a Fellow of
the ACM, and was honored in 1995 with the Reed College Howard Vollum Award
for contributions to science and technology.  She is currently a member of
the scientific advisory board of the German National Research Centers (GMD),
