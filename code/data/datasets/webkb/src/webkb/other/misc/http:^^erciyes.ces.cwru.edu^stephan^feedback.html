<H2>CMPS131 C++ Feedback Form</H2>

Since the format of CMPS131 is new, it may not always run as smoothly
as we have anticipated.  Because of this, we know that the course may
need some tweaking along the way.  All of use involved in teaching this
course value the comments, criticisms and suggestions of the students.
<P>
In order for your feedback to have a positive effect on your classroom
experience, we must hear it as soon as possible and not wait until the 
"safe" evaluation period at the end of the semester.  Although we would
prefer to hear your comments personally, we realize that this may not
always be easy to do.
