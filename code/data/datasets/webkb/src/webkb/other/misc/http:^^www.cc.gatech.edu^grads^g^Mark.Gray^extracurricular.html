<H1>Mark Gray's Extracurricular Page</H1>

I live in beautiful suburbia in the Atlanta area. My <!WA0><a
href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/grads/g/Mark.Gray/.plan">address</a> is in Decatur but that is inside the 285
loop in north DeKalb county not far from 285 and 85 north. Driving to
Georgia Tech takes from 15 minutes to an hour depending on when it is
attempted and by whom. If I know you (or you have some reason to think
I would like to) and you are visiting Atlanta, let me know. If you
need a place to stay, I might even offer you one of my spare beds for
a couple of days. 
<P>
Georgia Tech organizations I spend time with include:
<UL>
<LI> <!WA1><A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/users/craig/orgt.html">ORGT</A> 
which sponsors activities like skiing and 
<!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/grads/g/Mark.Gray/image/Rafting1280.jpg">rafting</A>
<LI> <!WA3><A HREF="http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~dsadmef/">The Environmental Forum</A>
<LI> <!WA4><A HREF="http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~spc/">Student Pagan Community</A>
<LI> <!WA5><A HREF="http://www.ee.gatech.edu/users/190/sca.html">Society for Creative Anachronism</A>
</UL>

Outside Tech I am a member of the 
<!WA6><A HREF="http://www.caw.org/">Church of All Worlds</A>, 
a religion originally inspired by 
<!WA7><A HREF="http://www.boondock.com/rahpage.htm">Heinlein</A>'s
<!WA8><A HREF="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/grads/g/Mark.Gray/image/SIASL.275.jpg">Stranger in a Strange Land</A>. 
Our local "congregation" is the 
<!WA9><A HREF="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/grads/g/Mark.Gray/phoenix/">Proto-Nest of the Phoenix</A>. 
<P>
I learned HTML by creating a hypertext version of the 
<!WA10><a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/grads/g/Mark.Gray/Sex_Laws.html">sex laws</A> of Georgia and Kansas. Since then
the index has grown to include many states and some other countries
and the page has had over 25,000 hits.
<P>
I didn't like any version of the <!WA11><A HREF="http://www.wam.umd.edu/~sek/purity.html">purity test</A> so I edited the largest one I could find into <!WA12><A HREF="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/grads/g/Mark.Gray/purity/400.html">one I like</A> (400 questions, 8,000 hits).
<P>
Web sites where I have spent money and been satisfied:
<UL>

<!WA16><A HREF="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/grads/g/Mark.Gray/key.html">PGP key</A>.
