  Brief coverage of standard database concepts: relational model,
  file systems, physical implementation of databases. Spatial
  databases: computational geometry, spatial relations, spatial
  data structures, query processing. Text processing: search
  techniques, compression methods. Image databases: storage issues,
  compression methods, image indexing, searching by content.
  Additional topics from multimedia and temporal databases.
  Students will implement various algorithms discussed in class.

  <li> <b> Prerequisites: </b>
     <ul> 
        <li> 
           An undergraduate algorithms course (e.g. CS 313)

  Traditional databases cover the standard relational model that is
  particularly suited to applications in banking and commerce. 
  The type of data stored has usually been alphanumeric in nature.
  For example, an employee database has data about employee names,
  their addresses, salaries, departments etc. Queries typically
  involve finding items and sorting items. Today, databases are 
  starting to be used to store non-alphanumeric data. For example,
  a county planning office wants to store detailed maps of property,
  of electrical wiring and drainage systems. In another example,
  images of products are stored in a product catalog. Typical 
  queries for these types of databases include questions like
  "Find me all residential properties within a 5-mile radius of
  this factory" or "Here is a shape of a vase; find me examples in
  the catalog that look like it". The above are examples of
  spatial (or geographic) databases and image databases.
  <p>
  While traditional relational databases are well-understood, the
  same cannot be said about spatial and image databases. This 
  course will explore the science behind these types of databases.
  Both theory and practice will be considered. The course will
  start by asking how traditional tree data structures can be
  modified for spatial data. From there, computational issues
  about geometry - computational geometry - will be covered.
  Some issues concerning spatial and geographic databases will
  be addressed next: how to store data, and how to specify and
  process queries. The material on image databases will start 
  with storage problems: how to compress 2-D images effectively.
  Following this, some material regarding the organization of
  image databases will be presented. Additional topics include
  multimedia database issues and temporal database issues.
