<h2>Major Research Activities</h2>

The High-Performance Computing and Software Laboratory at the
University of Texas at San Antonio was established in early 1993.
It has
been equipped with sufficient resources to allow extensive study
of high-performance computing for systems and scientific applications.
This laboratory is supporting a variety of
research projects investigating both the fundamental nature of
high-performance computing and its application to problems of importance in
software development.
The principal research efforts are:
