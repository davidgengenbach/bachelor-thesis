Originally from Athens, Greece (in case you have not already guessed
so), I am currently a PhD student at the Computer Science department
of Northeastern University; projected <em>graduation date is
12/96</em> (<!WA0><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/yiannis/news.html">confirmed</a>). My <!WA1><a
href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/yiannis/pubs.html">research</a> is on cryptography, with concentration
in electronic cash and applications, and for the last year has been
conducted at GTE Laboratories in Waltham, MA.
