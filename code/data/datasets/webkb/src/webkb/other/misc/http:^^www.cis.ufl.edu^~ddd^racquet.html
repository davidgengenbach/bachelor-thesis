<title>  The Racqueteers  </title>

<h1>  The Racqueteers  </h1>

<h3>  This is an informal group of faculty and students within the C.I.S.E 
Department that has formed to play racquetball on a regular basis.  </h3>

Several faculty and students get together on Tuesday and Thursday
afternoons at 4 p.m. in the Student Rec Center near the Florida
Pool to play Racquetball.  Any and all are welcome to join our group, 
but you must let us know at least one day in advance that you will 
be playing.  The coordinator of games will send a message out to all 
members of the group one day before games to determine the number of 
courts that are needed.  Courts will then be reserved for us to play.  
The skill level of those currently playing varies widely from starting 
players to very skilled, so none should feel that they will not be 
welcome to play.  <P>

A mail alias has been created to allow members of the group to 
communicate with each other concerning who is playing and if we 
are playing.  If you would like to receive these messages you should 
send a mail message to ""majordomo@cis.ufl.edu" with the following line
in the body of the message: <P>

<blockquote>  subscribe racquet-ball  </blockquote>

To remove yourself from the list send the line:  <P>

<blockquote>  unsubscribe racquet-ball </blockquote>

Hope to see you on the courts!  <P>
