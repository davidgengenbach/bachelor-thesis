Area of research: Datalog programs applied to databases that satisfy 
functional dependencies:<P>
Datalog is a declarative query language based on first order logic. A 
Datalog program is a query whose input is a relational database and whose 
output is another database. Datalog programs are more expressive than 
relational queries since they can express recursive queries (for instance, 
the transitive closure problem is expressible in Datalog). My research 
focused on how to efficiently process recursive Datalog programs, and 
how constraints in the input to a Datalog program affect constraints in the 
output. Results obtained in datalog research can be applied to extend 
existing relational database managers.<P>

Master of Science in Computer Science. December 1990<P>
Thesis: "Information systems representation using a semantic data 
model''<P>
Description of research: Existing modeling techniques are weak in terms 
of representing behavior of systems. In this work, a graphical technique 
based on semantic modeling is proposed: The Semantic Model with 
Transactions (SMT). SMT allows for the graphical specification of 
objects related to a particular domain. From this specification code can be 
generated to support the basic behavioral aspects of the system, such as 
inserts, deletes, and updates. A prototype of SMT was written using 
C.<P>

PROFESSIONAL INTERESTS<P>

<UL>
My professional interests are: applying existing technology, education, 
and research and development of new areas in database technology. In 
particular, I would like to apply my knowledge on databases and object 
oriented programming to information systems development. Also, I would 
like to participate in the development of new database models, or help 
make existing systems more usable and expressive. Also, I would like to 
work as a consultant to help end users fully exploit existing database 
technology.<P>

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE<P>

<UL>
<B>New Mexico State University</B><P><B>
</B>Las Cruces, N.M.<P>
Research assistant<P>
Research in deductive databases<P>
Developed a general purpose class library for C++. It contained general 
purpose classes such as a string class, a class for Boolean types, and 
several template-based container classes such as lists and sets. Also 
developed a class library for manipulating logic programs. It contained 
classes for logic objects such as programs, rules, atoms, predicates, etc. 
These libraries were used in the implementation and testing of 
transformation algorithms for Datalog programs. They were also used as 
teaching aids.<P>
Instructor of C and C++<P>
January 1991 to date<P>
<B>Universidad Autonoma de Cd. Juarez</B><P><B>
</B>Ciudad Juarez, Chih. Mexico.<P>
Consultant<P>
Participated in a departmental project to build a fully automated, real-time 
production line. Headed the software part of the project. The software was 
to be built using object-oriented techniques for the front end (developed 
using C++ under MS-Windows) and a back end database. Trained other 
participants in object-oriented programming using C++.<P>

<B>Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey</B><P>
Monterrey, N.L.<P>
Research assistant. Researched and developed a nested-relation database 
management system with a graphical interface. The DBMS was written in 
C for MS-Windows. The final system had over 200,000 lines of C code 
and more than 20 persons were participating at a given time. Headed the 
development of the graphical editor (over 15,000 lines of C code), the 
module that allows for visual integration and flow of control of the other 
objects in the system (such as forms, reports, and scripts).<P>

system is still in use and is being adapted to run under Windows. Headed 
the deployment (as a consultant) of accounting, inventory, and financial 
analysis systems in several companies<P>
