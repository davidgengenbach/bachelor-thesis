All homework assignment submissions must be neat and legible.  Lab
instructors have instructions to return any illegible homework
assignment submissions with a grade of 0.  If you already know how to
use a word processor,  or have access to a typewriter, you are
encouraged to use them for this assignment, although you may submit
this assignment hand-written as well, if you wish.  Word processing may
be required for homework assignments made later this semester.

<p>

If you are submitting more than one page for a homework assignment, be
sure that your pages are stapled together in the upper-left hand
corner.

<p>

On the front of the first page of your homework assignment submission,
legibly type or write:

<ul>
<li>"CS101 Homework #3"
<li>your name
<li>your CS101 lab instructor's name
<li>your CS101 section number
</ul>

All homework assignment submissions are due at the time and date specified.
No late homework assignment submissions will be accepted.

<p>

Homework assignments, usually to be assigned and collected in lecture
each week, should not be confused with laboratory assignments, which
will be assigned and collected in your computer lab meeting each week.
