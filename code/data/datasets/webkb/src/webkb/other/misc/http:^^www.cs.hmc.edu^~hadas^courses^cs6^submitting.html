</h2> </b>
</center>
<p>

We now have a new program on osiris called <b>submit</b>.
Before you submit your homework, please be sure that your C++
programs end with <tt>.cc</tt> (as in <tt>my_cool_program.cc</tt>)
and that any file that just contains text (such as an essay or
written answers to a question) ends with <tt>.txt</tt> 
(as in <tt>my_answer.txt</tt>).  If your files don't end with these
suffixes, <b>submit</b> will whine and complain and won't deliver
your files to us.
<p>
 
You will submit each part of the homework in a separate file.
Assume that your program for problem 1 on the homework assignment
is called <tt>problem1.cc</tt>.  Then, type <tt>submit
problem1.cc</tt>.  The program will then ask you some questions.
First, it will ask you:
<br> <br>
<tt>What assignment are you submitting?</tt> <br> <br>
If you enter 2 that stands for Assignment 2.  Next it will ask you:
<br> <br>
<tt>
What problem from the assignment are you submitting?
</tt>
<br> <br>
If the assignment has six parts, you will enter a number between 1 and
6 in response.  Then the program will ask you if this is a first
submission or a regrade.  I'll talk about regrades in class, but for
now choose first submission.
Don't worry that the program doesn't ask who you
are or what class you're submitting a homework for.  The <b>submit</b>
program figures all that out by itself. (If it gets confused, it 
sends e-mail to one of the CS 5 or CS 6 professors for help.)
Similarly, if your file is a text file (not a program), just type
<tt>submit filename.txt</tt>.
