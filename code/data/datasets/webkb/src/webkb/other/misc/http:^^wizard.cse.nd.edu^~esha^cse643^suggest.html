<H2> The Suggestions of 
<!WA0><A href="http://wizard.cse.nd.edu/~esha/cse643/present1.html"> Research Papers to be Presented
</a> </H2>

I will not just hand in the papers for you to read, but I will
give you some pointers for you to look for more papers in the
following areas. There are several journals and conferences
are important to go through such as IEEE Transactions on 
Parallel and Distributed Systems, Proceedings of ICPP, IPPS, SPDP, etc.
Please come to see me, and I may give you some starting papers.
 
<UL>
<LI> Cache Issues: Cache Design, Cache Coherence
<LI> Branch Prediction Issues           
<LI> Data Dependency Analysis, Distribution and Partitions
<LI> Loop Transformation Techniques 
<LI> Data Locality for Distributed Shared Memory Systems
<LI> Task Partitions and Scheduling
<LI> Multicast Routing Techniques
<LI> Interconnection Networks Issues
<LI> Issues on Real-Time Systems
<LI> Fault Tolerance
<LI> Memory or DISK IO Organizations 
<LI> Parallel Programming Languages Survey 
</UL>

<H2> The Suggestions of Term Projects </H2>
Term projects can be done by either a group of two or
individual.
One possible project is to come out some ideas and do 
simulation to verify your idea.
For example, you can simulate some routing teachniques,
scheduling techniques, interconnection networks,
data distributions, branch prediction, cache 
coherence, etc.
I don't want you to waste your time, so please do something
interest you.
