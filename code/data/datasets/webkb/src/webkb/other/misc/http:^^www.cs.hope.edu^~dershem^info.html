<h2><a name="proj1">Project 1: Concurrency Anomaly Prevention Using Java Threads (<!WA10><a href="http://www.cs.hope.edu/~jipping/mjj.html">Michael J. Jipping</a>)</h2>
This project will implement the prediction and detection of concurrency anomalies in the language Java. This will implement detection methods as parallel threads in Java that monitor concurrent activity and detect when concurrent threads will damage a shared resource. We will be spending time with both threads programming and anomaly detection methods.
<p>
<h2><a name="proj2">Project 2: Implementing Parallel Software Design Tools (<!WA11><a href="http://www.cs.hope.edu/~jipping/mjj.html">Michael J. Jipping</a>)</h2>
This project will focus on integrating design tools for parallel programs into a workable software development environment and demonstrating the usefulness of this environment. Specifically, we will build prototype design tools and evaluate these tools for usability, accuracy, and fitness for existing environments.
<p>
<h2><a name="proj3">Project 3: Animations of Algorithms and Object-Oriented Concepts (<!WA12><a href="http://www.cs.hope.edu/~dershem/hld.html">Herbert L. Dershem</a>)</h2>
This project will focus on the development and use of tools for animations within the framework of the Java programming language. One aspect will be the use of animations to illustrate object-oriented concepts by creating algorithm animation classes that will make such animations nearly transparent to the algorithm implementor. Another aspect will involve the animation of data structure algorithms adapting the techniques of the THREADS package that was developed by previous research projects.	
<p>
<h2><a name="proj4">Project 4: Visualization of String Searching Algorithms (<!WA13><a href="http://www.cs.hope.edu/~dershem/hld.html">Herbert L. Dershem</a>)</h2>
Approaches will be investigated for visualizing the processes of various string searching algorithms. These will include Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore, and Rabin-Karp methods. Java applets will be written to implement the visualization techniques that are designed.
<p>
<h2><a name="proj5">Project 5: Parallelization of Global Optimization Software (<!WA14><a href="http://www.cs.hope.edu/~rvaniwaa">Ronald Van Iwaarden</a>)</h2>
Professor Van Iwaarden has developed a global optimization software package called VerGO. It solves global optimization problems using interval arithmetic and automatic differentiation. This project will develop a version of VerGO using MPI and PVM. Both of these versions will be tested on a network of Sun workstations to evaluate the efficiency of the different parallel implementations when running on either a single, multiple CPU machine or on many single CPU machines.
