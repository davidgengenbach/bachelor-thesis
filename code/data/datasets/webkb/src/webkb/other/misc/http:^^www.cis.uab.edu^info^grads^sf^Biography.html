<h3> Childhood </h4>
I grew up, more or less, in Delaware. Born in Dover on 1 December, 1963, my family moved to nearby Camden, DE when my father left the Air Force. At the age of 7, I move to Wilmington, DE and again at 13 to Dayton, OH and, two years later, to Birmingham, AL where I attended high school.

I am the youngest of 5 children, 2 girls and 3 boys. 

<h3> High School </h3>
I attended high scool at Pelham HS, just south of Birmingham, AL. It was not an extravagant or superior school but I tried to make the most of it. I participated in the choir (bass) and band (saxaphone). I also was active in Junior Achievement and attended the National JA Conference two years in a row.
