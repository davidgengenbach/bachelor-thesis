<title>Basic Etiquette</title>

<H1>Whining Lowers Grades</H1>

You are always welcome and encouraged to discuss exams and
homeworks with your professor;  it is an excellent way to
learn from your mistakes.  If the grading does not make sense
to you, please ask.  You may not yet have understood your mistake
-- or there may be an error in the grading.

However, whining, demanding a regrade instead of requesting one,
or saying that you deserve more points is a good way to convince
a professor to regrade your entire assignment or exam, perhaps
with a more careful attention to your mistakes.<p>

<H1>Appointments</H1>

If you make an appointment with a professor, keep it.  Otherwise,
let them know, if possible in advance, that you will not be keeping
your appointment.  Try:  calling their office;  sending email;  leaving
a message with the department secretary.<p>
<HR><p>

<H1>Late Homeworks</H1>
If you put your homework under your professor's door, it will almost certainly
get footprints on it.  Your professor might notice it, and it might even
get graded.  A better approach is to
discuss the fact that it will be late <em>ahead of time</em> with 
your professor, and agree on a method of handing it in.<p>
<HR><p>

<H1>Women and Men</H1>

Women professors are not necessarily motherly, or more nurturing
in the classroom.  That's not their job.
Treat them as you would a male professor.  "But you don't seem
like a professor to me," is <em>not</em> a complement.
They <em>are</em> professors.<p>
<HR><p>

<H1>Recommendations</H1>

If you want a professor to write you a letter of recommendation,
<em>ask before</em> listing them as a reference.  In fact, ask them
far enough in advance (a) for them to write the letter before it's
due (a minimum of 2 weeks) or prepare a verbal response, and (b) that
you can find another recommender if they say no.<p>

If you want a letter that says more than, "She was a good student,
who earned an A," you should be ready to supply your recommenders
with 
<ul>
<li>a copy of your resume, 
<li>transcript (or list of courses taken
and grades earned), 
<li>a description of recent and relevant independent
work, 
<li>and a description of your
career plan (at least through the job or school experience for which
you are being recommended).  
</ul>
When you ask for a recommendation, offer
copies of these to your recommender.<p>
