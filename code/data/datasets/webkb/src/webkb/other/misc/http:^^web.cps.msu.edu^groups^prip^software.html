<h1> PRIP Software Packages</h1>

<h3> Where is PRIP software located? </h3>

The most important thing to remember when accessing PRIP software is
where to find it.  In <b>/soft/prip</b> there are <b>bin</b>,
<b>lib</b>, <b>include</b>, <b>doc</b>, and <b>man</b> page
directories.  These directories house links that reference the PRIP
resources in each of the packages in the /soft/prip hierarchy.  To
avoid having each user need to know where each program is located,
these directories are maintained to simplify things.  Though not
advised, you may access the individual packages in /soft/prip.
However, individual software packages aren't guaranteed to stay in the
same places.

<p>
Therefore, <b>including /soft/prip/bin in your PATH</b> allows access
to all PRIP executables.  <b>When compiling software, include -I
/soft/prip/include and -L /soft/prip/lib</b> to allow inclusion of
PRIP specific libraries and include files.  Documentation that comes
with each package is linked into the doc directory.  Adding
<b>/soft/prip/man to your MANPATH</b> will allow access to all PRIP
man pages.
