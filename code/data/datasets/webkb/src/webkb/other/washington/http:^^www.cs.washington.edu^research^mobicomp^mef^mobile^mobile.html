<h1> <a name="top">MEF's Mobile Computing Page</a></h1>

My interest in mobile computing stems from ongoing research at Rutgers
University, where I was an undergraduate.  At the University of
Washington I am part of a group working in the area.  I am interested
in the systems aspects of mobile computing and hope to stumble over
academic research in this area by immersing myself into a mobile
environment.  

<p>

For our research we initially worked with the hardware and software
infrastructure built around the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center's
(PARC) ``Ubiquitous Computing Project.''  The hardware includes
low-power, <!WA0><a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/mobicomp/mef/mobile/apr30_13.gif>infrared transceivers</a> and <!WA1><a
href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/mobicomp/mef/mobile/apr30_12.gif>handheld pen-based tablets</a>. The software
includes an application suite and service <!WA2><a
href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/mobicomp/mef/mobile/system.ps>infrastructure</a> that allows the handheld devices to
operate with stationary applications.

<p>

Our current research is described in the <!WA3><a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/mobicomp/mobile.html">UW
Mobile Computing</a> home page. This fall <!WA4><a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/elf">Terri Watson</a> will be
joining our research group, who has been working on <!WA5><a

Marc's immediate project is to write a device driver for the PROXIM
rangelan2 wireless ethernet card.  This work is part of his <!WA6><a

Computing Independent Project</a>.

Marc is also interested in PCMCIA devices and how they tie into mobile
computing:
