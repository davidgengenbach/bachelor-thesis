resulting question.

<H2>Part 2: Mini-project</H2>

Choose one or more of the following aspects of your education here
at the University of Washington.  
<UL>
<LI> the goals of your undergraduate education (in terms of mastery
of subject matter, jobs, social objectives, family objectives, etc.);
<LI> the goals you have in taking this course on artificial intelligence;
<LI> academic advice you would give to a freshman or
sophomore who aspires to major in computer science and engineering;
<LI> the programming skills or computer science concepts you have learned here.
</UL>
Describe that (or those) aspect(s) in English.  This should be
a paragraph of several sentences, including not only simple facts,
but "rules" --- generalizations that will permit inferences to be made.
<p>
Now encode the English sentences in the predicate calculus.
You should end up with: (1) several simple facts of the form P(a)
(but using more descriptive "non-standard" notation), (2) at least
one rule using a universal quantifier, (3) at least one
formula using an existentially quantified variable,
and (4) at least one use of each of the logical connectives
Or, And, Implies, and Not.  You may need to adjust your English
paragraph in order to be able to obtain all of these features in
your formulas.
<p>
Identify and describe the domain you are assuming for your formulas.
<p>
State your intended meaning for each predicate symbol, function
symbol, and constant that you use.
<p>
How well do you feel your logical formulas represent the information
in the English paragraph?  Is anything missing in the logical version?
Does the logical version say anything that the English version does not?
