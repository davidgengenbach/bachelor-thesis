        I left a copy of an OPS 5 Tutorial at the Copy Center, Second floor,
Engineering Library, yesterday at 1 pm. Please pick up your copy. You
should read it even if you are not doing the assigned final project.

CSE 415      Final Programming Project     Due Monday, June 3, 1996
					(at final exam)
                                        (Use "Turnin" as directed).


        Write a Lisp program to implement selected features of the OPS 5
Expert Systems Building Tool.
        Your program should be able to run small systems specified in
OPS 5 notation. It should be able to interpret and use the following
features:

        Facts in Working Memory which are represented as

                 Objects with associated attribute-value pairs

                (No need to implement Vectors of Symbols)

        Rules as specified on page 6 of the tutorial, with the <pattern>
        specification limited to
                <pattern> ::= ( <object> [^<attribute> <value>]+ )

        (The -<pattern> condition does not need to be implemented)


        You will find the use of property lists in Lisp valuable for this.

        Run your program using the Blocks World problem in Appendix I
        of the Tutorial.

        If your program does not solve the given problem, add a control
        feature that will make it work.
