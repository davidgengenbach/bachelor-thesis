<h2>Reading List</h2>

These papers cover a variety of aspects of computer
support for collaborative learning.


<H3>Background Papers</H3>

<DT> 
SIGCUE Outlook on Computer Supported Collaborative Learning, Spring
1992 (Volume 21, number 3).

 <DD> 
Included in this journal is an introduction: "Computer Support
for Collaborative Learning: Design, Theory and Research Issues" by Tim
Koschmann.

<P>
<DT> 
CACM, Volume 39 Number 4.

<DD> 
Recent CACM issue on Learner Centered Design.
<P>
<DT> 
Journal of the Learning Sciences, 1993/1994 - Volume 3, number 3:
Special Issue: Computer Support for Collaborative Learning.  


 <DD> 
Included in this journal are two articles by Tim Koschmann:
"Toward a Theory of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning", and
"Using Technology to Assist in Realizing Effective Learning and
Instruction: A Principled Approach to the Use of Computers in
Collaborative Learning". (Both are pretty thick papers, but may shed
some light on "how to do" CSCL.)

<P>
<DT> 
Clements, D. H and Nastasi, B. K. The Role of Social Interaction in
  the Development of Higher-Order Thinking in Logo Environments, in
  Computer-Based Learning Environments and Problem Solving. E. de-Corte
  and M. C. Linn and H. Mandl and L. Verschaffel, ed. Springer-Verlag,
  1992, pp. 229-247.

<DD> 
Clements and Nastasi tested Logo with children in a cooperative
environment where two kids used one keyboard in order to determine how
conflict and successful resolution helps or hinders learning.  Their
conclusion was that Logo seems to help conflict resolution and
development of higher order thinking.  Co-present, synchronous.

<P>
<DT> 
Dockterman, D. A. Cooperative Learning and Computers, in SIGQUE
  Outlook.  21, 2 (1991), pp 39-43.  

<DD>
Collaborative learning for social studies and history.  He states that
cooperative learning has been overused.  The article also states that
there are obstacles to cooperative learning, such as lack of teacher
experience, too much material to cover, and that computers may help to
overcome these obstacles by assisting in class management, information
flow and record keeping.

Inkpen, K. Booth, K. S.  Klawe, M. and Upitis, R. Playing Together
  Beats Playing Apart, Especially for Girls, in Proc. CSCL'95
  (Bloomington, October 17-20, 1995), ACM Press, N.Y., pp 177-181.

<DD>
This study compared children using "The Incredible Machine" in various
situations: two together on one machine (in same sex and mix sexed
pairs), vs children working independently.  There are other papers
that can be used for back up material, including the E-GEMS tech
report 94-5.  Co-present, synchronous.

<P>
<DT> 
Palmer, J. D. and Fields, N. A. Guest Editor's Introduction: Computer
  Supported Cooperative Work.  IEEE Computer. 27, 5 (May 1994), pp   15-17.  

<DD>
A good introduction to computer supported cooperative work.
Categorizes CSCW modes, and gives a glossary of terms.

<P>
<DT> 
Vockell, E. L. Group Size for Computerized Instruction, in Educational
  Technology   29, 9 (1989), pp.  30-32.

<DD>
This paper begins by describing the three types of learning -
individualistic, competitive, cooperative and the two phases of
learning, learning phase where students receive feed back and
clarifications, and the practice phase, where computers can be useful.
The paper also discusses what group size is good for different phases
and types of learning.

<H3>Systems and applications papers</H3>

Background papers on the different types of systems in CSCW.  How can
we classify these systems?

  Shared Editors on a Single Screen,  in UIST'91, (Hilton Head, November
  11-13, 1991), ACM Press, N.Y., pp 79-86.

<dd>
MMM stands for Multi-Device Multi-User Multi-Editor.  This is the only
other work I've found where they use multiple mice on a single
machine.  It's a good paper and talks about some of the problems of
sharing screen space, etc.  Co-present, synchronous.

Bricker, L., Baker, M., and Tanimoto, S. Support for Cooperatively
  Controlled Objects in Multimedia Applications.  Work in progress.  

 <dd>
This paper presents a
methodology for designing objects that encourage close collaboration
in multimedia environments. A definition is given for cooperatively
controlled objects which distinguishes them from objects whose
components are shared.  Co-present, synchronous.

 <dd>
GroupKit is a set of controls designed to give distance cooperative
users an awareness of their collaborators workspace. This paper
describes "workspace awareness" and some of the controls.  There is
also a suite of papers in CHI'96 which describes more of the controls
and how they can be used.  Distance, synchronous.

describes this system. Distance, Synchronous.
