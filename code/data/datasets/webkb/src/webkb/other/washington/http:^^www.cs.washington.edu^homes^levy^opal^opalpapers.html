<dl><b>Family History</b></dl>

Opal is a descendant of a number of object-oriented distributed
systems built at UW during the 1980s.  Following are some
references to some of those systems. <p>

<UL>

<li> E. Jul, H. Levy, N. Hutchinson, A. Black.  
<a href="emerald.ps">Fine-Grained Mobility in the Emerald
System.</a> <em>ACM Trans. on Computer Systems</em> 6(1), February 1988.
(Emerald is a distributed object-oriented language and system supporting
a single, logical, distributed, object address space.  It was the first
system with on-the-fly object mobility.  Protection is guaranteed by 
the language and compiler.)

<li> J. Chase, F. Amador, E. Lazowska, H. Levy, R. Littlefield.
<a href="amber.ps">The Amber System: Parallel Programming on a Network
of Multiprocessors.</a> <em>Proc. of the 12th ACM Symp. on Operating
Systems Principles</em>, December 1989. (Amber is a distributed object-oriented
system, based on C++, for writing parallel programs that execute on 
a local-area network;  Amber uses a single shared distributed address 
space above which C++ objects are supported.)
