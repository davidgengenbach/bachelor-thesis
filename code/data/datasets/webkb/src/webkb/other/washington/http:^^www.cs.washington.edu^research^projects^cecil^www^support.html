<h1>
Support for the Cecil/Vortex Project
</h1>
<br>

<p>

The Cecil and Vortex projects have been generously supported by a
number of groups.  Some are listed below.

<dl>
<dt> <!WA0><a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">NSF</a>
<dd> Our work has been supported through NSF RIA and NYI grants.

<dt> <!WA1><a href="http://www.arpa.mil/">ARPA</a>
<dd> ARPA is supporting our work (as part of the <!WA2><A
HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www">SPIN
project</A>) on developing advanced compiler technology for safe
systems programming languages, presently an in-house dialect of
Modula-3.

<dt> <!WA3><a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a> <dd> Sun has
donated the bulk of our equipment and also graduate student support.
They also developed the <TT>javac</TT> compiler as part of the JDK,
which we have adapted as our Java front-end for Vortex.

<dt> <!WA4><a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>
<dd> IBM is providing graduate student funding and research
opportunities, in addition to giving lots of equipment to our
department that we use.

<dt> <!WA5><a href="http://pubweb.parc.xerox.com/">Xerox PARC</a>
<dd> Xerox PARC has provided graduate student funding to the project.

<dt> <!WA6><a href="http://www.pure.com/">Pure Software</a>
<dd> Pure has donated some of their development tools, which we
couldn't live without (especially PureLink).

<dt><!WA7><a href="http://www.edg.com">Edison Design Group</a>
<dd>EDG donated source code to their C++ front-end, which we are using
as the base for our C++ front-end for our Vortex compiler.  When we're
done with this, we'll be able to study the effects of our
optimizations on C++ programs.  We expect that our techniques will
enable a more flexible programming style to be used in C++ programs
without great performance penalty.

<dt><!WA8><a href="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/home.html">DEC Systems Research Center</a>
<dd> We're adapting the SRC <!WA9><a
href="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/modula-3/html/home.html">Modula-3</a>
compiler front-end to our Vortex compiler.  Compared to the SRC
implementation of Modula-3, our implementation is striving for
significantly better run-time performance, at the cost of some degree
of separate compilation.
