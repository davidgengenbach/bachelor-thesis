<h2>Providence, RI</h2>
A common response to receive upon asking someone what's good about
living in Providence is "Well, it's an hour away from Boston, four
hours away from New York, near the ocean..."  In other words, for some
people, the best thing about Providence is that it's easy to leave.
Sad, because there are some neat things there.  In no particular order:
<ul>
<li> RISD art museum
<li> RISD book store
<li> the crazy silver diner downtown
<li> Snooker's pool hall
<li> Babe's on the Sunny Side
<li> Apsara's Vietnamese restaurant
<li> Loui's restaurant on the East Side
<li> Ruby's diner on the East Side
<li> sunsets from Prospect Park
<li> the Cable Car cinema (couches and free refills on popcorn)
<li> Tom's Tracks record store
</ul>

<h2>Austin, TX</h2>
It will be a while before Austin recovers from the impact of "Slacker,"
I fear.  Good movie.  Not exactly all of Austin.  Again, in no particular
order, some cool things:
<ul>
<li> monthly city-wide garage sale in the Coliseum
<li> town lake on a sunny day
<li> Kerbey Lane cafe on Kerbey Lane (where I learned that I am not cut
out for customer service)
<li> Hole in the Wall, for music, beer and pool
<li> Antone's, for really good blues
<li> Laguna Gloria museum grounds, for picnics and walks
<li> Mexicarte gallery
<li> Mount Bonnell
<li> breakfast at Las Manitas
<li> whistling in the Rotunda of the Capitol building
<li> <!WA1><a href="http://www.pencom.com/arts/paramount/">the Paramount Theater</a>
<li> concerts at La Zona Rosa and Liberty Lunch
<li> two-stepping at the Continental Club or the 311 club
<li> I could go on...
</ul>

<h2>Houston, TX</h2>
Houston has the best bars of any city I've ever been in.  No joke.
<ul>
<li> Cecil's
<li> Warren's
<li> The Tap Room
<li> The Boatyard
<li> Rudyard's
<li> The Gingerman
<li> Valhalla
<li> The Alehouse
<li> Lola's 
</ul>

Also check out the butterfly exhibit at the Natural Sciences Museum.
Very very cool. <br>

Well, I'm a first year grad student, so I don't get out much.

else put together.<p>
