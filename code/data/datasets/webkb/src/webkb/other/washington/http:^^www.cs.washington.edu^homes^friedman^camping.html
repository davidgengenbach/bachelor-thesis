<H1> Marc's Camping Checklists </H1>

Going camping?  Can't remember every last little item?  It's no
problem with these checklists!

<ul>
 <li> <!WA0><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/friedman/camping/backcountry_camping"> Backcountry camping </a> 
 <li> <!WA1><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/friedman/camping/car_camping"> Car camping </a> 
 <li> <!WA2><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/friedman/camping/bike_camping"> Bike camping </a> 
</ul><p>

These lists roughly reflect what I bring when I go camping.  They are
not intended to be definitive.  They do not include technical
equipment that you would need when telemarking, snowshoeing, or
climbing.

<p>Always go camping with someone who knows what they're
doing.  Knowing what to bring is not a substitute for knowing what
you're doing.
