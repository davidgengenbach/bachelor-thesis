<H2>Documents discussing the Wide Area Information Server</H2>

Here are a few documents of interest on the Wide Area Information
Server (WAIS).  There are more where these came from, although not as
interesting (unless you like protocol specs and such).  Send <!WA0><!WA0><A
HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker"> me </A> mail if
you're interested in them.

<!WA1><!WA1><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/ai/590i/wais/wais-corporate-paper.txt"> WAIS Corporate Paper</A> 
is an executive summary of the system which, interestingly enough, was
designed for use by executives.  It isn't very long, and probably the
best bang for the buck in terms of time.

<!WA2><!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/ai/590i/wais/wais-concepts.txt"> WAIS Concepts</A> 
is a much longer paper in which many of the
ideas for using WAIS are discussed, such as information marketplaces,
dynamic folders, and personal newspapers.  It is interesting if you
have the time and want to discover what grand schemes the designers of
WAIS had when designing the system.

<!WA3><!WA3><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/ai/590i/wais/RD.Comparison.ps"> Resource Discovery Comparison</A> 
is an excellent paper comparing the various internet resource
discovery systems (dated 92) by, among others, Schwartz and Neuman.
If you want to find out how Archie, WAIS, Gopher, WWW, NetFind, WHOIS,
etc., all relate to each other, this is the paper for you.

<!WA4><!WA4><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/ai/590i/wais/cm-servers.ps"> CM Servers</A> 
is a paper describing a WAIS server on a CM-2 (a.k.a. searching 8192
Gigabytes in 12 seconds).  For those who like big parallel machines and
big numbers.
