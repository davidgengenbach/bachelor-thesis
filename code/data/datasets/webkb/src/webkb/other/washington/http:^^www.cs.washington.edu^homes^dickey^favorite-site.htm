My favorite Internet service not a Web site. It's a mailing list
called &quot;Wordaday.&quot;  The author is named Anu Garg. I
really know nothing about him, but over time, bits and pieces
of his history and character can be gleaned from his work.<BR>
<P>
What is Wordaday? Instead of answering, let me suggest you just
give yourself a surprise: subscribe and find out. You can always
unsubscribe if you don't like it. Here are the instructions, taken
verbatim from a Wordaday message:<BR>
<P>
<I>To subscribe or unsubscribe, please send a message to wsmith@wordsmith.org
with &quot;Subject:&quot; line as &quot;subscribe &lt;Your Real
Name&gt;&quot; or &quot;unsubscribe&quot;. Archives, FAQ, words
and more at the WWW site: http://www.wordsmith.org/awad/ <BR>
