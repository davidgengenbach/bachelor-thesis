<P>If you find bugs, design flaws or have other problems, first review
the list of common problems below. If this does not answer your question,
please send mail to <!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><A HREF="mailto:problems@metacrawler.com">problems@metacrawler.com</A>,
including a description of the browser and the operating system under which
the problem occurred.

<!--
<P>Unfortunately, we have not yet written any documentation for the new

<H2>Common Problems</H2>
-->

<P>Here is a list of &quot;known issues&quot; experienced by users of this
MetaCrawler release.

<H4>When I use Java status displays, I don't get any results</H4>

<P>To search with Java you must be using a Java enabled browser. This
includes Netscape 2.0 or newer and Internet Explorer 3.0 or newer. In addition,
make sure that Java support is turned on.

<H4>Internet Explorer 3.0 dies horribly</H4>

<P>This problem occurs if you are using Internet Explorer 3.0 on Windows
95 or Windows NT and the browser crashes with the message <I>&quot;This
program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.&quot;</I>.
Look for a message mentioning a fault in &quot;JIT.DLL&quot; under the
<I>Details</I> section of the window. This is a bug in IE 3.0's just-in-time
compilation routines for Java. The bug has been fixed as of version
3.01, so upgrading to this or a later version should solve the problem.

<P>If you do not wish to download a IE again, there is a workaround for
this problem: disable the just-in-time compiler. Go to the <I>View</I>
menu, select <I>Options...</I>, and click on the <I>Advanced</I> tab. Make
sure the selection box marked <I>Enable Java JIT compiler </I>is disabled,
and then click OK. Upon restarting the browser, the Java Beta application
should work correctly.

<H4>Gee, what a horrible color scheme you have chosen</H4>

<P>While color schemes are a matter of taste, certain popular browsers
have horrible palette bugs that become very troublesome when Java and frames
are both in use. We have chosen minimalistic color schemes on
some of our pages to reduce this effect, but it may still cause strange
output periodically.

<H4>How can I make my browser return to the previous list position when
I click &quot;back&quot; after following a link?</H4>

<P>Another buglet in the previously mentioned browser causes the list frame to
lose its place on some platforms. The problem has to do
with the use of frames; the configuration option to turn off frames is
the only known fix.
