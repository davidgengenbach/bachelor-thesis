<h2>Dive Computers and Diving Simulations</h2>
<p>
Several years ago, I wrote a dive computer that can simulate a variety
of exponential models used in current dive computers. It graphically 
displays the saturation of model compartments, and calculates
time-to-decompress and decompression-ceiling, as well as individual
ceilings for each compartment. Here's the <!WA0><!WA0><a

code</a> for my dive computer, diver. It requires an X-capable
graphics terminal. 

<h2>Personal History</h2>
<p>
I have done most of my ~60 dives in <!WA1><!WA1><a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/egs/turk/turk.html">Turkey</a>, around Datca, Kalkan and Kas. I
worked for three weeks as a dive guide in Datca when I was on vacation
there. If you have questions about diving in Turkey, feel free to send
me <!WA2><!WA2><a href="mailto:egs@cs.washington.edu">email.</a>

<p>
Lately, I have been snorkeling and free-diving instead of using
scuba. When snorkeling, I enjoy going deep. With scuba, I really enjoy
solo night dives as a form of meditation. Most of the time, though, I
dive with friends and follow more conservative profiles.
