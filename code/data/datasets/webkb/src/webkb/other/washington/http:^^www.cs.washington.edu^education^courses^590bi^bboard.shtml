1. We have created a mail distribution list cse590bi@cs.washington.edu from
the electronic addresses you supplied in the first week.  This can be used
for announcements, discussion outside of class, etc.

2. As Dick mentioned, we very much want to encourage you to sign up for credit
if at all possible.  To accomodate this, we have changed to variable credit
(anywhere between 1 and 3), with the following scheme:

a. 1 credit for attending faithfully and serving as notetaker when it is your
turn,

b. 1 credit for homework plus the take-home final, if there is one,

c. 1-2 credits for the project, depending on its magnitude, 

up to a maximum of 3 credits.  Please choose your level of involvement and
sign up for the appropriate number of credits.  Monday is the last day to make
such changes without penalty, I believe.  Signing up for credits is good for
the department and, if you're anything like me when it comes to good
intentions, good for the student as well.  

If you have questions about the credits or would like to discuss your plan for
the course, feel free to talk with any of us.  If (or when) you are
signed up for credit, please also send mail to Tompa saying how you intend to
satisfy the number of credits you chose, so that we know who are the
notetakers, who is doing a project, etc.

Thanks for the great pointers.  Would it be o.k. for either you or me to send

Subject: Algorithms notes

Martin,
	I just wanted to alert the class to a couple of topical books.

1) Calculating the Secrets of Life
   Lander and Waterman, eds.
   1995
   National academy Press

	This has several good chapters, including one on yesterday and 
tomorrow's lectures by Gene Myers.  At the end of this chapter, Gene 
states that the lowest bound on comparing two sequences yet found is 
O(NlogN), which addresses a question raised at the end of class 
yesterday.  He claims that the fastest algorithm to date is O(N^2/log^2N) 
(Masek and Paterson, 1980), leaving a gap between the fastest algorithm 
and the highest lowest theoretical bound for algorithms, and thus an 
open problem.
	Other good chapters include one on statistical significance of 
comparisons by Waterman, probabilistic gene mapping by Lander, and 
molecular clock rates by Tavare.  The book also includes four chapters on 
conformational computation.
	The UW library's copy is checked out by me and currently has a 
hold on it by someone else.  The bookstore should have one or more copies.

2) Introduction to Computational Biology
   Waterman
   1995
   Chapman and Hall

	This book just came out.  I ordered my copy through the bookstore 
and it took many weeks for it to arrive.  I haven't had a chance to read 
it yet, but it covers many of the above areas.  It is about 50% on mapping, 
30% on sequence alignment and assembly, and has a chapter on RNA 
secondary structure and one on tree assembly.
	It has a 50 page chapter on the dynamic programming of yesterday 
and tomorrow's lectures.

My instructions led you down a slightly wrong path on problem 3.  You should
assume that n is a power of 2, rather than one more than a power of 2, for
simplicity.  A small bonus is that it means you can ignore all the ceiling
notation in the problem.  A big bonus is that it means you won't have the same
misconception about how the algorithm works that I had until a few minutes ago.

Sorry for misleading you.

  &gt; TITLE:		Genome Rearrangements, or, What Dobzhansky and Sturtevant 
  &gt; 		Did Not Tell Us		
  &gt; 
  &gt; ABSTRACT:
  &gt; 
  &gt; Sequence comparison in computational molecular biology is a powerful tool 
  &gt; for deriving evolutionary or functional relationships between genes. 
  &gt; However, classical alignment algorithms handle only local mutations (i.e. 
  &gt; insertions, deletions and substitutions of one nucleotide) and ignore 
  &gt; global rearrangements (i.e.  inversions and transpositions of long 
  &gt; fragments).  As a result, the applications of sequence alignment to 
  &gt; analyze highly rearranged genomes (i.e. herpes viruses or plant 
  &gt; mitochondrial DNA) are very limited. I address the problem of  GENOME  
  &gt; comparison versus classical GENE comparison and present algorithms to 
  &gt; analyse rearrangements in genomes evolving by inversions, transpositions 
  &gt; and translocations. In the simplest form the problem corresponds to  
  &gt; sorting by reversals,  i.e.  sorting of an array using reversals  of 
  &gt; arbitrary fragments. I present polynomial algorithms and duality theorems 
  &gt; for sorting by reversals and genomic distance problem. I also discuss 
  &gt; applications of the  proposed techniques to analyze evolution of herpes 
  &gt; viruses, plant mitochondrial DNA and mammalian chromosomes. 
  &gt; 
  &gt; This is a joint work with Vineet Bafna (DIMACS), Colombe Chappey (NIH), 
  &gt; Sridhar Hannenhalli (USC), and Eugene Koonin (NIH).

  &gt; Spliced Alignment: a New (and Naive) Approach to Gene Recognition
  &gt; 
  &gt; Previous attempts to solve gene recognition problem were based on 
  &gt; statistics and artificial intelligence and, surprisingly enough, 
  &gt; applications of theoretical computer science methods for gene recognition 
  &gt; were almost  unexplored.  Recent advances in large-scale cDNA sequencing 
  &gt; open a way towards a new combinatorial approach to gene recognition.  I  
  &gt; describe a spliced alignment  algorithm  and a software tool which 
  &gt; explores all possible exon assemblies in polynomial time and finds the 
  &gt; multi-exon structure with the best fit to a related protein. Unlike other 
  &gt; existing methods, the algorithm successfully performs exons assemblies 
  &gt; even in the case of short exons or exons with unusual codon usage; we 
  &gt; also report correct assemblies for genes with more than 10 exons provided 
  &gt; a homologous protein is already known. On a test sample of human genes 
  &gt; with known mammalian relatives the average overlap between the predicted 
  &gt; and the actual genes was 99\%, which is remarkably well as compared to 
  &gt; other existing methods. At that, the algorithm absolutely correctly 
  &gt; reconstructed 87\% of genes. The rare discrepancies between the predicted 
  &gt; and real exon-intron structues were restricted either to extremely short 
  &gt; initial or terminal exons (less than 5 amino acids) or proved to be 
  &gt; results of alternative splicing. Moreover, the algorithm performs 
  &gt; reasonably well with non-vertebrate and even prokaryote targets. The main 
  &gt; result of the paper is that a relatively simple algorithm based on 
  &gt; combinatorial common sense and some biological intuition can outperform 
  &gt; many approaches developed for gene recognition in the last fifteen years.
  &gt; 
  &gt; This is a joint work with M.Gelfand and A.Mironov.

Date: Fri, 09 Feb 1996 10:44:24 PST
From: <b>Martin Tompa &lt;tompa@geoduck.cs.washington.edu&gt;</b>
</a>


Here are a few project ideas for CSE 590BI, to get you thinking about them. 
If you are doing a project and have your own ideas about what you would like
to do, please come talk with us about them.

If anyone else on this mailing list has interesting suggestions for course
projects, please send them to us.

CLASSIFICATION OF PROSTATE CANCER TUMORS

This project is related to research in  Lee Hood's laboratory on the 
classification of prostate cancer tumors. It is believed that a disease
category such as prostate cancer or ovarian cancer includes a number of 
distinct disease types that may require very different kinds of medical 
treatment. Some prostate cancers develop so slowly that they present no 
threat to mortality, while others require immediate medical intervention.
The existing diagnostic tests do not distinguish the different variants of 
the disease. Molecular biology may provide new experimental techniques that 
will distinguish the different types of prostate cancer or ovarian cancer. It 
is now possible to extract the mRNA from a tumor and transcribe it back to 
cDNA. By hybridizing the mix of cDNAs from a tumor against a large number of
genes from normal tissue and measuring the amounts of hybridization product
produced, one obtains a profile of the gene expression taking place in the 
tumor. Experiments are now getting under way which will use this hybridization
technique to obtain 25,000 measurements of gene expression in each of
600 prostate cancer tumors, and data will be available by late March. These
experiments will provide much more detailed &quot;fingerprints&quot; of tumors than has
been available up to now.

The computational challenge is to use this large body of data to classify the 
tumors into clusters and, based on this classification, to determine rules
that can be used to classify tumors in the future. One special feature 
of the problem is the high dimensionality of the data; i.e., the large number 
of measurements for each tumor. It is likely that only a small subset of these 
measurements will be important for the clasification, but we cannot know in 
advance which ones these will be.  The project will consist of looking 
into the literature of clustering and classification to discover appropriate 
computational methods and software packages, as well as devising special 
methods suited to this particular problem. Since real data will not be 
available by the end of the quarter, it may be desirable to test out different
methods on simulated data.   

MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT

There are a few different ideas for projects concerned with multiple
sequence alignment, as introduced in Lecture 6 and Homework 1.  The
general issues to explore are the various methods of valuation of
alignments (sum-of-pairs, consensus, Steiner, phylogenetic tree), and
efficient algorithms for achieving good alignments under any of these
valuation schemes.  

Because no one knows efficient algorithms for optimal alignments under
any of these valuation schemes, the project could explore ideas for
heuristics or approximation algorithms.  Dick Karp has a divide and
conquer heuristic that he would be interested in sharing.  There is a
minimum spanning tree heuristic hinted at in problem 10 of Homework 1,
and more details of what is done in practice are available in
Gusfield's manuscript and other sources.

Exploring such heuristics could be done experimentally, or
analytically.  Data for experimentation might come from exisiting
databases containing multiple aligned sequences, or could be generated
synthetically. 

cDNA MATCHING

Another project to explore is introduced in problem 4 of Homework 1:
For the cDNA matching problem, experiment with realistic gap penalties
reflecting what is known about intron lengths.

We are considering holding a less formal sequel to CSE 590BI next quarter, to
explore some of the many topics that we couldn't get into deeply enough this
quarter.  The format is very much up in the air: it might meet only once a
week, might consist largely of student presentations, etc.

This message is to see how much interest there is in the audience (both
student and faculty) for such a sequel.  If you are interested in continuing
next quarter, please send me information such as

1. interested in 1 day per week or 2?
2. any topics you would be particularly interested in exploring?
3. ideas on format?

                               NEW COURSE

                          Spring Quarter, 1996
            under the Topics in Genetics number (GENET 554)

                             Joe Felsenstein

                     of the Department of Genetics
                    will teach a 3-credit course in

                         Phylogenetic Inference

            at 11:30-12:20 MWF in room J280 Health Sciences Building

This course will cover, at the graduate level, the biology, statistics, and
computation of estimating phylogenies (evolutionary trees), inferring how much
uncertainty we have about the estimates, and making use of phylogenies in other
kinds of inferences.

Prerequisite is enough background in biology to know what DNA is, enough
statistics to know what likelihood is, and enough mathematics to be able to
understand what a matrix is.

Topics covered will include:

         What is a phylogeny?        restriction sites and RAPDs
         Parsimony methods           gene frequencies
         Compatibility methods       morphology and quantitative characters
         Distance matrix methods     comparative methods
         Likelihood methods          coalescent trees of genes
         Searching tree space        consensus trees and tree distances
         nucleotide sequences        tests based on tree shape
         proteins

There will also be computer exercises.

Subject: <b>CSE 590BI continues...</b>
</a>

We are planning to run a somewhat more informal continuation of CSE
590BI (Computation, Molecular Biology, etc.)  during Spring quarter.
We hope to revisit in more depth some topics introduced last quarter
(e.g. perhaps sequence assembly, MCD mapping), as well as explore
some new ones (perhaps protein folding, biomolecular computing,
genome rearrangement).  The topic list is not finalized; feel free
to send suggestions if you have particular interests.

Time:    Thursdays, 12:00-1:30 (starting next week, 3/28) 
         Note it's just one day per week.  
Place:   MEB 238
Grading: Credit/No Credit
Units:   Variable (1-3).  1 unit will again entail light housework,
         at worst.  2 or 3 units for more substantive involvement,
	 e.g., reading and presenting paper(s); negotiable.  
         (I don't have the SLN yet; it should appear in the official
	 time schedule tomorrow.)

</a>

We suspect that many people who would be interested in the
continuation of our computational bio seminar will also be
interested in David Baker's seminar on protein structure prediction.
Unfortunately there's a time conflict, and rescheduling our class is
difficult at this late date.  However, Baker's course only runs 4.5
weeks, so what we've decided to do is delay starting ours until 
*** Thursday, April 25 ***, continuing on the 5 subsequent
Thursday's.  This should avoid the conflicts.  So, until 4/25,
you're encouraged to go to Baker's seminar if interested, and to
join us for CSE590bi in MEB 238, 12:00-1:20 Thursdays, starting
4/25.  We'll work  out and distribute a schedule of topics in
advance of that.

Please contact Karp, Tompa, or me if you have questions about
registration, credits, or other administrative or substantive
issues.

Here's a repeat of Baker's announcement.  Note the room has been
changed to K-450, not J-something as reported below.

Historical Note:

    The University of Pennsylvania Training Program in Computational 
Biology, DIMACS, and IRCS are pleased to jointly host this conference on 
computational biology as part of the ENIAC Symposium.  This conference 
will be one of the activities in the Commemorative, Technical and 
Historical Symposium on the occasion of 50th anniversary of the Moore 
School Lectures.  These Lectures were held during the summer of 1946 
to bring together the leading specialists in high-speed digital 
computation in order to lay the foundations of the yet-to-be-defined 
fields of computer engineering and computer science.  With this 
symposium, we again hope to assemble researchers in current computer
science disciplines to advance the state of the field.  On this 
occasion we also invite historians of technology and computing, in 
order to understand the past so that we may proceed more knowingly 
into the future.

conflict we had last week.  So, for this week and next (at least),
we will meet in 
    
===&gt;  MEB 134, 12:00-1:20 Thursday 5/9 and 5/16 &lt;=== 

This week Tao Jiang will talk about a multiple tree alignment
problem.

To: cse590bi
Subject: <b>CSE590bi May 9 lecture</b>
</a>

In this lecture I will give a brief survey of recent approximation
algorithms for multiple sequence alignment with guaranteed error bound.
Two popular scoring schemes are considered: tree score and sum-of-pairs
score. The latter model was also discussed in the last quarter.
The emphasis will be given to various algorithm design techniques and
some simple analyses will be sketched.

  &gt; 
  &gt; David Haussler, from the Computer Science Department at University of
  &gt; California Santa Cruz, will be visiting the Center for Molecular
  &gt; Biotechnology Tuesday June 4 and will be presenting a lecture:
  &gt; 
  &gt; Using Hidden Markov Models for Biosequence Analysis
  &gt; (abstract at end of email)
  &gt; 
  &gt; Dr. Haussler received Ph.D. in computer science in 1982 from
  &gt; U. Colorado at Boulder.  He is a Fellow of the American Association for
  &gt; Artificial Intelligence, Associate Editor of Machine Learning,
  &gt; first chairman of the steering committee for the annual ACM Conference
  &gt; on Computational Learning Theory. His current research interests include
  &gt; computational biosequence analysis, machine learning, statistics and
  &gt; information theory.
  &gt; 
  &gt; If you would be interested in meeting with Dr. Haussler, please let me know.
  &gt; 
  &gt; Abstract:
  &gt; 
  &gt; With the databases of DNA, RNA and protein sequences growing
  &gt; at an explosive rate, the need for effective computational methods for
  &gt; biosequence analysis has become acute. In particular, we need
  &gt; good methods for locating genes in DNA sequences,
  &gt; along with their splice sites and regulatory binding sites,
  &gt; and good methods for making an initial classification of new proteins
  &gt; that detect weak homologies to other previously known proteins
  &gt; and predict possible functions for new proteins.
  &gt; Tools available for this analysis range from simple and general search
  &gt; methods such as BLAST to detailed protein folding models of
  &gt; the type used in protein threading and {\em ab initio} protein structure
  &gt; prediction. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) lie somewhere in the middle
  &gt; of this spectrum. They are computationally efficient enough
  &gt; for use with large databases, yet flexible enough to be used in
  &gt; constructing specific, detailed statistical models of the sequence variation
  &gt; within a particular protein family, our within a family of related
  &gt; DNA binding sites. We will describe what HMMs are and how
  &gt; they are used in biosequence analysis. Then we will briefly
  &gt; discuss some new work in our lab to make these models more biologically
  &gt; accurate.

</a>

No class this week.  

Next week Phil will do a bit more on sequence assembly, then I will
describe some approaches to &quot;biomolecular computation&quot;, e.g. the
work of Adleman, using DNA technology to solve an NP-complete
problem.

Subject: <b>tomorrow's seminar</b>
</a>


Tomorrow (30 May), Omid and I will talk about our recent work with
Dick to analyse large scale hybridization filters.  The data comes
from a new robotic system developed at MBT to determine hybridization
levels of a tissue sample against a large array of cDNA probes.  We will
present an overview of the process and discuss our efforts to
solve some new data-analysis problems which arise.  One such problem
is determining important cDNAs whose expression levels are effective
in predicting whether an unkown tissue sample is cancerous or not.

</a>


As most of you already know from the message I sent out earlier, I will be
offering a course on Genome Sequence Analysis this Fall (rough outline
below). Based on the initial response, it looks as though the best meeting
times would be Tu-Th 12:00 - 1:20. Please let me know if you are
interested in the course but would be unable to attend at that time
(unfortunately though there aren't many alternative times that wouldn't
cause problems for somebody).
 I'll be sending out an announcement later with the official course number
and additional details.

Phil




Genome Sequence Analysis: Outline

(The course is intended to be reasonably self-contained in the
sense that relatively little biological or computational background will
be assumed. There will be some overlap with the course CSE 590BI offered
last winter, but I will be covering a more limited number of topics, in
substantially greater depth. In particular there will be much heavier
emphasis on the relevant biology, on statistical issues, and on pragmatic
issues (e.g. use of current computer programs).)

I. Biological background: basic concepts of molecular biology;
genes and genomes; sequence evolution.

II. Sequence interpretation.
 a. Finding protein and DNA sequence similarities.  Pairwise sequence
comparison algorithms:  Smith-Waterman, BLAST, FASTA.  Statistics of
sequence comparison and database searches: likelihood ratios,
Karlin-Altschul theory, empirical methods. Low-complexity sequences.
Optimal score matrices &amp; gap penalties.  Profiles, &quot;motifs&quot;. Multiple
comparison methods: Gibbs sampler, Hidden Markov Models.
 b. Finding genes. Detection of coding regions, codon biases.
Detection of splice sites, weight matrices.
 c. Finding repeats.
 d. Finding regulatory sites and other subtle sequence features.

III. Sequence assembly. Shotgun sequencing strategies; assembly
algorithms;  assessment of data quality; statistics of sequence accuracy.

Phil,

I have set up your Special Topics Class (Sequence Analysis) for AU 1996.
Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12:00-1:20 in HSB T-473. The capacity for the
room is 50 people.

599 is MBT's general special topics course. Since 599A is Research Methods
and 599B is Research Discussions your course will fall under the 599C
section.I have also requested entry codes and a schedule line number as we
do with the other 599 sections.

Let me know if there is anything else!

Anne
