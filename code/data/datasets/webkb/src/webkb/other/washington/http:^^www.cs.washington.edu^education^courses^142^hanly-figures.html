<h1>CSE/ENGR 142: Computer Programming I</h1>
<h1>Textbook Code</h1>

The sample C code appearing in most of the figures in the textbook
  <cite>Problem Solving and Program Design in C</cite>,
  second edition,
  by Jeri R. Hanly and Elliot B. Koffman
  (c. 1996, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company)
are contained in the files 
 <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/cse142/hanly-2e-figures">here</a>.
<p>
Each figure is in a separate file, and each chapter's files are in a
separate directory.  
Note that most of these files are not pure C code, but also contain
other information such as sample input/output from the program.
This should be edited- or commented out before running the samples.
