    <h1> The Collaborative Spanish-English Dictionary </h1>
      
      <h4> Description. </h4>

      The Collaborative Spanish-English Dictionary looks up Spanish
      words for you electronically.  If you use the Wordbot, it does
      it by clicking on the word.

      <h4> Help! </h4>

      The Dictionary desparately needs a free electronic dictionary to
      use as its starting point.  Right now, the Dictionary is based
      on a 1200-word piece of junk, and is useless until we get a
      larger one.  If you know of one, contact
      <!WA0><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/friedman">
	Marc Friedman </a> at <!WA1><a

      <h4> Disclaimers.</h4>
      
      The dictionary is provided free of charge, with no promises about 
      quality.  Actually, I do make one promise about quality--the quality
      of the underlying wordlist sucks!

      <h4> Help collaborate! </h4>

      When I've finished writing the interface, you will be able to
      correct definitions and conjugations, as well as add new words.

      <h4> Features. </h4>

      The dictionary can deduce forms from stems of verbs, nouns, and
      adjectives.  At first, it tries to deduce the various stems of a
      verb from the infinitive as though they were regular.  It does
      final-consonant changes (coger, averiguar) correctly.  It will
      be wrong at first for stem-changing verbs, until the correct
      stems are entered.  Wildly irregular verbs and are not handled.

      <h4> Bug reports.</h4>
