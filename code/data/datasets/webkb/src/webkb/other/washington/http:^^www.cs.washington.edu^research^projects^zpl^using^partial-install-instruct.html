<h1>ZPL Compiler Partial Installation Instructions</h1>
<h5>(A ZPL Blurb)</h5>

<hr>

<p>This document describes the requirements and process for setting up a ZPL
compiler partial installation on a single processor UNIX syste,.  It is
assumed that you are familiar with the <!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/zpl/using/xxx.html">ZPL Compilation
Process</a>.  After you have completed the partial installation, you may
compile ZPL source codes using the <!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/zpl/using/using-zcr.html">Remote ZPL
Compiler</a> (<tt>zcr</tt>).</p>

<p>The partial installation requires less that half an hour and fewer
than 2 megabytes of disk space.  The resource economy comes from the
fact that the ZPL compiler itself is not included in the partial
installation.  Run-time libraries and configuration files are
included, but in order to actually compile a ZPL program, you use a
client stub to connect to the ZPL Net-Compiler server, which
compiles the program for you.  If you are not sure you want to invest
the effort, check out the <!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/zpl/web-compiler">Web-Compiler</a>
first.  </p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<h3>Hardware</h3>

<P>You may perform the partial installation on any UNIX machine. </P>

<P>The process by which you may perform the partial installation on parallel
machines will be described in another document (that does not yet exist). </P>

<h3>Software</h3>

<ul> <li>Basic UNIX utilities (e.g., sh, make, tar, perl, etc.)</li>
     <li>ANSI C compiler</li>
</ul>

<H2>Basics</H2>

<p>Recall the two steps to the <!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/zpl/using/xxx.html">ZPL compilation process</a>.
First, from a ZPL source program, a collection of C files are
generated.  Then, the C files are compiled and linked with machine
dependent and independent run-time libraries to produce an executable
program.  The partial installation primarily supports the second step.
The installation includes all the run-time libraries and configuration
files that select the appropriate compiler, compiler flags, etc.</p>

<h2>Partial Installation</h2>

<p>This section describes how to create a partial installation on your
hardware.  It is assumed that you are installing on a machine that is
currently supported (otherwise, you may want to consider undertaking the port;
see the <!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/zpl/using/xxx.html">Porting the ZPL System</a> document).  The
installation process involves creating the ZPL project directory hierarchy
(typically in <tt>/usr/local/zpl</tt>, though it can be anywhere).  This is
achieved in two steps: (1) FTP a tar file for, and
(2) compile and link the run-time libraries. </p>

<h3>Download files</h3>

<P>FTP the following compressed tar file. </P>

<ul>
  <li>Sequential UNIX workstation (<!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><a href="ftp://ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/orca/misc/home.seq.tar.Z">home.seq.tar.Z</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Uncompress and untar this file in the ZPL project directory
(e.g., <tt>/usr/local/zpl</tt>).  E.g.,</p>

<pre>
    zcat home.seq.tar.Z | tar -xvf -
</pre>

<h3>Compile the run-time libraries</h3>

<p>The first step in compiling the run-time libraries is to set the
<tt>ZPLTARGET</tt> environment variable to indicate that you want to compile
for a sequential UNIX workstation. </P>

<PRE>
    setenv ZPLTARGET seq
</PRE>


<p>To actually build the libraries, move into the directory where you
untarred the file and type the following.

<PRE>
    cd home/src
    zmake all
    cd seq
    zmake all
</PRE>

That's it.  You are all set to use the remote ZPL compiler. </P>

<P>See the <!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/zpl/using/using-zcr.html">Using the Remote ZPL Compiler</a> page
for an introduction to <tt>zcr</tt>.</p>
