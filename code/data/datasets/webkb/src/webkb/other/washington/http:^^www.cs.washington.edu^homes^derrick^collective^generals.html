<p>
<a href = "http:intercom/intercom.html"> Collective communications </a>
are routines that require greater than two processors
to communicate in order to carry out some global operation on distributed
data.  This is in contrast to a point-to-point operation such as a simple
send/receive or data exchange.  These operations include broadcast, reduction,
scatter/gather, combine, scan (or parallel prefix). 
<p>
These operations can be found in 
<a href="http:./explicit.html"> explicitly written parallel applications</a>,
<a href="http:./remap.html"> remapping of data</a>, 
<a href="http:./update.html"> updating of globals in a distributed 
memory environment</a>,

particular interconnection</a>.
