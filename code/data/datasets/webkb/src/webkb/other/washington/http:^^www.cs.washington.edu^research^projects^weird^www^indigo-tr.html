<H3>Abstract</H3>

Inequality constraints are useful for specifying various aspects of user
interfaces, such as constraints that one window is to the left of another,
or that an object is contained within a rectangle.  However, current local
propagation constraint solvers can't handle inequality constraints.  We
present Indigo, an efficient local propagation algorithm for satisfying
acyclic constraint hierarchies, including inequality constraints.
