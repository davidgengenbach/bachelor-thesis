<hr> <p>
The <!WA3><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/lis/chaos/www/chip.gif"> Chaos Router chip </a> is a two-dimensional (mesh and torus)
chaotic router implemented designed CMOS.  There are two versions, designed in 1.2 micron and 0.8
micron CMOS.  The 1.2 micron version was fabricated in 1993 and consists of around
110,000 transistors on a 10mm x 10mm die.  
Here is a <!WA4><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/lis/chaos/www/chipphoto.gif"> photo </a> of the 1.2 micron version.  The 0.8 micron 
version was designed in 1994 as a revision of the first chip, but was not fabricated.
<p>
The chips are designed using a combination of standard cells and custom logic.
There are five input buffers, five output buffers, and five multiqueue slots,
each implemented with a 20-word by 16-bit fifo.  These are connected by two crossbars
in a single unit.  
<p>
The 1.2 micron chip was fabricated and operated (nearly) correctly up to speeds of 30 MHz, short
of its designed 66MHz operation.  The 0.8 micron version included a redesign of the channel logic and
fifos, as well as the clocking scheme.  This version operates at 170 MHz in simulations, but has
not been fabricated.
