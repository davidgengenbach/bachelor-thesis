<FONT SIZE=1> Sorry, Republican quotes for for Java-enabled browsers only.</FONT>
<param name=text1 value="Pat and I have the satisfaction that every dime that we've got is honestly ours. I should say this--that Pat doesn't have a mink coat. But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat. And I always tell her that she'd look good in anything. One other thing I probably should tell you, because if I don't they'll probably be saying this about me too, we did get something--a gift--after the election.... It was a little cocker-spaniel dog.... And our little girl--Tricia, the 6-year-old--named it Checkers. And you know the kids love that dog and I just want to say this right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we're going to keep it.  --- Richard Milhous Nixon">
<param name=text2 value="Was I scared floating around in a little yellow raft off the coast of an enemy-held island, setting a world record for paddling?  Of course I was.  What sustains you in times like that?  Well, you go back to fundamental values.  I thought about Mother and Dad and the strength I got from them-- and God and faith and the separation of Church and State.  --- George Herbert Walker Bush">
<param name=text3 value="Fear, anguish and despair are with us daily. Yet in our darkest hours, we have three things that help sustain us: Our faith in the God Almighty; The love and support of our families; The knowledge that on this earth there are still men like Ollie North....  --- Robert Owen">
<param name=text4 value="You can tell a lot about a fellow's character by his way of eating jellybeans.  --- Ronald Wilson Reagan">
