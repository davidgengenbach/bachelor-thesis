<p>
Herein are preserved some interesting quotations.  You may consider
them to be indicative of my state of mind when I was foolish enough to
spend time typing them in.  Scary, isn't it?

<DT><i>A Usenet wag, on traditional Scottish food</i>
<DD><p>
A sheep is homeomorphic to a torus.  Apply a mapping such that the
interior and the exterior of the sheep are exchanged.  The result is
called a haggis.
</p>

<DT><i>The Tick</i>
<DD><p>
Villains, I say to you now: knock off all that evil!
</p>

<DT><i>Antoine de St. Exup&eacute;ry, "Le Petit Prince"</i>
<DD><p>
Les grandes personnes sont d&eacute;cid&eacute;ment bien bizarres,
se dit le petit prince.
</p>

<DT><i>System administrator Bill Duetschler, to his significant other</i>
<DD><p>
I'm sorry. I may marry you and father your children, but I'm not
giving you my root password.
</p>

<DT><i>Vladimir Kabaidze, General Director of Ivanovo Machine Building 
       Works</i>
<DD><p>
I can't stand this proliferation of paperwork.  It's useless to fight
the forms.  You've got to kill the people producing them.
</p>

<DT><i>Seymour Cray (?), on virtual memory</i>
<DD><p>
Memory is like an orgasm - it's better if you don't have to fake it.
</p>

<DT><i>My mother, on the need for freedom of information online</i>
<DD><p>
Chicken soup electrons should be part of the public domain.
</p>

<DT><i>Herman Melville, on whaling</i>
<DD><p>
It may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact, that among
the people at large, the business of whaling is not accounted on a
level with what are called the liberal professions.
</p>

<DT><i>Jim Cantalupo, president of McDonald's International</i>
<DD><p>
We don't usually like to talk about market share because we're not
going to share anything.
