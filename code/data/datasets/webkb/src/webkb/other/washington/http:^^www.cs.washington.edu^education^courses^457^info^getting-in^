<h2>Getting into the class</h2>

If you are a <a
href="/education/computer-science/computer-science.html"> CS </a> or
<a href="/education/computer-engineering/computer-engineering.html">
CE </a> major, and you have satisfied the <a
href="../../about/syllabus/index.html#prereqs"> prerequisites</a>, then you should be
able to sign up for the course directly.<p>

Otherwise, if you have satisfied the prerequisites but are not
currently a CS or CE major, you may still try coming to the first
class.  If fewer than 42 people are signed up, we may be able to let
you in.  If 42 are signed up, you are welcome to keep coming to the
class on the hope that some students will drop out; several usually
do.
