<h1>CSE 143 Homework Assignments</h1>

 <P>

Assignments are generally handed out on
Monday and due in section on Tuesday (about two weeks later). <P>

You must hand in a hard copy (paper) of your code as well as a floppy
disk containing your files (including project/make files).  Each 
assignment should be in a single folder named "CSE143-HW<em>n</em>"
where <em>n</em> is the number of the homework (1-5). <P>

Homeworks are graded both on correctness of external behavior
<b>and</b> on clarity, organization, and documentation of the code.  Working but
ugly code is not acceptable! <P>

The first two programming assignments must be completed individually.
For specific later assignments, we may decide to allow you to work in
groups of in teams of two.  Stay tuned for additional information if
we decide to make this option available. <p>

Information on writing C++ programs you probably need for your
homework is available <A HREF="../comp-info/c++-info.html">here</A>. <P>
