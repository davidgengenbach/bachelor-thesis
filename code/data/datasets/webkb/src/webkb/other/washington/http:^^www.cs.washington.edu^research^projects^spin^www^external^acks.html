Friends of SPIN
</h1>
<br>

<p>
We've gotten an incredible amount of help from individuals and organizations.
This list is by no means exhaustive.
<dl>
<dt> <a href=http://www.arpa.mil/>ARPA</a>
<dd> A lot of our funding comes from ARPA.

<dt><a href=http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/home.html>Digital Equipment Corporation  Systems Research Center</a>
<dd> Equipment, our <a href=http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/modula-3/html/home.html>Modula-3</a> compiler, some of our device drivers, and 
our networking debugging protocol all come from DEC.   Most of this comes
through the generous efforts of <a href=http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/people/Dave_Redell/bio.html>Dave Redell</a> at DEC SRC.

<dt> <a href=http://www.dec.com/>Digital Equipment Corporation</a>, Nashua
<dd> Our DEC UNIX server and pieces of our Alpha-based Mach 3.0 kernel come
from work done by DEC and OSF.  Special thanks to Bob Picco at DEC for
his assistance here.

<dt><a href=http://riwww.osf.org:8001/>Open Software Foundation Research Institute</a>
<dd> Many pieces of our OSF/1 Unix server and our Alpha version of
Mach 3.0 come here or the sister institute in Grenoble.

<dt> <a href=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/FrontDoor.html>CMU</a>
<dd> We've borrowed 
pieces of our UNIX server, and some of our
device infrastructure from the <a href=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/mach/public/www/mach.html>CMU Mach project</a>.
Some of us used to work at CMU also.


<dt> <a href=http://www.ibm.com/>IBM</a>
<dd> IBM provides funding for some of us. In addition, IBM recently made
a sizable hardware <a href=../pics/gun-loucks.gif>donation</a> to our
department.

<dt> Intel
<dd> Intel has provided us with lots of equipment that we've used in this
project in one way or another.
