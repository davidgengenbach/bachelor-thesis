<h1>Using turnin</h1>
<hr>

<b>Executive Summary:</b> <i>This document contains information on
using turnin to submit homework assignments.</i>

<hr>

	We'll be using the 'turnin' program to support electronic submission of
programming assignments.  The student interface to turnin is straightforward. 
IMPORTANT: You can must run turnin on the mscc machines for the lisp
assignments; turnin on other machines (.u and .cs) will not submit your homeworks
to the expected destination. <P>

Suppose I've finished my problem set, and I'm ready to submit it. To turnin a set
of files, one types 'turnin file1 file2 ..... filen'.  Turnin will ask you which
class you are submitting the assignment for; answer cse341.  Here's a transcript
of what happens when I use turnin to submit the files prob1.cl, bank.cl, and
menus.lisp. <P>


<code>
turing_38% turnin bank.cl menus.lisp prob1.cl <p>

For this submission, you may enter the course information interactively.<br>
You are not subscribed to any valid course, here is a list of the courses<br>
you may use currently:<br>
          cse341           MS100          cse401          cse473<br>
Enter course name? [cse341] cse341<br>
Compressing submitted files... please wait<br>
Your files have been submitted to cse341, psl1 for grading.<br>
</code> <P>


	If you want to check and see which files you've actually submitted, you
can give turnin the -v option: <P>

<code>
turing_39% turnin -v  <P>

For this submission, you may enter the course information

          cse341           MS100          cse401          cse473<br>

rw-r--r-- 10107/117    3069 Apr  4 17:15 1996 bank.cl<br>
rw-r--r-- 10107/117    5119 Apr  4 14:51 1996 menus.lisp<br>
rw-r--r-- 10107/117    2022 Apr  4 13:45 1996 prob1.cl<br>

</code> <P>


	Turnin also takes a -c flag to specify the class.  You can
also use this interface.  For example: <P>

<code>
turing_40% turnin -c cse341 bank.cl menus.lisp prob1.cl <br>
Compressing submitted files... please wait<br>
Your files have been submitted to cse341, psl1 for grading.<br>
turing_41% turnin -c cse341 -v<br>
rw-r--r-- 10107/117    3069 Apr  4 17:15 1996 bank.cl<br>
rw-r--r-- 10107/117    5119 Apr  4 14:51 1996 menus.lisp<br>
rw-r--r-- 10107/117    2022 Apr  4 13:45 1996 prob1.cl<br>
</code>  <P>

	You can run turnin as many times as you want, each time the new
submission will completely replace the previous submission.  We will
use the time stamps of the submitted files to determine whether or not
a submission is late.   <P>
