<h1>Turnin Instructions for Final Project</h1>

For the final project, if you are writing a lisp program, please turn
it in as normal.  Note, that since the project is due on the day of
the final, I would like you to turn in a paper copy of the project as
well.  Whatever kind of project you do, I would like for you to hand
in the electronic version in the same general format.  At the begining
put your name.  Then instrcutions of how to run it (please be clear
and explicit).  IF it is appropriate, include smaple output.  All of
the previous things should be commented out wiht ';' if LISP, or with
/* */ if in C.  Then in the file, please include the program itself.<p>

If the sample output is too large to reasonably fit in the file with
the code, or if the program is in multiple file, you may submit a
folder (or a directory) if you wish.
In this case, please name the directory as you have named programs in
the past.  ie.<p>

<samp>
	~c415/submit.sh redstone.final.project
</samp><p>

or something that begins with your last name.  The submit program will
work for submitting directories.  As always, if you are submitting a
file with code mixed with non-code, please make it so I can execute
it.<p>



<h2>For Unix submissions</h2>

Please submit your file using a script in ~c415:<p>

<samp>
% ~c415/submit.sh redstone.final.cl<br>
File  redstone.final.cl  deposited in turnin folder.
</samp><p>

The turnin program only submits one item, and should not return any errors.
Please mail me if any occur.  It should only say file has been deposited if
there are no errors.<p>

<h2>Macintosh submissions</h2>

This is assuming you have 'mounted' the class folder.  Open up the
ClassFolder.  Inside you will see a folder called Dropfolder.  Simple
drag the file or folder you wish to submit to the DropFolder.<p>
