<h1> Experiment Management </h1>

<hr>

Experiment management consists of computer-based support that helps a
scientist to manage his scientific research work. Examples include
tools which help the scientist to document, test and execute
computer-based scientific experiments. We have designed a model in
which the scientist represents his experiments. Information about
the experiments is automatically recorded in the database as the
experiment executes and the user can query this information during
his analysis of the experiment's results.
