<h1> CSE 590I: Reviews of Web Sites</h1>

	<li> Here's some really good examples of what to do with Mosiac...

		<ul>
			<li> Nick provides some really <!WA0><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/nick/">useful services</A>.

<li> The <!WA1><a href="http://cadc.dao.nrc.ca/CADC-homepage.html"> Canadian
Astronomical Data Center</a> has a good home page.  They clearly
describe the organization's purpose, and provide access to programs
and data (presumably useful to astronomers).  (For laymen, they have
some nice GIFs from the repaired Hubble Space Telescope.)  Seems like
a good example of the Web actually being used for something... [review

			<li> Aaron describes a few <!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/pulkka/good-links.html">good WWW techniques</A>.
			<li> ...
		</ul>


	<p> <li> ... and here's some stuff that's pretty lame:

		<ul>

<li> The "clickable map" seems like a good idea, but it doesn't always
work out.  For an example of a failed effort, have a look at this
<!WA3><a href="http://www.ucs.ed.ac.uk/General/uk.html"> Map of the UK</a>
on a monochrome screen.  Good document designs shouldn't
<em>depend</em> on hardware (like a color display) that isn't
universally available. [review by mikew]
			<li> Aaron describes a few <!WA4><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/pulkka/bad-links.html">bad WWW techniques</A>.
			<li> ...
		</ul>

	<p> <li> ... and here are some reviews of web sites

		<ul>
			<li> Mike's <!WA5><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/map/reviews.html">reviews</a> of web sites, good and bad.
			<li> Franz's <!WA6><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/franz/reviews.html">ramblings</a> on some web documents.
			<li> Dylan <!WA7><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/dylan/reviews.html">mumbles</a> about some web sites and html.
			<li> Ying <!WA8><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/ysun/review.html">discusses</a> some good and bad examples on the web.
                	<li> Mike checks out <!WA9><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vanhilst/reviews.html"> technical tutorials</a> (once map gets fixed)
