I am now in search of a topic to pursue my PhD on.  For my
PhD. qualifier, I studied the problem of quickly finding approximately
matching clones in a restriction mapping experiment.  I came up with
an interesting algorithm to speed up the process and analyzed some of
the tradeoffs.  I think that the ideas behind the algorithm are
general enough to define a general scheme for approximate matching in
other contexts.  I was advised mainly by professor Larry <!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><a

, and also by professor <!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><a

Recenlty, professors Oren <!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/etzioni/">Etzioni</a>, Steve

Tao <!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/jiang">Jiang</a> and I began investigating a
fairly new problem: the <!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><a

problem!  We introduced a few optimization models and came up with
approximation algorithms under those models. <p>
