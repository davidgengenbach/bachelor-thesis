<h1>Wtutor</h1>

<p>
The World Wide Web is a rich source of material that can be used for 
educational purposes. Advantages of reusing these existing materials
are avoiding the 
duplicated effort of creating new versions of material that is already 
in existence, using up-to-date information, and letting the student see 
the original source materials. In addition this approach permits tutorial 
authors to focus on adding value by organizing, commenting on, and adding 
to existing information.
<p>
The World Wide Web provides a vast store of globally available information 
from a variety of sources. Government agencies such as the National 
Institute of Health, NASA, and the Smithsonian operate multiple Web 
servers that allow access to data, reports, art and analysis. Most 
universities and colleges have Internet access and these institutions, 
their departments, faculty, staff and students have set up 
Web servers to provide information about the schools and their research. 
Organizations such as CERN make specifications and proposals available via 
the Web. Businesses and individuals operate Web sites for self-promotional 
purposes or for love of a subject. All of these different resources can be 
used to find materials for inclusion in tutorials.
<p>
Using existing materials from the WWW for educational purposes presents 
a number of problems that must be dealt with. The first problem is the 
filtering problem: with all the material out there on the Web, how does 
the student know which materials are relevant to the chosen subject area? 
And of those relevant materials, which best present the subject at a 
level appropriate for the student? Once the set of appropriate materials 
has been selected the student is confronted with the navigation problem: 
given the set of appropriate materials, where should the student start? 
In what order should the student view those materials? When is the student 
finished?
<p>
Wtutor is a system that allows a tutorial author to create tutorials as 
trails through WWW documents and include assessment points along the trail. 
Wtutor monitors the student’s progress through a tutorial and provides
guidance to the student as well as feedback regarding the student’s 
performance on the assessment points.
<p>
There are four major components that make up the Wtutor environment: the 
Wtutor program, the Tmosaic program, a tutorial map and the World Wide Web.
Wtutor is an Allegro Common-Lisp program which runs on a Sun workstation. 
Wtutor interacts with Tmosaic and the tutorial map. 
<p>
Tmosaic is a modified version of NCSA Mosaic. Tmosaic provides the
interface to the World Wide Web; it is used to retrieve Web documents 
and display those documents to the student or tutorial author. A socket 
and corresponding message protocol were added to NCSA Mosaic so that
Wtutor could communicate with Tmosaic. Tmosaic notifies Wtutor of events 
such as retrieval of a URL, submission of a form, and student requests
such as <strong>Next URL</strong>. In turn, Wtutor can pass requests to
Tmosaic such as <strong>Load URL</strong>.
<p>
The tutorial map defines the tutorial to Wtutor.
Logically, the tutorial map is a directed graph, where the nodes of the
graph are URLs and assessment points and the edges of the graph are
precedence relationships between the nodes. Wtutor uses the map to guide 
the student through the tutorial. In the Wtutor environment, the primary 
role of the tutorial author is to create the tutorial map. The tutorial 
map identifies all the URLs within the tutorial, thereby eliminating the 
filtering problem for the tutorial student. Physically, the tutorial map 
is stored as a text file in Lisp syntax; Wtutor reads in the map at the 
student’s or author’s request.
<p>
While the tutorial map eliminates the filtering problem for the student, 
it does not solve the problem for the tutorial author. The author must 
still find or create URLs to include in the tutorial; for this task the 
author can use tools such as the MetaCrawler to find URLs that 
may be appropriate. The author must still evaluate the candidates to 
determine fitness for inclusion in the tutorial.
<p>
The tutorial map is created online by the author. The tutorial author 
can add or delete URLs from the tutorial map using Wtutor. The author 
can either specify a fully qualified URL, or retrieve the URL using 
Tmosaic and then specify that that URL should be added to the tutorial 
map. The author also specifies precedence information in the tutorial 
map. This precedence information is used by Wtutor to determine the 
sequence in which the URLs and assessment points of the tutorial should 
be viewed. To make it easier for the tutorial author to establish the 
precedence relations between the nodes of the tutorial map, a group 
feature is provided, so that the author can specify groups of URLs 
and then declare precedence between groups, between groups and individual
URLs, and between URLs and groups.
<p>
If desired, the author can require that certain URLs be displayed 
together; for example, a graphic image such as a map could be displayed 
along with a commentary that describes a historical trade route that 
can be found on the map. The author can also identify alternative URLs; 
that is, if URL A and URL B are alternatives, the student would not need 
to view B if the student had already viewed A.
<p>
Wtutor uses the information it receives from Tmosaic to track the 
student’s progress through the tutorial map. Whenever a URL is retrieved, 
Tmosaic sends messages to Wtutor specifying that the URL has been 
retrieved, and asking whether any of the links contained within the 
URL should be highlighted. Wtutor specifies that a link to a URL should 
be highlighted when the URL is included in the tutorial map and all 
precedence requirements for that URL have been met. The tutorial author 
can specify the highlight  color to be used. As the student proceeds 
through the tutorial, highlighted link displays will always indicate 
good next choices to visit.
<p>
If the student does not have a highlighted link on the currently 
displayed link, the student can have Wtutor select the next URL to visit. 
Tmosaic has a <strong>Tutor</strong> menu item, and one of the selections 
under the <strong>Tutor</strong> entry is a <strong>Next</strong> option. 
When the student selects the <strong>Next</strong> 
option, Wtutor finds a URL that is ready to visit. Wtutor follows a set 
of rules in searching for the next URL. The overriding rule is that the 
selected URL must have all it’s precedents completed. Wtutor looks first 
for a consequent of the current URL; if there are none that are acceptable 
then consequents of the previous URL visited are checked. If none of these 
are acceptable, Wtutor looks for URLs within the same group as the current 
node. Finally, Wtutor looks for any URL within the map whose precedence 
requirements have all been met. 
<p>
If all URLs within the tutorial map have been viewed, the student is 
notified that the tutorial has been completed. The student is given 
the option of starting a new tutorial.
