<h2>Murphy's Law (and corollaries)</h2>

<ol>
<li>THE PRIME AXIOM: Anything that can go wrong, will.
<li>If nothing can go wrong, something will.
  <ol>
  <li>If nothing is going wrong, you have overlooked something.
  </ol>
<li>If only one thing goes wrong, it will do maximum damage.
<li>Everything will go wrong at one time...
  <ol>
  <li>When you least expect it;
  <li>When it causes the most difficulty; and
  <li>After any warranty expires.
  </ol>
<li>Things always go from bad to worse.
<li>Mother Nature is...
  <ol>
  <li>Not indifferent to intelligence; she is actively hostile;
  <li>She always sides with the hidden flaw.
  </ol>
<li>Nothing is as easy as it looks; everything takes longer than
expected.
<li>Having found a solution to a problem after immense work, one
usually realizes that it or another was apparent from simple
inspection.
<li>Errors usually sum in the same direction.
<li>Fault cannot be properly placed, or credit properly given, if
more than one person is involved.
