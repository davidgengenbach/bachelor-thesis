History:

<p>
2/3/96 -- Added custom update method to make redrawing of the puzzle
iteself happen offscreen to get rid of occasional flicker.

<p>
2/2/96 -- The randomize button now works, and the Repeat Last button
currently puts the puzzle back in order.  That will change.

<p>
1/29/96 -- Note that although buttons now appear for the
aforementioned functions, they don't actually do anything yet.  Oh
well, at least I figured out Layouts.

<p>
1/25/96 -- First put up.  Much more is coming, including a randomize
button an a couple of AI search algorithms to automatically solve the puzzle.
