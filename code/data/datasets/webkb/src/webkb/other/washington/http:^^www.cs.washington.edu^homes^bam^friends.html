   Bug these people:<p>

<A HREF = "http://www.mindspring.com/~bec/"><IMG
align=left SRC="pix/bec.gif"></A> Despite
what you may gather from her Web page, I <blink> do </blink> admit to
knowing <A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~bec/">Becah Jubon</A>,
even if she did put up 150 fliers of me in drag on my birthday.  At
least she sent me a <A HREF="postcard.html">postcard</A> when my WAM
account died.<br clear=all><p>

<A HREF = "http://www.seester.com"><IMG align=left
SRC="pix/amie.gif"></A><A HREF = "http://www.seester.com">Amie
Beal</A>, her accomplice, has the moosiest crackers YOU'LL ever see.
She also has the honor of being the only person I know of besides Tori
Amos with her own domain name.<br clear=all><p>

<A HREF = "http://cmbr.phys.cmu.edu/~jody/"><IMG
align=left src="pix/jody_small.jpg"></A><A
HREF = "http://cmbr.phys.cmu.edu/~jody/">Jody Prival</A>, perhaps
best known for her cooking, her cat, and her hair.  May she never
try to combine her claims to fame.<br clear=all><p>

align=left SRC="pix/mike.gif"></A><A HREF =
"http://harlie.ee.cornell.edu/~mbw">Mike Wolfson</A> - the guy who's
responsible for the bowling pins and Barnies in my
life.<br clear=all><p>

Beth and <A HREF="http://pubweb.acns.nwu.edu/~jackal/den.html">
Carlos Villavicencio</A> - to count all the doctorate degrees in their
immediate family on one hand you'd need to have several fingers
surgically attached, which they'd be happy to do for a
reasonable fee.<br clear=all><p>

<A HREF =

SRC="pix/aleecia.gif"></A><A HREF =
"http://alycia.dementia.org/~am40/home.html">Aleecia McDonald</A> - I
used to think I was chaos incarnate.  Then I met her.  Ask her about
Weaselsoft sometime.<br clear=all><p>

SRC="pix/josh.gif"></A><A HREF =

another aerospace heathen.  They're everywhere!  (Then again, I am in
Boeing central...)<br clear=all><p>

<A HREF = "http://rever.nmsu.edu/~sasha"><IMG
align=left SRC = "pix/mary.gif"><A HREF =
"http://rever.nmsu.edu/~sasha">Mary Koster</A>, infamous for her
sporks and chain-mail underwear, although you won't see pictures of

SRC="pix/sherman.gif"></A><A HREF =
"http://www-leland.stanford.edu/~daedalus/">Sherman Lo</A> is an
active Asian absorbed with aikido, Aeronautics and Astronautics, and
... College Bowl.  (So much for the alliteration.)  He also does
exotic dances to Madonna songs if he's sufficiently
drunk.<br clear=all><p>

<A HREF="http://mercury.sfsu.edu/~aohair/"><IMG
align=left src="pix/unabomer.gif"></A><A
HREF="http://mercury.sfsu.edu/~aohair/">Amy O'Hair</A> - Okay, so she

like.<br clear=all><p>
