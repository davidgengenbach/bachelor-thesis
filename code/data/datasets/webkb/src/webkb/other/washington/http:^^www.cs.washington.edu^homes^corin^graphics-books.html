<h1>Computer Graphics Book Reviews</h1>

As an undergrad at the University of Washington, I came across several
text and reference books for computer graphics.  As time permits, I
will post reviews of these books here.  For now, the only book for
which I have a review is the first CG book I owned, <em>The C Graphics
Handbook</em>.  

<hr>
<em>The C Graphics Handbook</em> by Roger T. Stevens.<br>
ISBN 0-12-668320-4<br>
Academic Press, (c) 1992<p>

<!-- The book has a blue-greenish spine and dark green front cover -->
<!-- with randomly colored arcs.  There is a 5.25" disk included that -->
<!-- has source code. -->

I found this book one of the best reads in computer programming and
computer graphics.  This book came on vacation with me and I read it
cover to cover.  While it is true that the book is a little old (the
high-end SuperVGA cards discussed have long been displaced by much
higher performance cards) the basics are still quite valuable
(Bresenham's line drawing algorithm, etc.).<p>

The Table of Contents are:<p>

<ol>
  <li>Introduction
  <li>How Display Adapter Card Hardware works (monitor, EGA, VGA)
  <li>VGA/EGA Display Adapter Card Registers
  <li>Extended Registers for Super VGA Cards (pre-1992; see (c) date)
  <li>Using Display Modes
  <li>Plotting a Point on the Graphics Screen
  <li>Lines and Rectangles
  <li>Undocumented Display Modes:  How to Create and Use Them
  <li>Using Extended Super VGA Modes
  <li>EGA/VGA BIOS Functions
  <li>System and Display Coordinates and How They Interact
  <li>Clipping Techniques
  <li>Drawing and Filling Circles
  <li>Drawing and Filling Ellipses
  <li>Drawing and Filling Circular Arcs
  <li>Drawing and Fast Filling Polygons
  <li>Drawing and Filling Rounded Rectangles
  <li>Smooth Curves with Bezier and B-Spline Functions
  <li>Displaying Text in the Graphics Modes
  <li>Rotating Geometric Figures
  <li>The Mathematics of Modeling Solids
  <li>Solid Modeling Techniques
  <li>Solid Modelling with C++
  <li>Saving and Restoring Displays with the .PCX Format
  <li>Displaying .IMG Format Files
