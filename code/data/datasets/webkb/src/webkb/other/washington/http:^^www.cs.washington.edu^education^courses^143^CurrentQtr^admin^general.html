<h1>CSE 143 General Information</h1>

<hr>


<h3>Course Goals</h3>

This is a course about abstraction and programming.  Specifically, the
goals of CSE 143 are to learn the concepts of modularity and
encapsulation, focusing on abstract data types, and the basics of data
structures.  Other important topics include thinking and programming
recursively and analyzing the complexity of simple algorithms. <P>

After completing the course, students should be able to design and
write medium-sized programs, to design interfaces to modules and
abstract data types and provide one or more implementations of those
interfaces, and to read, write, use, and document software components. <P>

To make these concepts and abilities concrete, we will study and use
the C++ programming language.  But 143 is <B>not</B> a class on C++!
Most concepts taught in 143 can be applied in many languages, and
there are many C++ constructs and features that we will not be
covering.

<h3>Text</h3>
  <UL>
  <LI>Headington and Riley,
        <em>Data Abstractions and Structures using C++</em>, Heath, 1994.
  <LI>Strongly Recommended: Lippman,
	<em>C++ Primer (2nd Edition)</em>, Addison Wesley, 1993.
	<p>
	It really doesn't matter too much which C++ book you have, but
	you almost certainly will want one, since the text is not a
	reference manual in any sense of the word.
  </UL>
<P>


<h3>Evaluation</h3>
  <UL>
  <LI>There will be one midterm and a comprehensive
	final exam. Any material covered in the lectures, the
	sections, the homework assignments, and the assigned readings 
	is a fair game in the exams. Thus it is important to attend
	the sections as well as the lectures.
	<p>

  <LI>There will be 5 <!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><!WA19><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/143/CurrentQtr/homework/">programming
	assignments</A>. Be sure and read the <!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><!WA20><a href =
	"http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/143/CurrentQtr/admin/grading.html">grading</a> and <!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><a href =
	"http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/143/CurrentQtr/admin/turnin.html">turn-in</a> policies for these.<P>

  <LI>There will be about 6-7 <!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/143/CurrentQtr/quizzes/">quizzes</A>. <P>

  <LI><b>Grading</b><BR>The following breakdown will be used for 
	grading.
	<ul>
	<li> Midterm, 15%
	<li> Final, 35%
	<li> Weekly Quizzes, 10% total (about 1.5% for each quiz)
	<li> Assignments #1-#2, 5% each (10% total)
	<li> Assignments #3-#5, 10% each (30% total)
	</ul><p>

  <li><b>Extra Credit</b><br>
	To earn extra credit, you must first fully complete and submit each
	assignment as given.  If you are interested in extra credit,
	we may suggest some extensions or other related programs to
	write.  Extra credit is limited to a maximum of 5% of the total
	course grade.
	<p>

  <LI><b>Late Policy</b><BR>Except in truly exceptional
	circumstances, late homework will <b>NOT</b>
  	be accepted.  Homeworks are due <em>at the beginning</em>
	of section on the assigned days.
	<p>

  <li><b>Policy on Collaboration vs. Cheating</b><br>
        You may <B>not</B> copy code from someone else; that is
considered cheating.  If caught cheating in this or any other way,
full disciplinary measures may be invoked, including a failing grade
in the class and initiation of a cheating case in the university
system. <P>
        To avoid creating situations where copying can arise, you
cannot email or post or otherwise make your code available
electronically to anyone.  You can post general questions about
programming problems and even pseudo-code snippets, but no actual C++
code. <P>
    	Now for the good news.  It is educationally valuable to work
with others on general ideas for how to go about solving some problem,
helping others in general terms when they are getting stuck.  I will
allow people to look at others' code on screens to give them help in
debugging (because in this case only one or two people are seeing the
code, and they are not getting an electronic copy).  If in doubt about
collaboration vs. cheating, just don't.  Or send the instructor email

asking for clarification. <p>

<h3>Computing</h3>

This quarter we will be using the <!WA24><!WA24><!WA24><!WA24><!WA24><!WA24><!WA24><A
HREF="http://www.ms.washington.edu/">MSCC</A>'s Mac lab, located in
the basement of Thomson Hall.  This lab will be staffed with
consultants who will be able to provide you with reasonable levels of
help.  The Mac lab in Sieg 324 can also be used, but at low priority;
only when it is not being used by higher-priority classes can you use
it.

This course offers two levels of computing support: "full" and
"partial."  We will accept turnins (floppy disks) with projects
developed for either fully or partially supported platforms.
Additionally, full support means that we will build sample executables
for that platform, as well as an easy-to-unpack distribution of the
code necessary for getting started.

<p> 

Partial support means that we will not provide sample executables or
bundled code distributions.  We will make necessary sample/skeleton
source code available via the web. This code should be reasonably
portable, so you should be able to build projects on other platforms
without too much trouble.  Remember, if you choose to use a partially
supported platform, it is your responsibility to configure your system
and understand how to build projects there.  <b>We will not be able to
debug system configuration problems for you.</b>

<p>

Here is a summary of the platforms we support.  We will assign a 
TA or consultant to each platform to give help with reasonable problems.

<ul>
<li>Full: <!WA25><!WA25><!WA25><!WA25><!WA25><!WA25><!WA25><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/143/CurrentQtr/comp-info/platforms/symantec/">

</ul>

Using a machine of your own has many advantages, and a few
disadvantages.  Many students have done so in the past; we encourage
you to try it.  

<p>

(Note that we do not support Win '95 or NT compilers.  We expect that
source files developed under those systems for this class will compile
and execute on our test machine, but <b>ensuring</b> that they do is
your responsibility.)
