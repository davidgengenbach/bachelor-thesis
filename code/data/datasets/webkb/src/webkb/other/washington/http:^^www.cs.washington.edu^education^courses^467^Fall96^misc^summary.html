<h1>CSE467: Advanced Logic Design</h1>
<h3>Ted Kehl, Fall 1996 </h3>

<hr>

<b>Catalog Data</b>:  CSE467: Advanced Digital Design (3).  <br>
Advanced techniques in the design of digital systems.  Hardware 
description languages, combinational and sequential logic synthesis 
and optimization methods, partitioning, mapping to regular structures.  
Emphasis on reconfigurable logic as an implementation medium.  Memory 
system design.  Digital communication including serial/parallel and 
synchronous/asynchronous methods.  Prerequisites: CSE370 and CSE326.
<p>
<b>Course Goals</b>:
To provide in-depth understanding of digital systems and their 
design, from specification and simulation to construction 
and debugging.
<p>
<b>Enrollment</b>:
No auditing of the class will be permitted and only registered 
students may attend.  All students must have completed the 
prerequisite material (CSE326/CSE370).
<p>
<b>Textbook</b>:
Katz, <i>Contemporary Digital Design</i> (Benjamin/Cummings, 1994)
and supplementary notes to be distributed in class.  (A copy of
Katz is on reserve in the library.  I may have a copy you can borrow.)
Here is a list of <a href="reserve.html"><b>books on reserve.</b></a>
<p>
<b>Lecture Notes</b>: A set of lecture slides are available on the Ave
at Professional Copy 'N Print at 4200 University Way NE.  Although I
will not be teaching directly from these slides, I will be covering
this material and using most of the examples.  These notes are also
available on the Web in pdf format, but I strongly advise you to pick
up a printed copy so you can take notes on them in class.  (Please
don't try to print them out from the Web.)
<p>
<b>Assignments</b>:
There will be both written homework and laboratory exercises.
A lab project will dominate towards the end of the quarter.
<p>
<b>Collaborative Learning</b>:
It is well known that students can learn a lot from each other given
the chance.  During the first week I will assign everyone into teams
of three and four students.  You will have to work together to solve
some of the homework assignments and work on the labs.  Each member of
the team will be responsible for the performance of all other team
members; that is, the entire team must understand the solution and
contribute to part of it.  We will talk about this in more detail later.
<p>
<b>Quizzes and Exams</b>:
There will be a mid-term exam.  The final exam will be two-hour hours and
is scheduled for ????? from ??????.  Quizzes and the final exam will
be open book and open notes.
<p>
<b>Grading</b>:
The course grade will be roughly determined as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Assignments (homework and laboratory): 50%
  <li>Final Exam: 35%
  <li>Participation and intangibles: 10%
</ul>
I grade on the curve.
<p>
<b>Cheating Policy</b>:
You will need to work with your team to be able to complete homework
and lab assignments.  Each team will record what each team member did
and which ideas they contributed.  There will be no collaboration on
quizzes and exams.
