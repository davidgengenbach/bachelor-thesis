<h1>CSE 500/490B: Computers and Society -- Assignment 1</h1>

Due: Tuesday Jan 30.

<P>

Briefly summarize the positions regarding universal service of John
Browning in his article "Universal Service (An Idea Whose Time Is Past)",
and and Steven Miller in Chapter 8, "Universal Service (Giving Everyone a
Chance)".  Do they mean the same thing by universal service?  What do they
propose we should do?  Finally, what do <em>you</em> think we should do?
