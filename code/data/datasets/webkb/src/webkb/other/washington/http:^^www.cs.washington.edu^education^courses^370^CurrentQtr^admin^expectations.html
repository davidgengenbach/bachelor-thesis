<h2>CSE370 Workload and Grading</h2>

<hr>
<h3>Workload</h3>
<p>
The course consists of the following elements:
<ol>
 <li>Lectures: there will be a total of 30 hours of lectures.
 <li>Reading: we will be covering most of the Katz text.
 <li>Assignments: problem sets involving design problems, to be solved 
     with the use of computer-aided design tools, including a substantial
     design project for the last three weeks of the quarter.
 <li>Quizzes: there will be a 10 minute quiz every sixth lecture for 
     a total of five over the duration of the quarter.
 <li>Final exam: a two hour exam during finals week.
</ol>
<p>
We will try to keep the workload at what is typical for a course of 
three credits, namely, six to nine hours per week outside of the 
lectures.  If we do not manage to do this, please let me know using
the <a href="../feedback/">feedback form</a> and explain which parts
of the course are causing you spend too much time.
<p>
Software tools frequently consume more time then they should.  We hope
that we will design the assignments in such a way as to get you up to
speed with the tools slowly but undoubtedly there will be a bit of a 
start-up cost with any new tool.  Consider it to be similar to learning 
a new language and compiler and getting familiar with the process.
Every tool imposes a certain model.  Frustration can be high until you
assimilate that model and learn to use it.  Until you learn to use the
model effectively make sure to ask for help and not spend countless 
hours making no progress.
<p>
You are expected to turn in neat and complete weekly assignments.  We
strongly urge you to use the graphical and word processing tools you 
will have available on our computing environment to prepare them.  This
will include a schematics editor, state diagram editor, and waveform
display.
<p>
We will make solutions available on the course web for each of the
assignments, quizzes, and final exam in a timely fashion.

<hr>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>
The grade for the course will be computed as follows:
<ul>
 <li>25%: weekly assignments (except for project)
 <li>25%: project (last three weekly assignments)
 <li>15%: five bi-weekly quizzes
 <li>25%: final exam
 <li>10%: course participation
</ul>
The instructor will grade all the quizzes and the final exam.  The 
weekly assignments will be graded by the teaching assistant.  The
project will be graded by both.  Weekly assignments will not be
accepted after the due date (unless there are serious extenuating
circumstances).  Grading of the weekly assignments will be on a
coarse scale of 1.00, .75, .50, .25, or .00.  It is expected that 
you will carefully review the solutions provided on the course web 
before questioning a grade with either the instructor or teaching 
assistant.
