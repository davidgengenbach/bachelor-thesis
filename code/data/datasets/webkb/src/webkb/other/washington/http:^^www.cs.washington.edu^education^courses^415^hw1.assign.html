CSE 415		Homework 1 	due Thursday, April 18, 1996


	Now that we have introduced Lisp, it is time to do some 
problems on the AI concepts we have discussed in class.
	Besides the readings and problems about Lisp (in Touretzky),
you should now have read the first three chapters of Rich and Knight,
without spending too much time on the details of the different algorithms
for tic-tac-toe and the water-jug problem. Our discussion of chess was
more general, and more interesting!
	In our last class, after talking about various search algorithms,
and pruning heuristics, I asked you to read about alpha-beta pruning for 
chess. This is covered in chapter 12 of Rich and Knight, so now I am 
asking you to read all of chapter 12. It is about Game Playing, but the
search and pruning techniques are applicable to many problem-solving
situations.


		Homework Problems

	Problems 1, 2, 3, 4  in chapter 12, page 326, Rich and Knight.


	The following chess problem is from the Kasparov vs Deep Blue
(IBM's chess playing system) game, where the computer won:-

	Kasparov resigned when it was his turn to play (he was black).
At that point, the board positions were as follows:-

	White positions (deep blue):

	a3  P,  b3  P,  d5  Q,  g3  P,  g5  N,  h2  K,  h3  P,  h7  R

	Black positions (Kasparov):    {black pieces have a ' symbol}

	d4  P',  e1  R',  f2  N',  f3  P',  f6  Q',  h6  K'


	The notation is standard for chess. With white starting on the board
closest to you, the rows are numbered 1, 2, 3, ..., 8, and the columns are
marked a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h.

	knights are represented by N.

	Your problem is to finish the game without making any unreasonable
moves, with as few moves as possible. You will note that Kasparov could win
at any time (with the above board positions) if white did not keep the black
king in check.
	Then, for your end-game, give the branching factor at each move,
and give your best guess as to the heuristics that could have guided 
either Kasparov or deep blue, at each move. (Both Kasparov and deep blue
used recall of past good situations for the end-game, but your answer here
should disregard that.)
