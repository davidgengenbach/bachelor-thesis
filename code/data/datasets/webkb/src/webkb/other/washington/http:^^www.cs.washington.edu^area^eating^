<h2>
<a name=intro>
Introduction
</h2>

Seattle is a good city for restaurants.  There are notable restaurants
in all price ranges and for most major cuisines.  Seafood is a very
good bet.  A number of restaurants have sprung up that serve what
could be called "Northwest Cuisine," specializing in fresh local
ingredients.  European restaurants are well represented, with Italian
being particularly strong.  There are a large number of Thai
restaurants which are consistently good, and a smattering of
Vietnamese restaurants.  There are a number of good Japanese
restaurants.  In addition to being a good place to eat, Seattle is
also a good place to drink: there are several microbreweries that make
very good beers, and Northwest wines are gaining increasing
recognition.<p>

Many of the restaurants are within walking distance from Downtown 
hotels (especially the Downtown, Pike Place Market, and some of 
the Capitol Hill restaurants).   The restaurants listed for Pioneer Square,
the International District, Seattle Center, and the eastern reaches of 
Captiol Hill are further away but still within walking distance; 
you can also, of course, take the bus (the new downtown bus tunnel 
is worth a visit in any case) or a cab.  Bus access to the University 
district is particularly easy.<p>

Street addresses in Seattle are potentially confusing.  Seattle is
divided into a number of regions, and the streets are designated with
the appropriate compass points.  In downtown the compass point is
empty.  The compass points are significant, since 1st Ave N is
different from 1st Ave NE is different from 1st Ave NW is different
from 1st Ave.  Streets generally run east-west and Avenues generally
run north-south (although in some areas, such as downtown, east-west
and north-south are used in a weak sense).  Both streets and avenues
are numbered, so after a series of wrong turns, you could find
yourself at the corner of 45th and 45th (in fact there are several
different places in the city where you could find yourself at this
intersection).  The compass point comes <i>before</i> an 
(east-west-running) street name, as in N 50th Street, 
and <i>after</i> a (north-south-running) avenue name, as in 9th Avenue
NE.  This makes the use of "street" and "avenue" redundant, so they
are often omitted.<p>

The restaurants below are open seven days a week unless otherwise
noted, but call to be safe.  Restaurants are classified as
inexpensive, inexpensive-moderate, moderate, moderate-expensive, and
expensive.  A listing of restaurants by type of food follows the main
listing.<p>

None of these restaurants will disappoint.  We have marked with an
asterisk (<b>*</b>) restaurants particularly recommended for the
infrequent visitor to Seattle.  We should note that these selections 
and the accompanying comments are the personal opinions of various 
members of the Department. <p>

<! ------------------------------------------------------------- !>

<h3>
<a name=downtown>Downtown</a>
</h3>  

<dl>
<dt> <b>Dahlia Lounge *</b>, 1904 Fourth Avenue, 682-4142
<dd>  Moderate-expensive. Tom Douglas has been a pioneer in Northwest cuisine, and 
the food and decor here is eclectic.

<dt> <b>Fullers *</b>, Seattle Sheraton Hotel, Sixth Avenue and Pike,
447-5544
<dd>  Expensive.  Consistently one of the highest rated restaurants in
the city.  Atmosphere and service are quite formal, at least by Seattle 
standards.

<dt> <b>McCormick's Fish House</b>, 722 Fourth Avenue, 682-3900
<dd> Moderate-Expensive.  Very wide range of fresh seafood.  A bit noisy.

<dt> <b>Metropolitan Grill</b>, 820 Second Avenue, 624-3287
<dd> Moderate-Expensive.  A well-regarded steakhouse.  We don't
much like steaks, but you might.

<dt> <b>Nikko *</b>, Fifth and Stewart (Westin Hotel), 322-4905
<dd>
Moderate-Expensive.  Historically the best sushi in Seattle.
Recently transplanted from the International District.

<dt> <b>The Painted Table</b>, Alexis Hotel, Madison at First Avenue
624-3626
<dd>  Moderate-expensive.  Interesting, well-prepared American/Northwest 
food in a very  pretty setting.   A good choice for a "typical Seattle" top 
restaurant.

<h3>
<a name=pikeplacemarket>Pike Place Market</a>
</h3>

<dl>
<dt> <b>Campagne</b>, 86 Pine, 728-2800

<dt> <b> Cafe Campagne</b>
<dd> A less formal, less expensive version of Campagne (above).

<dt> <b>Chez Shea *</b>, Pike Place Market, 467-9990
<dd> Expensive.   Tiny restaurant serving Northwest cuisine upstairs 
in the Market Building itself. Closed Sunday and Monday.

<dt> <b> Etta's Seafood</b>, Western near north end of the Market, 443-6000
<dd>
The new incarnation of Cafe Sport, a less expensive, less formal, 
but still eclectic version of the Dahlia Lounge also conceived and managed 
by Tom Douglas.  Early reports (and crowds) are extremely positive.

<dt> <b>The Pink Door</b>, 1919 Post Alley, 443-3241
<dd>  Moderate.  Cheap wine and decent interesting pasta dishes.  
Fun, casual atmosphere, particularly when the outdoor deck is usable.

<dt> <b>Place Pigalle</b>, Pike Place Market, 624-1756
<dd>  Moderate.  Inside the market, great views, good fresh seafood.

<dt> <b>El Puerco Lloron</b>, 1501 Western Avenue (Pike Place Hillclimb)
<dd>  Inexpensive.  Authentic Mexican food.
Really sort of a cafeteria and take-out joint; worth a stop if you're
there and hungry.

<dt> <b>Labuznik *</b>, 1924 1st Avenue, 682-1624

one of Seattle's best restaurants.  Imaginative preparation of meat dishes.

bar area up front. Closed Sunday and Monday.

<dt> <b>Lamperia</b>, 2400 1st Avenue, 443-3301
<dd>  Expensive.  Exquisitely prepared food, Continental / Northwest.

art galleries and bars/cafes.

<dl>

<dt> <b>Al Boccalino *</b>, 1 Yesler Way, 622-7688

The bar has decent pizza and calzone.

<dt> <b>Viet My</b>, 129 Prefontaine Place S, 382-9923
<dd> Inexpensive. Hole in the wall place with good Vietnamese food.

<h3>
<a name=udistrict>University District</a>

<dd> Inexpensive.  Ethiopian.  Closed Monday.
