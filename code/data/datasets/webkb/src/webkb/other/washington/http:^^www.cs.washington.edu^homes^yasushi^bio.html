<h2>Secret Life of Yasushi Saito</h2>

<p>
I was in <a href="http://www.jnto.go.jp">Japan</a> before coming to
Seattle.  I was born in a small village in
<a href="http://www.kagawa-net.or.jp/">Shikoku island</a>. I lived
in Kyoto, Dallas(TX), Osaka, and Tokyo then.
I graduated <a
href="http://www.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp">Department of Information
Science</a> at <a href="http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp">University of
Tokyo</a> (BS '90, MS '92). My mentor was Ken Sakamura. In BS study, I
remember
having mucked around a prototype computer
called <small>BTRON1</small> and written a GUI
language that vaguely resembled sTk.  And believe me, I did MS study
in theory field(about developing a formal specification of an embedded
OS and verifying an implementation I wrote).

<p>
I had been working from '92 to '94 at Access Ltd, a small software
company in Tokyo that was even not Internet-reachable(and still not now).
I tried to
create a NFS server on PC from scratch, but I quit the company just
before it completed. Also, I was in charge of overall LAN management.
This was where I gained lots of UNIX experience.

Between '94 and '95, I was kind of jobless. I some times worked as a
parttime programmer at some companies and universities.
<p>
Besides hacking, I swim(but not recently), scuba dive, run, bicycle and ski.
I'm also a travelling addict. I visited Thai this spring but this caused
among some people a suspicion that I don't understand :).
I traveled across central American countries
from Guatemala to Costa Rica this Summer('96).

FAQ:
<ol>
  <li> <em>What does "Yasushi" mean?</em><br>
       Contrary to what many people believe, my name has nothing to do
       with Sushi.
       Yasushi writes "Ì÷" in Japanese letter(If you are in Netscape,
       choose Options/Document Encoding/Japanese (Auto-Detect) to see
       the the stuff inside "")
       
       It seems to mean "stability"  according to my parents.
       My father is Muneyasu, and he gave the latter part of
       his name to me.
       <p> You are free to call me Yas if yasushi is too long.
  <li> <em>What does "Saito" mean?</em><br>
       This I don't know really. In kanji, "Saito" consists of two letters
       "sai"(ºØ) and "to"(Æ£). "To" is the same letter as the first letter of
       "Fujiwara"(Æ£¸¶) family, a famous aristocrat in medieval Japan.
       And "sai" usually means "funeral" or something. So my guess is that
       "Saito" family branched from Fujiwara family and specialized in
       rituals.
