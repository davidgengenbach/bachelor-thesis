<H1> Research </H1>

I do artificial intelligence research at the University of Washington.
My research, like much of the AI group here, falls into two
categories: planning and software agents. <p>

<H3> Planning </H3>

I built a solver called <!WA0><!WA0><a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/ai/www/fabian.html">
FABIAN </a> for the classical planning problem.  FABIAN extends the
notion of least commitment to the choice of which action to add to
establish a subgoal. FABIAN reasons about the common properties of
sets of possible single actions that can solve a subgoal.  <p>

<H3> Agents </H3>

I am working with Cody Kwok and Dan Weld on an information gathering
agent called Occam.  <!WA1><!WA1><a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/ctkwok"> Cody </a> has
written a paper on that.
