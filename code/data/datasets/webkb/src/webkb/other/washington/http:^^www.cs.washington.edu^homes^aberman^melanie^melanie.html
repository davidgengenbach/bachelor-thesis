Hi.  I was born on May 24, 1996. Here are some pictures of me!
<p>
Here I am, asleep in my crib, just 3 days old.  Jessica Rupp made me
a nice blanket which I'm wrapped in right now.  <a href = "Gramma.html">Gramma</a> 
made me that cute hat I'm wearing. Unfortunately, Mommy and Daddy then
put me in my crib, which, as you can see, totally clashes with my pretty
blanket and hat.  I guess fashion sense skips a generation.

This is a day later.  They've put me on their bed and dressed me
in Tweety Bird. That's 
Gramma's arm in the foreground.<p>

Here's a picture of Mommy and Daddy and Me together.  <p>

I'm one week old today!  I celebrated by sleeping. My Great Grandma 
made that nice blanket for me.

Here I am at my <a href = "britbat.html">Brit-Bat</a>.  I'm the one sleeping.
Auntie Lisa was nice enough to lend me her shoulder for a while.<p>

Here I am at 5 weeks.  Aren't I angelic?

I got some professional photos done at seven
weeks.  Here's one of them.

This one was at 2 months.

Mommy and Daddy and I went to Victoria for their 5th wedding anniversary.
Here's a picture of us at the Buschart Gardens

Here I am trying to get up.  It's not working. You can see one of
Custard's paws to my right.  He just lays around a lot.

Mommy goes to this group where lots of mothers gather around with their
babies.  Here's a picture of us (the babies, not the mommies):
