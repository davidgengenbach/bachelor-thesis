        CSE 415         Programming Assignment 1        due April 11


Write a Lisp function which will remove all the vowels from a sentence, S.
Then run your function and show the output, when S is the sentence:

        t h e - q u i c k - b r o w n - f o x - j u m p s - o v e r -

        t h e - l a z y - d o g

Note that each letter here is an atom (with a space between each letter)
and that words are separated by hyphens.
