Here is a sample of the projects I worked on or I am currently working on:
<ul>
<li><i>The Homepage-Finder</i><br>
Shortly after my arrival at the University of Washington I joined Jonathan
Shakes in his Homepage-Finder project. He is trying to set up a web-service
that let's the user easily find homepages on the world wide web. Check out
the current progress at

<li><i>HighTension Therapy module</i><br>
In my 3rd and 4th year at the University of Bielefeld I worked in the
HighTension project, in order to build a rule-based therapy module for an
ongoing research project (the 
<!WA1><!WA1><a href="http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/techfak/ags/wbski/hypercon/">
HYPERCON</a>- system). The implementation language was CommonLISP, and we
used the Knowledge Shell <em>Knowledge Craft</em> from Carnegie Group.<p>
<li><i>University of Bielefeld Library Web Server</i><br>
In 1995 I set up the first Web Server in the University Library, including
the hardware and software/OS selection, installation and maintainance, and
the creation of the library web HTML pages. Although it is now maintained 
by a large group of people from various departments, you still might find 
me on the editorial page:
