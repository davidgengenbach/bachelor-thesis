<h2>Research interests</h2>

I am currently working on the <!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><a href =
"http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/levy/opal/opal.html"> Opal</a>
project. <p>
My adviser is <!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><a href ="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/levy/">Hank
Levy</a>. 
<p>
Others in the Opal group are:
<ul>
<li> <!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/~chase/">Jeff Chase</a>, now a faculty
member at Duke
<li> <!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/feeley">Mike Feeley </a>
<li> <!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/tiwary">Ashutosh Tiwary </a>
<li> <!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/dylan">Dylan McNamee</a>
</ul>
<p> 

My research interests are:
<ul>
<li> <b>Operating systems support for Object Oriented Databases
(OODBs).</b>  We are looking at key issues in databases such as
persistence, buffering, recovery, locking, swizzling and prefetching; and how
support for these can be achieved on (modern) commodity operating
systems.<p>

<li> <b>Benchmarking OODBs.</b> We have developed and implemented a
trace-based benchmarking methodology that overcomes many of the problems
with current OODB benchmarks. Within this framework, users, developers and
researchers of OODBs can analyze the performance of applications and the
database in a controlled manner.<p>

<li> <b><!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/mobicomp/mobile.html">Mobile
Computing</a>.</b> I did an internship with <!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><a href = 
"http://www.geoworks.com/">Geoworks</a>. They develop software for PDAs.<p>

<li> <b> Database Performance.</b> I did another internship at <!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><a href =
"http://www.research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Research</a> in the <!WA9><!WA9><!WA9><!WA9><!WA9><a href =
"http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/db">Database
group</a>. I worked on physical database design. <p>


<li> <b> Transactions, coherence & recovery in distributed systems.</b> I
worked on a project in which we designed, implemented and analyzed a
log-based, distributed shared-memory (DSM) system to support fine-grained
sharing of objects over a network. The log is used both for recovery and
for maintaining coherence of caches.
