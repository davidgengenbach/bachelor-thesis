Here are some of my favorite books, CD's, and other media-, multimedia-,
and hypermedia-based diversions.  Oh, and if you make it all the way to
the end, there's a really tasty recipe...

<H2>Memorials to Dead Trees - Books</H2>

<p>
For complete references to the works below, telnet to the
<!WA0><!WA0><A href="telnet://locis.loc.gov">Library of Congress Catalog</A>.

<UL>
<LI> <p>
     Horror fiction by <b>H.P. Lovecraft</b>.  Check out his mostly-complete
     works in four volumes, edited by S.T. Joshi:
     <OL>
     <LI><i>The Dunwich Horror and Others</i> (ISBN 0-87054-037-8)
     <LI><i>At the Mountains of Madness</i> (ISBN 0-87054-038-6)
     <LI><i>Dagon and Other Macabre Tales</i> (ISBN 0-87054-039-4)
     <LI><i>The Horror in the Museum</i> (ISBN 0-87054-040-8)
     </OL>
     </p>

     <p>
     Discussions of Lovecraft and his work may be found on the newsgroup
     <!WA1><!WA1><A href="news:alt.horror.cthulhu">alt.horror.cthulhu</A>.  And
     <em>no</em>, the Necronomicon is <em>not</em> real!
     </p>
  
<LI> <p>
     <b>Umberto Eco</b>'s novel <i>Foucault's Pendulum</i> 
     (ISBN 0-345-36875-4).  Be prepared to do your homework on 
     Western mysticism in order to enjoy this one fully.  Is 
     there a Kabbalist in the house?
     </p>

<LI> <p>
     Various works by <b>Lewis Carroll</b>.  If all you've read is
     <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, you're missing some great stuff.
     Look for Carroll's complete works, published by Nonesuch Press
     (ISBN 1-87106-114-8).  For online, full-text versions of the more 
     popular stories and poetry, head to
     <!WA2><!WA2><A href="http://www.promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenberg</A>'s archives.
     </p>

     <p>
     Some of my favorite works by Carroll:
     <UL>
     <LI>"The Hunting of the Snark - An Agony in Eight Fits" (1876)
     <LI>"Phantasmagoria" (1869)
     <LI>"A Tangled Tale" (1880)
     </UL>
     </p>
     
<LI> <p>
     Short Stories by <b>Jorge Luis Borges</b>.  Given that I like Eco
     and Lovecraft, the astute reader should have guessed that Borges
     would show up eventually.  Look for <i>El Libro de Arena</i>,
     e.g. the edition of Plaza &amp; Janes, S.A. (ISBN 84-01-42139-X).
     H.P. Lovecraft fans will be interested in the story "There are 
     More Things", which Borges dedicated to Lovecraft.
     </p>

<LI> <p>
     <i>The Cyberiad</i> by <b>Stanislaw Lem</b> (I have HBJ's English
     Edition, ISBN 0-15-623550-1).  Follow master constructors Trurl and
     Klapacius as they build everything from a poetry-composing computer
     (see this poetic <!WA3><!WA3><A href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/jbuhler/cyberiad.html">sample</A>) to a machine that
     can create Nothing.
     </p>

<LI> <p>
     <i>Applied Cryptography</i> by <b>Bruce Schneier</b>
     (ISBN 0-471-59756-2).  Bruce has collected a mountain of useful
     information about secure (and insecure) encryption methods to preserve
     secrecy of communications, including source code and an extensive
     bibliography.  You don't have to be a mathematician or a hacker to
     appreciate the material.

     On the Internet, nobody knows you're a cat.  If you <em>are</em> a
     cat (or live with one), you may enjoy these books by
     <b>Henry Beard</b>:
     <UL>
     <LI><i>French for Cats</i> (ISBN 0-679-40676-X).  Teach your cat
         useful such phrases as:
         <UL>
         <LI><i>Je ne veux pas &ecirc;tre ch&acirc;tr&eacute;</i>.<br>
             (I do not want to be neutered.)

             c&ocirc;t&eacute;</i>.<br>
             (Please kill the dog next door.)
         </UL>

<H2>The Music of the Spheres - CD's</H2>

<p>
<UL>
<LI> <p>
     <b>Anonymous 4</b>, a female vocal quartet specializing in early
     and medieval music, is a favorite of mine.  Look for the following
     on the Harmonia Mundi label:
     <UL>
     <LI><i>An English Ladymass</i> - chant and polyphony from 13th
         century England
     <LI><i>Love's Illusion</i> - motets etc. from the Montpellier Codex,
         a 13th century French book of <i>fin amours</i> poetry set
         to music
     <LI><i>On Yoolis Night</i> - English and Latin Christmas music from
         the 13th through 15th centuries.
     <LI><i>The Lily and the Lamb</i> - yet more chant and polyphony
         from medieval England
     </UL>

     I am not a drooling <b>Enya</b> junkie, but my cat is.  At his request,
     I'll mention some titles which other cat owners may consider as
     gift items for their own furry children.  The following CD's are

Trace the exploits of intrepid (though occasionally clueless) FBI
agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully as they chase down the Monster of
the Week (TM); or narrowly escape the Evil Government Conspiracy (TM).
You can watch the Net mercilessly dissect each new episode on the

Incidentally, I live in Western Washington and have visited the Olympic
Peninsula on occasion, but I have yet to see any

Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed.  On the other hand, I have
some great shots of Snoqualmie Falls (Twin Peaks).
