<h3>Utility Models and Goals</h3>

A goal is a restrictive measure of how 
good a plan is.  Preference or utility models can be arbitrarily expressive about 
plan quality, but how do you use them to generate plans?
   <ul>
     <li> Work with 
        <!WA0><a href="http://www.cs.uwm.edu/faculty/haddawy/index.html"> Peter Haddawy</a> 
          explores the form of 
         utility models 
         that incorporate traditional symbolic goals with information 
         about temporal deadlines, partial satisfaction, and resource 
         consumption. Publications include:
          <ul>
           <li> <i> Issues in Decision-Theoretic Planning:  Symbolic Goals and Numeric 
                  Utilities</i>, which appears in the Proceedings of the 1990 
                  DARPA Planning Workshop,
           <li> <i> Representations for Decision-Theoretic Planning:  Utility
                     Functions for Deadline Goals</i> which appears in the 
                     KR92 Proceedings, 
           <li> <!WA1><A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ai/haddawy-hanks-aij-submission.ps.Z">
                   <i> Utility Models for Goal-Directed Decision-Theoretic Planners</i></a>,
                   which is under review for journal publication.
          </ul>
   </ul>
      <li> Work with <!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mikew"> Mike Williamson</a>
           explores how these formal models can be integrated with a least-commitment 
           planning algorithms.  The result is PYRRHUS, a planner that generates optimal 
           plans in a delivery-truck domain (using the <!WA3><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/hanks/projects/testbeds.html"> Truckworld
           testbed</a>.  See 
           <!WA4><A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ai/williamson-hanks-pyrrhus-aips94.ps.Z">
                   <i> Optimal Planning with a Goal-Directed Utility Model</i></a>,
                   which appeared in the AIPS94 proceedings.
