<h3> John Lee Hooker </h3>

<p>

John Lee Hooker has been playing blues guitar since the 1940's
and he shows no signs of slowing down. His most recent albums,
<i> Chill Out</i>, <i> The Healer</i>, <i> Mr. Lucky </i>
feature more elaborate studio-produced arrangements with 
a variety of younger guest musicians. However, I also enjoy
listening to his older recordings with small groups or playing
solo.
