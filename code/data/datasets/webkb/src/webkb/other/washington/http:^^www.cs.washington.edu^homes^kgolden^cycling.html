<H1> Bicycle Touring </H1> <P>

<IMG ALIGN=right SRC=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kgolden/pics/bike/bike.gif> <p>

Let's get this clear right from the start: I love bike touring.  
<p> 

First off, I love to travel, and there's just no better way to see and
experience the countryside than by bike.  You see more than you do when going 
by car because -- let's face it -- you're going slower.  It's also easier
to stop to see those deer or take in that view.  Additionally, you hear and
smell things that you are oblivious to in a noisy, smelly car.  Did I
mention I hate cars?

<p> Second, it's great exercise.  Biking is low impact, highly aerobic, and
easy to improve in quickly.

<p> Finally, it's a great way to experience nature.  When you're getting
away from it all, you can leave it further behind if you don't have a car.

<p> For those of you who care about such things, this is my trusty steed, a
Fisher Zebrano hybrid that I've modified for touring.  I've had it for a year,
and put about 5500 miles on it.

In August, I set out with some especially 
<a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kgolden/pics/bike/shady.gif">shady</a>
characters on a bicycle expedition down the Pacific Coast, from Seattle
to San Francisco (I continued on to San Diego).  These comrades-in-lycra
were <a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kgolden/pics/bike/marc.gif">Marc
Friedman</a>, <a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kgolden/pics/bike/ruben.gif">Ruben Ortega</a>, and <a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kgolden/pics/bike/jim.gif">Jim
Giordano</a>.  We <a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kgolden/pics/bike/campin.gif">camped
out</a> almost every night, and shared our campsites with <a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kgolden/pics/bike/tiger.gif">wild
animals</a>, but we didn't let the harshness of our surroundings prevent us
from preparing <a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kgolden/pics/bike/cooking.gif">gourmet</a>
meals.  We generally cooked breakfast and dinner, and went out for lunch.
Despite eating on the bikes, we were generally very <a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/kgolden/pics/bike/hungry.gif">hungry</a>
by the time we stopped for lunch.  Here's an abbreviated mileage log of our
trip.
