<h2> Personal Information </h2>
<p>
I'm a graduate student in the <!WA0><a
href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/">Deptarment of Computer Science at the
University of Washington.</a> 

<h3> My roots </h3>

My home town is a small place called Sakleshpur, in the state of 
<!WA1><a href="http://spiderman.bu.edu/misc/karnataka/">Karnataka</a>
in <!WA2><a href="http://spiderman.bu.edu/misc/india/">India</a>. Back in 1956,
after his retirement, my grandfather bought some land near Sakleshpur and
developed a coffee estate. The area around Sakleshpur is ideal for growing
coffee, and most of the coffee grown and exported by India comes from this
region. It's a mountainous region with volcanic soil and heavy (100+ inches
a year) rainfall. The estate is now being run by my parents. One day, I'll
be there too.
<p>
I grew up in <!WA3><a href
="http://spiderman.bu.edu/misc/karnataka/districts/bangalore/index.html">Bangalore</a>
(formerly known as the Garden City -- now known as the Silicon City),
which is the capital of Karnataka. It's about 150 miles east of
Sakleshpur. Bangalore has changed a whole lot in the past 5 years, 
with all those high-tech multinationals opening shop and pouring in
big bucks. 
<p>

<h3>Other Stuff</h3>
<!WA4><a
href="http://www.indiaworld.com/">Indiaworld</a> has up to date news from
India, and articles from Indian newspapers and magazines.
