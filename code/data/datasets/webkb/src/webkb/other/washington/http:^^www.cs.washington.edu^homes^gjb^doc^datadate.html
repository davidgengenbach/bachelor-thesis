<STRONG>Data Date</STRONG> is a fundraising business I started in 1988

<H2>How It Works</H2>
It's easy:
<OL>
<LI>Your organization plans the questionnaire to be distributed.
<LI>After returning that rough questionnaire, we produce a typeset-quality,
single-page containing your questions and a response section.   We
mail that form back to you.
<LI>You make plenty of photocopies of the form, and distribute them.
<LI>You collect the completed response sections for a week or so, then
return them all to us.
<LI>Our data entry specialists enter the data.
<LI>Magical Matchmaking takes place on a Commodore 128.
<LI>We print out a results data sheet for each returned form, and
return all of these to you.
<LI>You sell as many data sheets as you can, and return the remainder
<LI>We charge only for the data sheets you sold!
