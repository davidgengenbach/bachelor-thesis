<h1>A Programming Methodology for Disconnected Operation</a></h1>

This paper describes <a href="./postscript/grovemef.ps">a programming
methodology for disconnected operation</a> that decreases the
complexity of the programming process.  The basis of our methodology
is to provide the abstractions that allow the programmer to think
about the application's connected and disconnected behavior in a
disjoint fashion. These abstractions make it is easier for him to
reason about the application's overall behavior.
