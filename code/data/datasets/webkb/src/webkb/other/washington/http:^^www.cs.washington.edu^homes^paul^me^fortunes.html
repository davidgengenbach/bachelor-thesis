<h1>Fortunes</h1>
<p>What follows is merely a collection of fortunes I and others
have received.  If you want to contribute some, drop them on my
keyboard (if you're local) or email them to me.  (But I want
these to be fortunes someone has actually received at a
restaurant.)</p>
<p>If/when this collection gets large enough, I'll probably create
something which gives you one at random.</p>
