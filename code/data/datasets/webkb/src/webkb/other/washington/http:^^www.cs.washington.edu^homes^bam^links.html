   I have an odd collection of links.  I don't necessarily agree with
what's in them, and I haven't even looked at many of them yet.  Some are
cheesy, some are esoteric, and a lot aren't quite what I wanted. But
they're all links that interested me, and links that I wanted to be able
to recall easily so I could (re)explore them.  My page, like anything else
on the Web, is mostly a glorified hotlist. 
<P>
   Clicking on a picture on this page or the pages beneath it will
take you to the site I stole the picture from.  Don't forget to look
at my <A HREF = "personal.html">personal page</a> to see links to the
things I'm most interested in.
<P>
   And away we go...
