<h1>How to pronounce "Shuichi"</h1>
Or,
<h2>Feeling weird at 3am in the morning</h2>


The name <em>Shuichi</em> is <strong>Japanese</strong>.  In Japan,
male names often signify expectations that the parents have of him.<p>

Take, for example, my name.  The japanese character breakdown is:<br>

<!WA0><img align=middle src="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/skoga/images/shuichiNameBig.xbm" alt="My Name is Here"><br>

The first character, pronounced <strong>shu</strong> (or, perhaps,
<strong>shoe</strong>), is the Japanese character for
<em>outstanding</em>.<p>

The second character, pronouned <strong>ichi</strong>, is the Japanese
character for the <em>number one</em>, which signifies that I was the
first-born.<p>

So, since my parents had expected great things out of me, and I was
the first-born child, my name is <strong>Shuichi</strong>.<p>
