<h2>Programmer Of The Month - what it be and why it are ...</h2>
Once every couple of months, 
<a href="fah_home.html">The POTM-Master</a>
poses some kind of problem that can be solved with a program of some sort.
(We currently support C, C++, PERL, JAVA, and UNIX shells/tools 
of various sorts.)
<p>
Folks from all around the world mail in their source code and their results
are compared.  After breaking all the ties, a winner is declared and they get
custody of the famous rotating POTM trophy until the next contest.
<p>
It is for FUN ... nothing more, nothing less.  It started as a contest for
AT&T folks, and (since 1993) 
has grown to a global community of a little under 1000
people from various companies and universities.
Anyone who can get email to me can participate!!!  Get on 
the mailing list
and make sure you hear about each new problem - even if you don't
ever enter, you may enjoy hearing about each new problem.
Email me at 
<H2>fah@potm.ffast.att.com</H2>
and I'll put you on the mailng list!
