<H1>Ed's life </H1>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/edhong/random0.txt">_</A>
Unlike most of the people at the computer science department here, I was
born in Seattle, and I have lived in Seattle for most of my life. </P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/edhong/random1.txt">_</A>
I have one brother, one sister, and a whole bunch of cousins, and an even
bigger bunch of second cousins. </P>

<P>I went to Mount Rainier high school and was the 2nd graduating class
to participate in the <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/edhong/random3.txt">_</A>
International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma program. (My older brother was
in the first graduating class to be able to take IB classes. I went to
Yale for my undergraduate degree (a B. S. in computer science and mathematics).</P>

<LI>Since obviously you might be curious about my former roommate, Sam
Rubin, I'll tell you that he's still working for the New Haven Ravens,
a minor league baseball team. He helped design their <A HREF="http://www.ravens.com">official
home page</A>. </LI>

<LI>There's used to be picture of me hidden inside some links from my Yale
home page. Fortunately for you, they have deleted my old home page. I might
get around to including a picture of <A HREF="smxizor-1.JPG">me</A><A HREF="../Images/smxizor-1.JPG">
</A>eventually. </LI>

<LI>Download the first <A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/edhong/HotSpotAid.hqx">mac
program </A>I ever wrote. Runs only on PowerPC's. Look for the shareware
game HotSpot to figure out what it's for. </LI>
