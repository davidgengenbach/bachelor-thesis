<p>
<b>The University of Washington is one of the nation's premier
research universities</b>.  For more than twenty years, UW has
ranked among the top five institutions in annual Federal
research obligations.  (Currently UW is second to Johns
Hopkins, with MIT and Stanford in third and fourth
positions.  Currently UW ranks fifth in industrial research
support.)  The UW faculty includes ninety members of the
National Academies, seven MacArthur Foundation award winners,
and four Nobel prize winners in the past decade.  Fifty seven
junior faculty have won NSF/Presidential Young Investigator
Awards.  A number of programs are ranked among the top dozen
in the nation in their fields, including Atmospheric Sciences,
Bioengineering, Biostatistics, Cell &amp; Developmental Biology,
Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Dentistry, Geography,
Neurosciences, Nursing, Oceanography, Pharmacology, Physiology,
Psychology, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Sociology,
Statistics, and Zoology.

<p>
<b>What does this mean to the State of Washington and its
citizens</b> -- students, parents, and taxpayers?
In some cases the answer is well known:  UW's
preeminence in the medical sciences, for example,
has given us Medic One, kidney dialysis, some of
the finest health care in the nation, and flourishing
bioengineering and biotechnology industries featuring
companies such as Immunex, Ostex, PhysioControl, and
Zymogenetics.
This document tells the story from the perspective
of another field:  information technology, focusing
on the Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering
and touching on related programs in the
mathematical sciences and in engineering.

<h3>A Half Century of Exponential Progress in Information
Technology:  Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How?</h3>
<p>
<b>There has been mind-boggling progress in information technology</b>,
which pervades most aspects of our lives and most aspects of
our economy.
The nation that leads in information technology enjoys enormous
competitive advantages.
America owns this leadership today, thanks to a complex interplay
between government, academia, and industry.
<p>
<b>Industry can afford to look ahead only a few years</b>.
The high risk of fundamental research, workforce mobility,
difficulty in capitalizing on internal innovations, and
shareholder behavior are among the reasons.
<p>
<b>As a nation, though, we <i>can</i> and <i>must</i> invest
for the long term</b>.  America's future depends upon our
broad-based leadership in certain key sectors, not on the
individual success or failure of specific companies.
<p>
<b>By-and-large, this work takes place in universities</b>,
with government support.
The historical track record is clear:  over
the course of many decades, federally-supported university
research has played a critical role in essentially
every aspect of information technology:  timesharing,
computer networking, workstations, computer graphics,
database technology, Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI)
circuit design, Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
architectures, I/O subsystems based
upon Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks
(RAID), parallel computing, and others.
<p>
<b>Universities transfer technology in two ways</b>.  They
transfer ideas, by licensing and by placing concepts
in the public domain.
And they transfer people:  students and faculty leave
to join or form companies.
Close industry/university interactions facilitate this
technology transfer, as well as facilitating the exchange
of insights about long-term strategic directions.
It's this pattern of innovation and technology transfer -- the
fluid interaction between academia and
industry -- that has made America the world leader in information
technology, and that will help us maintain this critical lead.
<p>
<b>The unique genius of America's university system is that it
combines research and education -- ideas and people</b>.
And it's not just graduate education.
The single most important factor in shaping my own
career was my "adoption" as an undergraduate at Brown
University by Professor Andries van Dam.
I took his course; I became his teaching assistant;
I became his research assistant; I became his protege
and friend.
And I am not alone.
Three other faculty members in my department were
Andy's undergraduate students.
The computer science department chairs at MIT,
Maryland, Princeton, and Waterloo, in addition to UW,
were Andy's undergraduate students.
The person who wrote much of the early software for
the Macintosh at Apple, and the person who oversaw the
x86 architecture family at Intel, and the person who ran
the Windows 95 project at Microsoft and now heads
Internet activities there, were Andy's undergraduate
students.
<p>
<b>That's the kind of program we run at the
University of Washington</b>:  forefront research,
and seamless integration of research with education -- a
very special kind of education that takes bright students
and brings them to the very forefront.
<p>
<b>It's critical not to take a one-dimensional view</b>.
Don't try to measure "impact" by a single measure, be it
companies created, or technologies licensed, or dollars
raised, or programs out-ranked, or students graduated.
And don't try to view Washington's higher education system
monolithically, for it <i>is</i> a system, with different
institutions serving different purposes for different
students and different employers.
You can't get your arms around this with a spreadsheet.

<h3>The University of Washington's Role</h3>

<p>
<b>The University of Washington is a very special
institution</b>.  There is nothing else like it in
an entire quadrant of the nation -- north of
California and west of Illinois.

<p>
<b>UW's research is a major industry</b>:  it brings in far
more money each year than the state budget of the
institution -- $482 million during fiscal 1996, compared
to a state appropriation of less than $300 million.

<p>
<b>Strong programs attract top-flight people to the
Northwest</b>, both as students and as faculty.

<p>
<b>These programs provide a first-rate education to
Washington residents</b>.
The University of Washington Department of Computer Science
&amp; Engineering is ranked among the top ten programs in
the nation, both for the quality of its graduate/research
programs and for the quality of its undergraduate programs.

This is the kind of education that the University of
Washington strives to provide.

relationships
equip instructional laboratories</a>; research infuses the
curriculum; research creates (and funds) opportunities for
independent study at the cutting edge; research builds
ties to leadership companies that provide co-op and
internship (and ultimately permanent employment)
opportunities.

<p>
<b>UW's graduates form the next generation of Washington's
leaders</b> in business, engineering, science, and government.

<p>
<b>These graduates staff high-technology industry</b>.
The University of Washington is the largest supplier of new
college graduates in the nation to Microsoft.
The University of Washington also is the largest supplier of
new college graduates in the nation to Intel -- Intel has
38 "Strategic Universities," and UW is #1.
The UW Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering is
essentially the only supplier to a number of major regional
firms such as DECwest Engineering, Geoworks/Seattle, and
Tera Computer.
Every year, UW CSE sends more than 100 outstanding Computer
Science and Computer Engineering majors into the Puget
Sound area workforce.

<p>
<b>Programs such as CSE import new technology to the
Northwest</b>.  UW CSE brought the Internet to the
Northwest 15 years ago, when a DECsystem-20 in our
department became the first computer in a several state
region to be attached to what was then ARPANET.
(Today, University of Washington Computing &amp; Communications
operates the attachment point for NorthWestNet, the principal
Internet service provider in the Pacific Northwest.)

original Very Large
Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuit designers in
the Northwest were trained in UW CSE</a>, in a program
co-sponsored by UW CSE, Boeing, and Caltech.
Graduates of that first course built the first
microprocessor VAX, the MicroVAX-I, at DECwest
Engineering.

<p>
<b>These programs create new technology</b>.
In the 1970s, the Pascal compiler for Digital
Equipment Corporation's then-new VAX computer was
built by UW CSE; the existence of this compiler
is given significant credit for the VAX's rapid
penetration of the academic market.
