<H3>Abstract</H3>

The Constraint Imperative Programming (CIP) family of languages integrates
constraints and imperative, object-oriented programming.  In addition to
combining the useful features of both paradigms, there are synergistic
effects of this integration, such as the ability to define constraints over
user-defined domains.  We discuss characteristics of the CIP family and
provide a rationale for its creation.  The synergy of constraints and
objects imposes additional challenges for the provision of constructs,
such as object identity and class membership, that are well-understood in
conventional language paradigms.  We discuss the benefits and challenges of
combining the constraint and imperative paradigms, and present our current
ideas in the context of the design and implementation of the
Kaleidoscope'93 language.
