<b>CSE 370 Introduction to Digital Design (3)</b> Introductory course in 
digital logic and its specification and simulation.  Boolean algebra, 
combinatorial circuits including arithmetic circuits and regular structures,
sequential circuits including finite-state-machines, use of programmable
logic devices.  Simulation and high-level specification techniques are
emphasized.  Offered: AWSp.

<hr>
<h3>Course Goals</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Understanding of digital logic at the gate and switch level including
     both combinational and sequential logic elements.
 <li>Understanding of the clocking methodologies necessary to manage the
     flow of information and preservation of circuit state.
 <li>An appreciation for the specification methods used in designing
     digital logic and the basics of the compilation process that 
     transforms these specifications into logic networks.
 <li>Facility with a complete set of tools for digital logic design
     with programmable logic devices as the implementation technology.
 <li>To begin to appreciate the difference between hardware and software
     implementations of a function and the advantages and disadvantages
     of each.
