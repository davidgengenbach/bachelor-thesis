<i>This page contains information on how to subscribe to course
mailing lists.  You should subscribe to at least 4 mailing lists -
cse143, cse143-announce, the list for your computing platform, and the
one for your section.</i>

<H2>Limitations of E-mail</H2>

A caveat about mailing lists: Mailing lists have their strong points,
but generally speaking, you'll get a lot more help via direct, human
interaction.  Go to office hours, go to the lab and talk to a
consultant, TA, or instructor.  In particular, it is nearly impossible
to debug programs via email; so taking those kinds of questions
directly to a human is the best approach.  Finally, you should
<em>never</em> post homework related code to any mailing list.

<p>

<A NAME="howto">
<H2>How do I subscribe?</H2>

To subscribe to a mailing list, send e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:majordomo@cs.washington.edu">majordomo@cs.washington.edu</A>;
with the line <PRE>subscribe <b><i>listname</i></b></PRE> in the message's
body (<i>not</i> its header), where <b><i>listname</i></b> is the name of
the list you want to join.<p>

For example, to subscribe to a standard set of groups, send mail to
majordomo with the contents
<PRE>
subscribe cse143
subscribe cse143-announce
subscribe cse143-mac
subscribe cse143-section-<b><i>ta-lastname</i></b>
</PRE>

Within a moment, you should receive a response confirming your
addition to the list.

<P>

<strong>Avoid Embarrassment!!!</strong> When subscribing to a list,
make sure you send your "subscribe" message to majordomo@cs -- not to
the mailing list!  Otherwise you'll send a message to all the students
already on the list.

<p>

If you want to leave a list, send an "unsubscribe" message to
majordomo instead.<p>
