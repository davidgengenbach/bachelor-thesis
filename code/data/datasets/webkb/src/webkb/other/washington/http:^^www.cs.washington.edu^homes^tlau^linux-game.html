<h1> The Linux Game Tome </h1>

<p>
This is a collection of links to games available for the Linux platform,
including screenshots where possible.  Games are added to the list after
I've had a chance to make sure they compile and run properly.  Unless
otherwise noted, all the games listed in the Tome will compile and run with
no modifications.  Suggestions for games which I should take a look at are
welcome!

<p>
<b>The games!</b>  The Tome has been organized into a few different
formats to make it easier to pick out that special game.<br>

<ul>
<li> <a href="tome/byname.html">Sorted by name</a>
<li> <a href="tome/byrating.html">Sorted by rating</a>
<li> <a href="tome/bytype.html">Sorted by type of game</a>
     (action/strategy/role-playing/toy)
</ul>

<b>Don't like my ratings?</b>  Here's your chance to rate these games in an
informal LGT ratings poll.  See what the <a href="vote/vote-summary.html">
current ratings</a> look like, see the <a
href="vote/vcomments.html">comments</a>, and <a href="vote/vote.html">cast
your own vote</a>!

<p>
<b>Disclaimer:</b> The method I used to rate these games is based on my
subjective opinion and, like everything else you see on the Net, should be
taken with a grain of salt.  Try before you buy.
