Call for Papers
</center></h2>

<h2><center> Seventh International Conference on Architectural Support for
Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS-VII)</center>
</h2>

<h2><center>
Cambridge, MA, 2-4 October 1996
</center></h2>

<P>

Rapid advances in hardware technology, compilers, 
operating systems, and computer architecture provide a 
rich environment for design alternatives. Like its prede-
cessors, the seventh ASPLOS conference focuses on the 
interaction of these technologies.

</p>

<P>
Full papers are solicited on, but not limited to, these top-
ics: <br>

<ul>

<li> Interaction of operating systems with architectures

<li> Interaction of compilers and programming languages with
architectures

<li> Novel approaches to processor, memory and I/O architectures

<li> Performance evaluation of experimental and novel systems

<li> Comparative (especially quantitative) analysis of architectural
and organizational design choices

<li> Effect of future hardware and software technologies on
architectures, operating systems or compilers.

</ul>

<P>                                                     

Authors should send nine double-sided copies of the submitted papers
to the program chair at the address below by <b>March 5, 1996</b>.
Papers must not exceed <b>5000 words</b>, which is approximately <b>10
pages</b> typeset 10- point on 16-point spacing. Excessively long
papers will be rejected outright by the program chair. Authors will be
notified of paper acceptance or rejection by <b>June 5, 1996</b>.
Accepted papers should be printed on special ACM forms and received by
the program chair by <b>July 19, 1996</b>.

</p>

<P>                                                              

Because the identity of the authors will not be revealed to the
referees, authors' names, affiliations, email and postal addresses,
and telephone numbers should appear only on a cover sheet together
with the paper's title.  Authors should also avoid citations that make
their identities obvious.

</p>

<P>

Submitted papers must not be simultaneously under review for any other
conference or journal, and authors should point out any substantial
overlap with their previously published work. Since ASPLOS is a
multi-disciplinary conference, papers should contain enough background
material to make them accessible to all three communities and should
make very clear the architectural tie to either operating systems or
compilers and programming languages.

</p>

<P>

Submissions will be read by the program committee and designated
reviewers and judged on scientific merit, readability, innovation and
relevance. It is recognized that papers in new areas are likely to
contain less complete quantitative evaluations than those in more
established areas. Accepted papers will be published in the
Proceedings, which will be distributed at the confer- ence and
published as an issue of the ACM SIGARCH, SIGOPS and SIGPLAN
newsletters.

</p>

<P>

Tutorials and workshops will precede the conference on October 1. If
you are interested in teaching a tutorial or leading a workshop,
please send proposals to the tutori- als/workshops chair at the
address below.

</p>

<P>

All publicity materials for the conference, including a copy of this
call for papers, an announcement of tutorial topics and workshops, an
advanced program and registration information, will be made available
on the World Wide Web at <a href =
