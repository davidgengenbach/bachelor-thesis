<h3>The Courses I Teach</h3>
<ul>
   <li><!WA5><!WA5><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/computer-science/node24.html">CSE370</a>, Introduction to Digital Logic Design (junior undergraduate)<br>
Basic logic and finite-state machine design with regular and programmable 
logic implementation.  Students use Capilano LogicWorks for simulation and 
Abel for specification of programmable logic.
   <li><!WA6><!WA6><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/computer-science/node24.html">CSE467</a>, Advanced Digital Design (junior/senior undergraduate)<br>
Continues where CSE370 leaves off and includes a practical laboratory where
students prototype circuits that include programmable logic devices and field
programmable gate arrays.  The course has two parallel tracks: one on 
implementation techniques, and another on the computer-aided design tools 
and algorithms.  Implementation exercises include interfaces to memories
and communication interfaces (e.g., busses, serial lines).
   <li><!WA7><!WA7><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/computer-science/node24.html">CSE477</a>, Digital System Design (senior undergraduate)<br>
Capstone design course in which students specify, design, construct, and 
debug their own embedded system.  Designs are done in teams of two and 
include oral and written presentation of the project.  Past projects have
included: PCMCIA interface to a CCD array for video, MIDI flute, mobile
robots of various types, 3-D ultrasonic mouse, telephone interfaces to 
control devices in a home, hand-held logic analyzer, etc. 
   <li><!WA8><!WA8><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/grad-brochure/node48.html">CSE567</a>, Principles of Digital Design (graduate)<br>
Research oriented course that exposes students to current methods in logic
design including hardware description languages, automatic logic synthesis,
simulation at various levels, and field-programmable logic for implementation.
The course includes a substantial project.
   <li><!WA9><!WA9><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/grad-brochure/node48.html">CSE568</a>, Implementation of VLSI Systems (graduate)<br>
Students design and prototype an interesting system that exploits the 
capabilities of VLSI technology and includes a custom integrated circuit
design.  Past projects have included: data compression hardware, multi-computer
routers, graphic accelerators, etc.
   <li>Others . . .<br>
Occasionally, I am called upon to teach introductory level undergraduate 
courses including: 
<!WA10><!WA10><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/computer-science/node23.html">
CSE142</a>, Introduction to Programming I (a course for all students
in the College of Engineering and many in the College of Arts & Sciences) and 
<!WA11><!WA11><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/computer-science/node23.html">
CSE373</a>, Data Structures (a course for non-majors).
</ul>
