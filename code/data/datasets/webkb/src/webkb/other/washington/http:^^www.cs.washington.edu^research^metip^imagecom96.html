<h2>Conference Outline</h2>

The last few years have seen technological and normative breakthroughs
in the field of image computing and graphics as well as in multimedia
networking.  New perception and recognition techniques close to
robotics are being developed.  These, together with convergence of
image creation, analysis and representation techniques, are leading to
new developments in multimedia production and services.  The access to
digitised image, sound and data from the workplace and from the home
relies on increasingly smarter bearer services. As added value is
transferred towards production and services, strategic alliances are
being built to take advantage of the multiplication of the
distribution channels and media. User access is being made easier,
more intuitive, by means of smarter, knowledge-based approaches. Fast
retrieval of essential information and browsing ever increasing
amounts of information require smart intelligent guides, software and
agents, as well as multimodal interfaces. Correspondingly, adequate
development of network infrastructure, architecture and protocols is
essential.

<p>
This third issue of the IMAGE'COM is co-located with the first ECMAST
(European Conference on Multimedia Applications, Systems and
Technologies) to provide a forum to monitor and anticipate the
developments that make multimedia applications possible, to exchange
information and results on recent work, and to help
cross-fertilisation of image and communication research activities.
The following is a non exhaustive list of topics addressed.

<li>
1.	Production, creation
