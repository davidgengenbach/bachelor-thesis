<head> <title> Mail Stop for UWCSE </title> </head>
<body>

<h2>UW Box Numbers</h2>

The University of Washington is changing the way mail is delivered.
Once upon a time, the CSE department was addressed by sending mail
to mail stop ``FR-35''.
Now it's addressed by sending it to ``Box 325350''.
Rumor has it that it's important that the address
appears in the order
University of Washington, Box number.
That is:
<p>

Department of Computer Science & Engineering<br>
University of Washington<br>
Box 352350<br>
Seattle, Washington 98195 USA <br>

<h2> What's that ``FR-35''? </h2>

What's that ``FR-35'' in the old address?
It's the mail stop for the
<!WA0><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/">
	Department of Computer Science & Engineering</a>.
The ``FR'' comes from the building that CS&E <em>used</em> to be in.
