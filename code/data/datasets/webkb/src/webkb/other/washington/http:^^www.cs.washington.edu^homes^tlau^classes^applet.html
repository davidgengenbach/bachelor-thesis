<h1>My first Java applet</h1>

<applet code="Maze.class" width=300 height=300>
<i>Sorry, you can't view applets.  That's ok, you didn't miss much.</i>
</applet>

<p>
Use the arrow keys to walk around in the maze.  If the arrow keys don't
work, try <tt>w</tt> for forward, <tt>a</tt> for left, and <tt>d</tt> for
right.

<p>
Anyone remember Wizardry?
