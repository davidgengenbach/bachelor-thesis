<H1>How to Reach Me</H1>
<H2>Electronically</H2>
<p>This is by far the most reliable way to contact me.  I highly
recommend it.

<H2>At School</H2>
<p>My office is in Sieg Hall, room 431, at the University of
Washington.  Sieg Hall is near the HUB, between Allen Library
and Guggenheim Hall.  It's also roughly between the HUB and the
fountain.
</p>
<p>The UW Daily, our student newspaper, has declared Sieg the
ugliest building on campus.  The best part about having an
offince inside is you don't realize how ugly it looks from the
outside, except when you're in the west stairwell.
