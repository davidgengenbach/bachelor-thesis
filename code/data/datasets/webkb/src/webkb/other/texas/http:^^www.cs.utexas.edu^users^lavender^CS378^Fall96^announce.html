Final grades have been calculated. If you want to know what you made,
send me an email.  Final exams are not returned, but you can see them
if you make an appointment with my secretary. She is only available
in the morning (9-12).  You can call her at 305-0280 to make an
appointment. You can pick up extra credit assignments at my off
campus office by also arranging a time with my secretary.

<h3>Tuesday, 3 December 1996</h3> 
A revised version of lecture 20 is available. The example of the Lock
object in C++ was incorrect. I tried to simplify some real code into
an example, and botched it up.  See the Lecture notes page for an
updated copy. I have also posted an updated example and explanation
to the course newsgroup.
<p>
Reminder: The extra credit
assignments are due in class on Thursday. No late assignments will be
accepted. I will grade them and return them the day of the final exam.

<h3>Thursday, 24 October</h3>
Network outages and machine crashes happen frequently, especially at
the most inconvenient times! As CS majors, you know these things
happen, and that you should plan for them.
<p>
To compensate for this problem, I will extend the turnin time to 5pm
on Friday, 25 October, for everyone. Hardcopy listings, diskettes 
(if required), and electronic assignments posted later than 5pm will not 
be accepted.
<p>
I will announce in class today where you can turnin your hardcopy
listings (and diskettes) if you will not be turning them in during
Thursday's class.

<p>
The first programming project will be assigned in class today. I have
arranged a Makefile and GNU debugger (gdb) tutorial for Friday, 20
September, from 4:00-5:00 pm. The tutorial will be held in TAY 2.106,
which is the classroom with the projection screen on the 2nd floor of
Taylor at the end of the hallway just past the CS departmental
offices.
<hr>
<h3>Monday, 2 September</h3>
Note the room change announced on Friday (see below).  The total
enrollment for the course was expanded to 40 students.  That
limit was quickly reached last Friday, so no more students will
be added to the course this semester. Please try the other section
of CS378 taught by Glenn Downing.
<P>
As announced in class, I am away Tuesday-Friday at a conference.
However, class is being held. On Tuesday, Bjarne Stroustrup will 
lecture on the Design of C++ (on video). On Thursday, Mark Linton
will lecture on Encapsulation and Inheritance (also on video).
<hr>
<h3>Friday, 20 August</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>ROOM CHANGE!</b> 
<P>
The class has been moved to ESB 223. This building is
on the northwest corner of 24th and Speedway, diagonally across from Taylor
Hall.
<P>
<li><B>IMPORTANT NOTICE</B>
<P>
Beginning with the 1996 summer term, the CS Department began enforcing
prerequisites for all courses.  Students who do not show proof of the appropriate
prerequisites prior to the drop date will be automatically dropped from the
course.
<P>
The prerequisites for this course are  CS 328 and CS 336 (or equivalents) with a grade of
C or better. <b><i>If you do not meet these prerequisites, the CS department
will drop you from this course.</i></b>  If you have any questions about this policy 
see an academic advisor in the Undergraduate office, TAY 2.126.
</ol>

<h3>Thursday, 29 August</h3>
As we all discovered at the first class meeting, the room assigned for the course is
very small. I have requested a change of room for the course or more desks for the 
current room. Watch this space for additional information.
