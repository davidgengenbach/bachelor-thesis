    <H2> We're having a baby! </h2>
    <P> My wife (Ashly) and I are having a baby.  We're due on October 7th.
        We don't know if it's a boy or a girl (and we want to be surprised).
    <P> We had a sonogram done of our child and have placed the pictures 
        below.      
    <HR>
    <H2> Head and Spine </h2>
    <P> This is a picture of the head and spine of our child.  The head is
        at the top of the picture and the spine travelling down the center.

    <H2> Femur </h2>
    <P> Ashly's father is an othropedic surgeon.  We got this picture of the
        femur just for him :)

    <H2> Foot </h2>
    <P> Finally, here is the baby's foot.  The foot is to the left of the 
        light arc in the middle of the picture.  The toes are pointing to
        the top of the picture.
