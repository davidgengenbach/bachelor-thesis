             Problems and Theorems in Logic</a> by Vladimir Lifschitz.<p>

This course is an elementary but mathematically solid introduction to logic.
Students will learn logic mainly by doing homework problems, by presenting
their solutions in class, and by studying the solutions presented by others.
They are expected to make a serious effort to solve every problem in
the text and to attend every class meeting.<p>

The course consists of three parts:

<ul>
<li>The axiomatic method.
<li>Propositional logic. 
<li>Predicate logic.
</ul>

Each part will be followed by a test.  The grade will be determined by the
results of the tests (30% each) and by class participation (10%).  To get
full credit for class participation, a student will need to present at least
one correct solution in each of the three parts of the course.<p>
