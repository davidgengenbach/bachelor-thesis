<h3>General Info</h3>
<P>
You should read the following information as it applies to all programs for this course:
<ul>
<li>C++ Programming Guidelines in <a href=./coding.ps>Postscript</a> or <a href=./coding.pdf>PDF</a>
<li>Submission Instructions in <a href=./submission.ps>Postscript</a> or <a href=./submission.pdf>PDF</a>
</ul>
<p>
If you are using Unix, you will need to write a Makefile. Here is a
little introduction (chapter 2 of the GNU Make manual) and two

<ul>
<li>An <a href=./make-intro.ps>Introduction to Makefiles</a> (in postscript)
<li>A <a href=./makefile>simple Makefile</a> that will get you going.
<li>A <a href=./Makefile>professional strength Makefile</a> that can
tailored to build your programs on many different systems with
different C or C++ compilers.
</ul>
<p>
If you are using the GNU G++ compiler, then you will also find the following two-page GNU Debugger (gdb) reference card handy.
You may also find it useful to use the Revision Control System (RCS). You can download a short description of how to
get started.  You should also see the online man pages for RCS commands: rcs, ci, co, rcsdiff.
<ul>
<li><a href=./refcard.ps>GDB reference card</a> (in postscript)
