<H2>Conversion of Units of Measurement</H2>

This is a demonstration of a program that converts between different units
of measurement, or combinations of units.  It can also simplify
expressions of units.
<P>
A units expression is a unit name, such as <CODE>meter</CODE>,
a number such as <CODE>2.5</CODE>, a product of two or more unit expressions
<CODE>(* expr1 ... exprn)</CODE>,
or a quotient of two unit expressions <CODE>(/ expr1 expr2)</CODE>.
Common abbreviations such as <CODE>ft</CODE> are allowed.
<P>
An example is <CODE>(/ (* atto parsec) (* micro fortnight))</CODE>.
<P>
When the program is started, a window is created containing a command menu
and input and output areas.  Click the appropriate menu items to run
the demo.
