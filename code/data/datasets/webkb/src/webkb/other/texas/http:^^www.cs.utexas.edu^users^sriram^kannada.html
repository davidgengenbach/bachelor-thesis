<h2> Ugadhi Celebration --- PLANNING STAGE</h2>

Venue:  BASTROP STATE PARK <br>

<h2> <blink> <b> Date:</b> 23rd MARCH, 1996 <br> </blink> </h2>

Time: 11:00AM to   <br>

<hr>

<p> With another year whizzing past us, it's now time
again for Ugadhi. We should seize this festive moment
to meet again and keep the Karnataka spirit high - so
that the next time you call home, even you can say
	"Habbakke navella seridvi...."

<p> This time, for a change, we plan to meet outdoors at
Bastrop State Park (25 miles SE of Austin). The park
not only boasts of many wooded trails and small lakes 
but also has a volley-ball court and open areas just
right for cricket. It also has a dining area which 
can be rented for $75. The hall could come in handy
in case of bad weather.

<p> We also plan to cater food from on of the local Indian restaurants.

<p> Assuming 75 people would attend, the event would cost
approximately $7.50 per head. The cost, especially for
children, could reduce with a larger attendance.

<p> So folks, please reply ASAP. This event's success wholly depends
on each and every one of you attending.

<p> We would also appreciate ideas for activities and
volunteers to organize the same.

<p> <b> HOPING TO HEAR FROM YOU BY TUESDAY, 27TH FEB. </b>

<p> Thank you,

<p> It would be great if you and your family can attend this occasion. <br>
Your suggestions are most welcome and please do respond to us.
