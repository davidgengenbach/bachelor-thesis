  <h1>The Compound</h1>
<p>The Compound is a loose affiliation of friends with almost nothing of
consequence in common and very little to recommend them. The group is centered
around a house with high ceilings, hardwood floors, terrible plumbing, and many
hidden nooks and crannies which could conceivably be filled with butter. Once,
three separate orders for pizza were placed on one night from the Compound. Any
alleged relationship between the Compound and the NSA is purely speculative and
will be vigorously denied (as will the existence of the NSA).
