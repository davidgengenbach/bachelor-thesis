This one looks like a pretty complete (35 pages) presentation of
their external stack idea. Maybe be more interesting as a NN technique
than language learning. We'll read it in my NN meeting this Friday; if
it turns out interesting language-acquisition-wise, I'll let you know.

Eugene Charniak: "<strong>
Tree-bank Grammars
</strong>"
<dd><i>scheduled for AAAI '96</i>
<dd><i>Abstract:</i>
By a ``tree-bank grammar'' we mean a context-free grammar created by reading the 
production rules directly from hand-parsed sentences in a tree bank. Common wisdom 
has it that such grammars do not perform well, though we know of no published data 
on the issue. The primary purpose of this paper is to show that the common wisdom is
wrong. In particular we present results on a tree-bank grammar based on the Penn Wall 
Street Journal tree bank. To the best of our knowledge, this grammar out-performs 
all other non-word-based statistical parsers/grammars on this corpus. That is, it 
out-performs parsers that consider the input as us. That is, it out-performs parsers 
that consider the input as a string of tags and ignore the actual words of the corpus.

Advances in the Computational Study of Language Acquisition
</strong>"
<dd><i>Abstract:</i> This paper provides a tutorial introduction to computational studies
of how children learn their native languages. Its aim is to make recent advances
accessible to the broader research community, and to place them in the context of
current theoretical issues. The papers reviewed here focus on learning the meanings
of words, learning the sounds of words, and learning the values of grammatical
parameters. ...

<dd><i>Abstract:</i>
This paper describes a new statistical parser which is based on probabilities of dependencies between
head-words in the parse tree. Standard bigram probability estimahead-words in the parse tree. Standard bigram probability estimation techniques are extended to
calculate probabilities of dependencies between pairs of words. Tests using Wall Street Journal data
show that the method performs at least as well as SPATTER (Magerman 95, Jelinek et al 94), which
has the best published results for a statistical parser on this task. The simplicity of the approach means
the model trains on 40,000 sentences in under 15 minutes. With a beam search strategy parsing speed
can be improved to over 200 sentences a minute with negligible loss in accuracy.

A discussion of the critical period for language learning (whether it is

{publication reference added on Feb. 9, 1994:}

This is probably too short to get the idea:
