<H1>Personal Background Info</H1>

<P>
My full name is <B> Tang, Lap Poon Rupert </B>, bornt in 
<B> Hong Kong </B>.  I have a pretty big family: 
<A HREF="http://hsb.baylor.edu/html/students/tang.ypt/home.htm">one brother
</A>
and two sisters,
besides my parents.  I was enrolled in <A HREF="http://www.utexas.edu/"> 
The University of Texas at Austin </A> in the Fall of 1991, then graduated
in the May of 95.  Now, I am in the Ph.D. program here.

My hobbies include playing chess and piano, swimming and reading.  I also like
to get up late on Sat morning (which is not a good habit and I am not going to
keep it).

How is Hong Kong like?  Hong Kong is a small city with over six million 
people.  So, it is always very crowd, no matter on street ... or anywhere.  
It is also very internationalized in its culture; most people are bilingual.
Besides speaking in our native tongue (Cantonese), we do sometimes use English
to communicate with each other.

<H1>Plans</H1>

<P>
I have graduated in the May of 1995 for my Bachelor degree in Computer Science.
Right now, I am in the Ph.D. program (Yes! it's in Computer Science again) 
which means I would be in school for (still) another few years.

Well, it may be too early to talk about my plan right now.  One thing that is
for sure though is that I need to finish my Ph.D. degree as soon as possible.
Please pray for me.  Thanks.
<P>
