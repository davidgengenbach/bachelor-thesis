     <b> SQSIM: A Simulator for Imprecise ODE Models.</b> </a>
     Technical Report AI96-247, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,
     The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, 78712, March 1996.  <P>

     Describes SQSim, an extended version of the QSIM simulator that computes
     numerical bounds on imprecisely-defined ODE models.
     <p>

<li> Herbert Kay and Benjamin Kuipers.
     <a href="file://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/qsim/papers/Kay+Kuipers-AAAI93.ps.Z">     <b> Numerical behavior envelopes for qualitative models.</b> </a>
     In  <i> Proceedings of the Eleventh National Conference on Artificial
     Intelligence (AAAI-93), </i> pages 606-613, 1993.  MIT Press.<p>

     Describes the dynamic envelope envelope method as implemented in NSIM, 
     an extension to QSIM that generates predictions for semiquantitative
     models.  
     <p>

<li> Herbert Kay and Lyle H. Ungar.
     <a href="file://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/qsim/papers/Kay+Ungar-QR93.ps.Z">     <b> Deriving monotonic function envelopes from observations.</b> </a>
     In  <i> Working Papers from the Seventh International Workshop on
     Qualitative Reasoning about Physical Systems. </i> pages 117-123, 
     Orcas Island, Washington, 1993. <p>

     Describes the SQUID (SemiQUantitative IDentification) method for
     constructing bounds on a semiquantitative model of a continuous
     system by using measurements from the system.  <p>

<li> Herbert Kay.
     <a href="file://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/qsim/papers/Kay-AITR92-188.ps.Z">     <b> A qualitative model of the space shuttle reaction control system.</b> </a>
     Technical Report AI92-188, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,
     The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, 78712, September 1992.  <P>

     Describes a QSIM model of the space shuttle's reaction control system.
     The <A href="file://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/qsim/papers/Kay-AITR92-188-model.lisp.Z"> QSIM model </A> is also available.  <P>


<LI> Herbert Kay.
     <a href="file://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/qsim/papers/Kay-MA-91.ps.Z">     <b> Monitoring and diagnosis of multi-tank flows using qualitative reasoning.</b> </a>
     Master's thesis.  The University of Texas at Austin.  May, 1991. <P>

     Describes the NSIM algorithm and applies it to the problem of monitoring
     a high vacuum chamber during pumpdown.  <P>
