<H3> Digital Photography - Experience Needed </H3>
In a very limited perspective(from what I'm interested the most), this is about
to put photo pictures on a computer screen, in another word, we're talking
about digitalize photo pictures. The most straight forward way
is to use a digital camera,
<!WA15><A HREF="http://www.kodak.com/daiHome/DC50/indexDC50.shtml"> Kodak DC-50 </A> 
is one of those pioneer products on the market, Shape, Casio also have similar
products.
<P>

I've been trying to do this in a simplfied/hobby like environment, ie.
<OL>
<LI> A conventional 35mm camera, my set is Canon Elan, with a Sigma 24/2.8, 
Canon 50/1.8II and Canon 70-210/3.5-4.5 USM.
<LI> Digitalize by Kodak PhotoCD scanner, in CMS color space.
<LI> No printer involved, don't print pictures on paper.
<LI> Publish :-) on web pages.
</OL>
I'm experimenting a way to work between CMS and RGB color spaces, I don't 
have to worry about CYMK color space as used in color printers. By far, I've 
been using Adobe Photoshop as editing tool, everything is still under 
exploration, for some pictures I've done, here's a list, some of them were
travel pictures, some were just random shots.
