<H1>Research Interests
</H1>

<!WA0><A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mleone/web/language-research.html"> Programming Languages</A> are the focus of my efforts.  While I will be working on
a Scheme compiler here at the University, I am also fascinated by the implementation
of purely 
<!WA1><A HREF="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/Department/Staff/mpj/faq.html">Functional Languages</A>
 and the problems of making such implementations efficient.  An example of this type of 
research can be found by looking at the <!WA2><A HREF="http://www.dcs.glasgow.ac.uk/fp/">Functional Programming at Glasgow</A> page.
<P>

Reflection is a way of allowing a computational system to examine,
reason about, and modify its own behavior.  Applied to a programming language
implementation, this technique might be used to allow a language 
to support different abstractions or to make given abstractions more efficient.
<!WA3><A HREF="http://www.XEROX.com/PARC/spl/eca/oi.html">Open Implementations</A> contains
pointers to a number of topics along these lines.
<P>

Syntactic extensions in <!WA4><A HREF="http://www.tkg.com/~donovan/proj/rs/rscheme.html">RScheme</A> are reputed to
be the underlying mechanism which supports reflection on scope and other compiler innards.
An out-of-date sketch of the design of a new syntactic extension facility implemented in an interpreter which might be 
the basis for this is <!WA5><A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/esteban/Thesis/thesis.html">here</A>.  The system has been documented in my Master's thesis, which
will soon be available on the <!WA6><A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/oops">OOPS Group</A> Web page.  <!WA7><A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/esteban/macros.ps>*</a>
<P>

Donald Knuth's essays on Literate Programming have also caught my interest.  Some
more information can be obtained from the 
<A HREF ="http://info.desy.de/user/projects/LitProg.html">Literate Programming Library</A>.
