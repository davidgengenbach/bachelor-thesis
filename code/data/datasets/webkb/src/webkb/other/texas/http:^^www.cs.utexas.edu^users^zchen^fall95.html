<li>
I had been baptised on Nov. 19, 1995 and joined Hyde Park Baptist Church.

I spent a good time on my Birthday Party. We had a nice dinner at my home and went to Karaok at Hunan Palace. This reminded me of my life in my hometown - Guangzhou.<br>
A bunch of my friends took part in the party:<br>

They gave me happiness and warmth. Thanx to them!
