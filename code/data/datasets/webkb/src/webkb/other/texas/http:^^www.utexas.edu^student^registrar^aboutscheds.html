The Course Schedule is published three times a year, just before advising and registration begin for each semester and summer session. It lists the courses to be offered each semester, including the time, location, and instructor for each course, if this 

information is available at the time of publication. It also gives the unique number for each course, which students must know in order to register, and other essential registration information and instructions.<P>

Follow the link at the end of the page for information on ordering a printed Course Schedule. The Course Schedule is also published in the following electronic versions:<P>
