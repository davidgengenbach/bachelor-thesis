<P>
All students in this course are known to the grading computer by a three
letter identifier called the <i>Student Access Key</i>, or
<A NAME=SAK>SAK</A>.
<p>
To get an SAK assigned, just go to the 
<!WA0><A HREF = "http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/suzy/cs304p/testroom.html">Testing Room</A>
and present your ID to the proctors.
Except for clashes, the SAK will often be the student's initials.
<p>
Go get your <i>SAK</i> as soon as possible at the beginning of the semester,
because no grades can be recorded for you until it is assigned.
<p>
When the SAK is assigned in the computer, the proctors will also create
a manila folder for it.  All quizzes, exams and programming assignments
done by this student will be filed in this folder.

<P>
You will also be given a
<A NAME=Green>Green Sheet</A>, so that you have your own record of
assignments turned-in.
Whenever a proctor grades a program or quiz, you should ask them to also
initial the corresponding block of your Green Sheet.
<p>
Remember to put your SAK on the bubble sheet of each
<!WA1><A HREF = "http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/suzy/cs304p/quizl.html">exam</a>.
