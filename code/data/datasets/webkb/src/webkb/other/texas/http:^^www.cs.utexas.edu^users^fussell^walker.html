<P>

To compile the walker demo program in the lab, do the following.  Copy
the contents of the directory
/p/src/Mesa-1.2.8/glut-3.0/progs/demos/walker to a directory under
your home directory.  Change the name of Imakefile.class to Imakefile
in your directory.  Execute the command "xmkmf" followed by the
commands "make clean" and "make" in your directory.  This should
result in the creation of the executable "walker" in your directory,
which should run on any of the lab machines.  Please note that if you
have previously copied the walker code, you should do this again
anyway, since I have made a small change to walker.c to fix a bug in
solaris that causes the cset filenames to be misread.  This bug also
shows up on the department suns running solaris, but not on aix or
linux machines.

<P>

Don't forget to 
"export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/p/lib"
or
"setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/p/lib"
before you try to run "walker."
