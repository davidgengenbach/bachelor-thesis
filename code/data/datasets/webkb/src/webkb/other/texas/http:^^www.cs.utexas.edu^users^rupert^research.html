<H2>My First Experience With Research</H2>
<P>

During the Fall of 1994, I had a chance to work with 
<!WA1><A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/risto"> Dr. Risto Miikkulainen </A> on
an original research project on <!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/nn/pages/publications/nlp.html"> Natural Languaging Processing </A> using Neural Network.
<P>
The project is to build a system that is capable of building global 
distributed representations for a large corpora.  The current system built
is quite successful in capturing the regularities of the words' usage within
a small corpora of artifical data.  And, we are trying to extend the current
system to build representations for words of natural data such as the WSJ 
(Wall Street Journal) on a large corpora.
<p>
