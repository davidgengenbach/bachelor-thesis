<H1>Fantasy and Science Fiction</H1>
<hr>
I like fantasy and science fiction, although probably sf more than
fantasy, but f&sf is the way I felt like abbreviating it here.
I'm also going to include some pointers to other types of "literature",
but the main focus will be on f&sf that I enjoy.  Since I will read
just about anything, there is no telling what you will find here, but
I tend to prefer more light reading, so there won't be much dystopian
or depressing stuff.  Sorry, but that's what I like.<p>
Most of what you will find here is lists and reviews, with perhaps the
random generic comments.<p>

<h2>Science Fiction</h2>
There may be some overlap in the divisions below, but they seem to basically
work. Also, stuff is further organized by authors, so authors end up where
I feel like their work that I read belongs, although there may be some
overlap between fantasy and sf in the listings.
