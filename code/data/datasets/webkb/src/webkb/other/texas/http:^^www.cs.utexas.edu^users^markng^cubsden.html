<FONT COLOR = "#ffff00"><H2> Introduction </H2></FONT>
I am the lion cub, and this is my head shot.
Want to know more about me? Read through this page.
I will tell you what I like, what I don't like, what cheers me up and what bores me to death. Want to date me?
Drop me a note, and yes, a photo is fine too. Find me offensive? Calm down, just remember, no one gets hurt.<BR>

<FONT COLOR = "#ffff00"><H2> What I Like </H2></FONT>
Like many people, I like alot of things, here you go:<BR>

<A NAME = "VISUAL">
<FONT COLOR = "#ffff00"><B>Arts</B></FONT><BR>

I am not an artist but I like colorful pictures alot. I am especially like the visual effects rendered by different combinations
of colors.

(I am sure I got their technical names all wrong) they all are simple and generic colors yet they all present their unique
character of themselves. Unfortunately, after numerous painting lessons I have attended during my youth, I remain the worst painter among
my clan. My friend 
<!WA6><A HREF = "http://www.inforamp.net/~svwong/">Victor</A> on the other hand is a talented computer artist. He has his own
<!WA7><A HREF = "http://www.inforamp.net/~svwong/Artwork/artwork.html">cyber art gallery</A>, that you might want to take a look at. My favourite
picture of his is the

<FONT COLOR = "#ffff00"><B>Music</B></FONT><BR>
I am not a musician either. Nor am I crazy about Tina Turner. (And of course I will turn around and run for life when I see Michael Jackson). But after many
(I won't tell you how long, just too long) years of learning piano (and gave up at the end), I have come to appreciate a little classical music.
Almost all my later piano years I've been playing Stephen Heller(1813-1888)'s boring work. I personally rather prefer the work of Schbert.
I have never developped a taste for Jazz (some of them are GREAT! but most of them... I just don't care for). Sure, I like some pop music too. 
Some of my best pals formed a band called "Siren" back a few years ago. I am not going say how good they are but I had 
tremendous fun going to the band's practicing sessions.<BR>
<A NAME = "TRAVEL">
<FONT COLOR = "#ffff00"><B>Travel</B></FONT><BR>
</A>
I have done some serious travelling during my youth and have been to many exotic places. Excluding my home country, I've stepped foot 
on the soil of more than 20 countries. Lucky me I have seen some of the greatest wonders of the world, such as
the Giza Pyramids at Giza, Egypt, the Mayan pyramids in Chichan Itza, Mexico, the lost Inca city of Machu Piccu near Cuzco, Peru,
the Great Walls in China and many more. I have also the chance to visit some of the most artistic buidlings on the face of the earth
such as the St. Peter's Cathedral of Vatican, Taj Mahal in Agra, India and the Opera House in Sydney, Australia. I will never forget my flying
over the mysterious <!WA9><A HREF = "http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/markng/nazca.html">Nazca lines</A>;
my walking (for 2 days) to Nepal from Tibet; my 4 hour custom check (where they have my can sardine X-rayed and
mistook my 1-lt plastic Coke bottle as a missle war head) at the port of Hyfa, Isarel.
My favourite city in the world is Queens Town, New Zeland, which is a town wrap tight by splendid sceneries.
Other cities that fascinate me includes Kathmandu of Nepal, Istanbul of Turkey, La Paz of Bolivia, Jerusalem of Isarel (or for some Palestine, 
or for some, Jordan, I don't really care) and Cairo of Egypt.<BR>

<FONT COLOR = "#ffff00"><H2> What I dislike </H2></FONT>
Don't get me wrong, I do not promote hatred, but am annoyed by behaviour of some...<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME = "SMOKERS">
<FONT COLOR = "#ffff00"><B>Irresponsible smokers</B></FONT><BR>
</A>
As much as I hate people smoking, I can't care less if they lock themselves up at home and smoke till lung cancer get them.
Smokers are generally irresponsible. Not only when they are killing themseleves, they are also 
endangering the lifes of their neighbours, when they smoke in public, not to mention the unpleasant stinky smell they bring about. 
(Yes, smokers, <B>you stink</B>!) Most smokers are irresponsible also in a way that most of them do not dispose of their cigarettes
properly. All they do is throw them on the ground, or worse still, on the lawn or in the bushes, as if they will vapourize
themselves. These people have no concern about someone actually has to pick up their stinky-saliva-filled-little piece of crap up one by one.
Only if one be a little perceptive will notice that the majority of garbage on the ground are cigarettes. You don't see coke can
very often, you don't see candy wrapper very often, but cigarettes are everywhere. My little experiment conducted over
a period of 2 weeks shows that over 99% of garbage I see on the ground are cigarettes. And I just don't understand why someone
would think smokers have style......<BR>

<A NAME = "SHOWOFF">
<FONT COLOR = "#ffff00"><B>Show offs on the net</B></FONT><BR>
</A>
Since you are already surfing the net, why not let me point out what I mean. Many people take advantages of Netscape's features, such as wall
paper, frames, Java support, etc. I never understand why some people who just throw all of these features into their pages, without 
considering whether they would help or not:-<BR>
<FONT COLOR = "#ffffff"><B> Some people are just addicted caffine </B></FONT> - Let me show you
an example <!WA10><A HREF = "http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~nnhung/">here</A> (which is a friend's home page, shhhh, don't tell him what I say here). I have
nothing against what he says in the page, but I think the Java applet he put on is rediculous. First of all, at this stage, Java is still quite
error-prone: his applet crashed my browser many times before I first successfully read his page (and, I am running on a Sparc 5, with ethernet 
connection to his web server!!!). Second, if he wants animation, he could have simply used other existing and more reliable technologies, such as
GIF89A, or Netscape's server-push MIME type. Third, by using Java, not only he has left out web surfers without Java-enabled broswers, he also encourage
impatient people (such as myself) to leave before having his applet downloaded to local site.<BR>
<FONT COLOR = "#ffffff"><B> Please please please use Netscape to view my page </B></FONT> Yea, right, like I care. Many people put the Netscape button
on their page. Do some of them really think that
readers who are surfing the web and have not already gotten Netscape in their machine, would actually download Netscape and install it (which is a pain) 
just for the sake of viewing their page? For those who have the Netscape button in their page, just to facilitate other's in locating Netscape's download
site, I salute their effort. But for those people thinking people would download Netscape to view their pages, I pitty them.<BR>
<FONT COLOR = "#ffffff"><B> Frame your self </B></FONT> - There are just a tremndous amoung of web pages out their with frames features. I personally
think that roughly half of those are rediculous. The idea of franme I suppose is to let user to browse more than one page at a time. In some well
designed pages, they have navigation icons at the bottom or on the sides, which makes navigating through their sites easier. However, in many cases,
these naviagtion help are ignored. People just put frames there for nothing. Not only this will hinder the user from going back and forth, it also
make book marking alot harder...<BR>
But of course, whatever way people choose to design their web pages are their own choices. I have no right to interfere. But I just hate
some of their showing offs.<BR>
