 From Glasner, there are eight stages to creating an image:
    <OL>
      <LI> Generating initial sample points.
      <LI> Evaluating the data at the sample points.
      <LI> Combining the samples with any other samples taken.
      <LI> Testing to determing if sampling is complete.
      <LI> Generating additional sample points if needed.
      <LI> Reconstructing the original signal based on the sampled data.
      <LI> Sampling the reconstruction for the appropriate display.
      <LI> Displaying the image.
    </OL>   <P>    This project addresses each step above by creating a class of objects,
    and several supporting objects, whose purpose is to complete one of
    the eight steps using the ray-tracing framework. <P>    The modularity of this approach allows a user to easily extend any
    specific function of a ray tracer by subclassing one of the
    existing classes and adding the desired functionality.  In this
    manner a user could easily test a new idea, for example, a new jitter 
    method, without having to write an entire ray tracer to test the
    new functions.<P>    I have created three types of objects.  The first is a set of
    objects required in the ray-tracing paradigm.  The second set is a
    group of objects which support the implementation of this
    framework.  Finally, the third set is the objects used in my
    particular test data.<P>    These objects are just for the sampling of the data.  I have
    created an application which produces a PPM file format based on a
    single sample per pixel.<P>
