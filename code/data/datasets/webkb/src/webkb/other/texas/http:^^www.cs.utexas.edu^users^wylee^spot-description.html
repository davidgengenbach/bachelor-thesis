Spot is a Real World Interface robot with a one foot diameter
three-wheeled base and an enclosure for housing twelve sonar
transducers, a power supply, a backplane, an interface board, a sonar
controller board and a 68000 microcomputer.

<p> 
The base has its own microcontroller which accepts translational
and rotational position, velocity and acceleration commands and two
lead-acid gel cells for power supply.

<p>
All its three wheels always face the same direction, so does the
enclosure cage to preserve the relative position of sonar transducers.
Thus, a sonar transducer assigned to be the frontal one is always
facing the direction the robot is facing.

<p>
Its twelve sonar sensors are arranged uniformly in a ring at a height
of approximately one foot from the ground. The other sensors Spot has
are the current and voltage sensors located in the base. The current
sensors can be used as simple bump sensors.
