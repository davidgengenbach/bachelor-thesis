<H1>Rong Tan's Short Reviews</H1>

<H3>Twelve Monkeys</H3>

<P>Everything is out of logic in time travel.  Now we have a event circle
again -- what is the cause and what is the result?  Rather confusing but I like
it.</P>

<H3>Boxing Helena</H3>

<P> Stupid thing.
</P>

<H3>Emma</H3>

<P>Lovely love story!  Many love stories, the funny ones, the weird ones,
and the happy ones.  Gwyneth Paltrow, I should remember this name 'cause
she will be nominated for best actress next year.  Let's see.</P> 

<H3>The Crow: City of Angels</H3>

<P>Impressive visual effect.  With a dark warm hue and misty scenes, it created
a good atmosphere of myst and evilness.</P>  

<H3>Courage Under Fire</H3>

<P>Meg Ryan is a hero!  Is her funny face suitable for a role like this?
Yet this face did bring much humanity and liveliness to the role.
It's an old trick of different people telling different stories.  The plot
was nothing original.</P>

<H3>A Time To Kill</H3>

<P>A black man killed two sons of bitches who raped his little daughter.
He is innocent by our good wills but shouldn't be so by law.  Nonsense.</P>

<H3>Bogus</H3>

<P>What is more beautiful and innocent than a child's imagination?  Try to
wake up yours and see your Bogus!</P>

<H3>Il Postino</H3>

<P>The BEST I have seen since I came to the States.  Ordinary people's
ordinary stories.  The simpliest life and the simpliest feelings with the
most glaring part of humanity.  After all the Hollywood cliches, I felt
like breathing fresh air when I watched this movie. Bravo!</P>

<H3>Fly Away Home</H3>

<P>Just okay.</P>

<H3>Lone Star</H3>

<P>Looks like a low-budget movie.  Yet the way the director mixed up the past
and the present was remarkable and interesting.</P>

<H3>Tombstone</H3>

<P>Another Wyatt Earp story.  I saw Kevin Costner's first but I don't know
which is made first.  Anyway, this one seems better than the overlong Costner
one.</P>

<H3>The Three Muskiteers</H3>

<P>Duma's story itself was just an entertainment story so I don't expect more
from this movie.  A good comedy and not bad as a Tuesday Movie.</P>

<H3>Gentleman's Agreement</H3>

<P>Perhaps it's too old for me to like it.  Maybe the old fashioned acting
doesn't attract me any more?</P>

<H3>Rocky</H3>

<P>Certainly better than the later <I>Rocky</I>s.  The ending made the motif
clear:
What's more important to an ordinary man like Rocky?  It's not winning the
game. Although he had tried so hard to win.  At the last moment, he didn't
care about the result of the game.  He only wanted to say "I love you" to
his girlfriend.</P>

<H3>Three Colors: White</H3>

<P>White has a clearer plot than the other two although it is just the same
weird.  I still prefer <I>Red</I> among the three which is the first one I saw.
</P>

<H3>Terms Of Endearments</H3>

<P>It was only the final part that touched me somehow.</P>

<H3>Gandhi</H3>

<P>Not good as a movie but as a historical fact.  Ben Kinsley was great
playing Gandhi from young to old.</P>

<H3>The Island of Dr. Moreau</H3>

<P>Cool.  This is always my favorite type.  The plot was just a combination
of Jurassic Park and Frankenstein but was still thrilling.  The most remarkable
thing is not the story itself but the issue it raised: what will become after
man is able to create human?  It will be inevitable to develop such a
technology in near future.  As the hyena-man asked, "what am I?"  Dr. Moreau
couldn't answer.  Can anybody answer?</P>

<P>Marlon Brando is perhaps the best actor to play such god-like role. After
his Commander Kurtz in <I>Apocalypse Now</I> and Don Corleone in <I>The 
Godfather</I>, this
Dr. Moreau was not difficult for him.  Another actor is noteworthy, who played
the eyewitness of the island.  David Thewlis, whom I didn't know before, 
acted perfectly as an anti-hero in this film.</P>

<H3>The French Connection</H3>

<P>Not bad.  The chasing scene was outstanding.  Even now in '90s, they still 
seldom
make things better than that.</P>

<H3>Blade Runner</H3>

<P>Said to be classical for its visual effect.  Maybe it is the only thing
that is not bad.  I felt sick.</P>

<H3>The Mirror Has Two Faces</H3>

<P>Very Nice.  Like <I>Emma</I>, it is a romantic comedy.  Healthy humor.
Looks like a low budget movie but the stupid thing is the microphone appeared
in the screen!  The plot isn't perfect but the acting was grrrrreat!</P>
