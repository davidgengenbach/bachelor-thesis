<H1>Physics Problem Solving</H1>
<HR>
The ISAAC program, written in 1975, solves rigid body statics problems
stated in English.  On an IBM RS/6000, it can read, understand, solve,
and draw a diagram for a textbook physics problem in about 1/10 second.

Our more recent research in physics problem solving involves
formalizing a problem that is stated informally and then deriving a
solution from the formal model.  Programs have been written to
understand problems stated by a combination of English
text and a diagram. Our current research involves representation of
the formal models chosen for a problem and selection of appropriate
models for an informally stated problem.
