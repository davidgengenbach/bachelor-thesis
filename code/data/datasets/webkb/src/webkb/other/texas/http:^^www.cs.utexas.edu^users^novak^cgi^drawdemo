<H2>Drawing Program using Interactive X Graphics in Lisp</H2>

This is a demo of the <CODE>draw</CODE> program distributed with the
<!WA0><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/dwindow.html">X Interface for Gnu Common Lisp</a>
which is available as free software under the Gnu General Public License
from <CODE> ftp.ma.utexas.edu </CODE>
<P>
When the demo is started, a drawing window is created.
Two menus are presented: a menu of drawing items and a menu of commands.
Select drawing items and then click the mouse one or more times inside
the drawing area.
<P>
The <CODE>Make LaTeX</CODE> command can be used to create LaTeX commands
to produce the drawing.  <CODE>LaTeX Mode</CODE> will restrict lines to
lines that LaTeX can draw.  Note, however, that LaTeX cannot produce all
the things that can be drawn.  The LaTeX code is served to you in a file
that is presented after the program terminates.
