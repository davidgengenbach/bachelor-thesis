<B> Problem 8 </B>
<P>
This is a demonstration of the Isaac program, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)
program that solves rigid body statics problems stated in English.
<P>
There are 37 problems that are predefined.  You can solve one of
these problems by entering the problem number.
<P>
You can also attempt to solve a new problem.  Enter the text of the new
problem, one sentence per line, in the input area; then select the
"Try New Problem" command.  However, no serious attempt
has been made to make Isaac robust for new problems, so not all
new problems will work.  An example of an underspecified new problem is:
<CODE>What force is required to lift one end of a pole?</CODE>
<P>
When the demo is started, a graphics window and an input window with
a command menu are created.  (You may have to move one of the windows
in order to see them both.)  Click the appropriate menu items to
run the demo.
