Electronic submission of programming assignments (turnin)
<P>
Use the command `turnin' in /p/bin.

Usage:

where `files' is the list of files that you want to submit.
<P>
Please do include the makefile and a README file describing what platform
the makefile is for (Sun4/Solaris/AIX). Use the README file to provide
