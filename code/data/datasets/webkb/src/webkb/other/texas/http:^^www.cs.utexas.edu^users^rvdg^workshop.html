The University of Texas at Austin's Texas Instutute for Computational
and Applied Mathematics, Department of Computer Sciences, High
Performance Computing Facility, and Center for Subsurface
Modeling are organizing a meeting on April 22 and
23 to encourage interaction in the areas of High Performance Parallel
Scientific Computing between the
University of Texas, the major MPP computer vendors, and industry.  
<p> 

This meeting will have three components:
<ul> 
<li>
Presentations from UT researchers on parallel computing related 
research.
<li>
Presentations from vendors and industry on numerical libraries
for, or requiring, parallel computation.
<li>
Round table discussions.
</ul>

<h2> Facilities </h2>

We are in the process of finalizing a block of hotel rooms at the
Double Tree Suites in Austin Texas.  The room charges will be $99 plus
tax.  The block of rooms at this price will be held until 
<b> March 31, 1996 </b>
