<title> New Unity </title>
This directory contains chapters from a manuscript by Jay Misra revising
the UNITY theory. They do not present a completed work, and should be
viewed as such, however they do present new results and are worth exploring
for anyone with an interest in UNITY.<p>

These files are for uncommercial redistribution only.

The following four chapters are available:
<ul>
<li> <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/psp/unity/new_unity/safety.ps.Z">Safety</a>
<li> <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/psp/unity/new_unity/progress.ps.Z">Progress</a>
<li> <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/psp/unity/new_unity/composition.ps.Z">Composition</a>
<li> <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/psp/unity/new_unity/closure.ps.Z">Closure</a>
</ul>

The file <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/psp/unity/new_unity/SafetyProgress.ps.Z">SafetyProgress</a> contains an unpublished journal article
combining the safety and progress chapters, but omitting the exercises.
This might be a good place to start reading about the revised UNITY theory.
