<H1>Current Interests</H1>
</FONT>

<P>
I'm especially interested in topics at the
<A HREF="http://www.informs.org/General/Orms.html">operations research</A>
 / computer science
<A HREF="http://www.math.clemson.edu/INFORMS/CSTS/">interface</A>,
with a particular focus on adaptive heuristics for difficult optimization 
problems in operations management.
My <A HREF="/users/jbc/home/diss.html">dissertation</A> research
specifically addressed the development and application of adaptive
memory strategies for the solution of jobshop and FMS production 
scheduling problems using Tabu Search. Work in this area is continuing.
</P>

<P>
Additional interests include 
software engineering, especially lifecycle strategies and
the application of object oriented methods;
management and applications of distributed information resources,
including nets, webs, and EDI/EC issues; and 
the management of enterprise information technology
and facilities.
</P>
