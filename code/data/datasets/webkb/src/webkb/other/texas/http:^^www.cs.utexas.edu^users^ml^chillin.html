<title>The CHILLIN Inductive Logic Programming System </title>

<h1>CHILLIN</h1> <br> 


CHILLIN is an ILP system which integrates top-down search (a la FOIL), bottom-up
search (a la GOLEM) and predicate invention (a la CHAMP).  It has been used 
as the induction algorithm underlying the CHILL natural-language parser learning
system. <p>

The CHILLIN Prolog code is available via

<blockquote>
This paper describes a new method for inducing logic programs from
examples which attempts to integrate the best aspects of existing ILP
methods into a single coherent framework.  In particular, it combines
a bottom-up method similar to GOLEM with a top-down method similar to
FOIL.  It also includes a method for predicate invention similar to
CHAMP and an elegant solution to the ``noisy oracle'' problem which
allows the system to learn recursive programs without requiring a
complete set of positive examples.  Systematic experimental
comparisons to both GOLEM and FOIL on a range of problems are used to
clearly demonstrate the advantages of the approach.
