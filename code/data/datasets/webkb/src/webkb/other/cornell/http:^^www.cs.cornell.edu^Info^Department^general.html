Ph.D. graduate students</A>, 70 M.Eng students, and graduates about 75
undergraduate C.S. majors each year.  The department is typically ranked
as one of the top five in the country.

Cornell University is located in Ithaca, New York, a city of about 30,000
people in the heart of the Finger Lakes region.  Both Cornell and Ithaca
offer a wide range of cultural activities, sports, and outdoor activities
with the pleasures of both city and country close at hand.
