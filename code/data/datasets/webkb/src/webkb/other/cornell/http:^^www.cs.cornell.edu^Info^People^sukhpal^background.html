I have an interdisciplinary background  comprising Computer Science, 
 High Energy Physics (HEP), and Nonlinear Optics. I have worked in
 two experimental collaborations of physicists, CLEO (Cornell) and
  OPAL (CERN), and have authored and co-authored over 100 research
 papers. But the following  lists of
  publications and invited talks are a good representation of
 my contribution to physics research: <P>

In Nonlinear Optics, I
 studied the propagation of very high intensity electromagnetic waves
 in nonlinear media such as optical fibers in form of optical solitons.
 I constructed and solved
 the equations governing this highly nonlinear dynamics. <P>

 My research work in HEP
 has been in testing the quantum
 theory of
 nuclear force known as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).   
 I conducted my doctoral research while
 working on the OPAL experiment at CERN. My work contributed to what is now
 known as the first clear experimental evidence in support of a salient 
 feature of QCD  that the strength of nuclear force between the nuclear
 particles
 decreases as the particles get closer, the so called Principle of Asymptotic
 Freedom. At CERN, I also managed the 
  off-line data monitoring of the ZED chamber, a part of the OPAL detector
 designed to measure z-coordinates of the particle tracks. <P>
 
 I initiated and carried out the tests of QCD
 during my postdoctoral research work on the CLEO experiment at Wilson
 Laboratory of Nuclear Studies, Cornell
 University. There, I also headed the offline data reconstruction efforts
 for the CLEO collaboration. 
 The complexities in handling these large data sets have given rise to
  an NSF funded collaborative project, 
 <A HREF="http://www.nile.utexas.edu/NC/" > NILE </A>, of computer scientists
   and physicists
   in distributed computing. This is a prime example of how the 
  requirements of HEP
 experiments push on the limits of computer
 technology. (This is also a reason why you should not ask me: what the
 heck are you doing here in Computer Science after earning a PhD
  in Physics?)  <p>

 <H3> If you still see a contradiction between Computics and Physics, 
  translate your questions to:

<UL>

<LI> Why World Wide Web, which is so popular these days among business and
    computer communities, was developed at CERN, the physics Lab? <p>

 <LI> Why the computer was invented, in the first place, for computations
      for physicists?

</B>

 So for me, Computer Science and Physics are the branches of the same tree.
