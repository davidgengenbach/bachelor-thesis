nothing really deep here, but i just really really love rain.  when the
glee club, which is a group i used to sing with here at cornell, went on
tour to the southwest over january, the unremittingly awful (hot and sunny)
weather didn't let up until finally we got to laguna beach (which also had
a lot of pride flags in it.  so i danced and sang in a gorgeous shower on
the pacific (!!!) and in doing so, apparently freaked out the 2.5 people
left in the glee club who didn't already think i was insane.

(*sigh*)

but it remains the case the a nice spring downpour is by far my favorite
weather, bar none.

ithaca</a> is often rainy, which is good.
