<h2>Dilbert</h2>

I am a member of the DNRC. My title is "Minister of Hobgoblins of Little
Minds". This refers to an e-mail I sent Scott Adams about the 4th and 6th
DNRC newsletters. I pointed out a small inconsistency between the newsletters.
Therefore, I am in charge of foolish consistency in the DNRC.<p>

Every day, I read the new Dilbert cartoon on the Dilbert Zone.<p>

<h2>Babylon 5</h2>

Babylon 5 is a science fiction television show produced by Warner Brothers.
They have an
<!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><a href="http://www.wb.com">official web site</a>, though I think the
unofficial
<!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><a href="http://www.hyperion.com/lurk/">Lurker's Guide</a> is the best source
for episode information.<p>

I am a card-carrying member of the Babylon 5 Fan Club. I was also a winner in
the Babylon 5 Mystery Alien Sweepstakes.<p>
