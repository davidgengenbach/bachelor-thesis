<H1>Some CAML Applets for your enjoyment</H1>

<P>
<A HREF="http://pauillac.inria.fr:80/csl">Caml</A> is a high-level
functional language.
The implementation, by the Cristal people at Inria, France, is really
well done, I think.
The <A HREF="http://pauillac.inria.fr:80/~rouaix/mmm">MMM browser</A>
allows you to import Caml bytecode and execute it dynamically.
Caml supports the TK toolkit for the graphical stuff.  The applets below
will only work if you're using the MMM browser.  The browser will popup
dialog boxes asking you to accept or reject "unsigned bytecode".  This is
part of the security mechanism.  You just have to trust me.

you always wanted!).</H2>
