<title> PSSPD: Parallel Solution of Sparse Symmetric Positive
Definite Systems</title>

<P>
PSSPD(Parallel Solution of Sparse Symmetric Positive
Definite Systems) is a sparse matrix package
for solving large, sparse, symmetric positive
systems on distributed-memory machines.
This package is implemented in ANSI C
using double-precision arithmetic.
The Message-Passing Interface(MPI) is used
for communication among processors.

<P>
PSSPD is a parallel direct sparse solver.
It solves a sparse symmetric positive system Ax=b
by computing the sparse Cholesky factorization PAP'=LL',
where P is a permutation matrix.
PSSPD is designed to be run on all processors
in a communicator in parallel.
The sparse matrix A and the right hand side vector b
are distributed among the processors in the communicator.
However, PSSPD doesn't assume any particular data-to-processor
distribution of matrix A or vector b among the processors.
