Wherever there is a pool, there is always a bird.<br>
Wherever there is a school, there always be homework.<br>
Wherever there is a beat, there is always a drum.<br>
Wherever there is a fun, there is always us together.<br>
<br>
The sun will always shinning, the bird will always sing.<br>
As long as there is a fun, there is always a real thing.<br>
The shinning smiling face is always the one.<br>
Wherever there is a fun, there is always us together. <br>

" Sometimes we don't know what part of us<br> 
is to be given to those we love <br>
or whether what we always be giving to<br>
is really needed.<br>
But, the important is we can still love entirely<br>
without completely understanding."
<br>

" The complete understanding of oneself <br>cannot generate the complete love.
<br>The true meaning of life <br>is never meant to be understood completely,<br>it is to love completely. "
