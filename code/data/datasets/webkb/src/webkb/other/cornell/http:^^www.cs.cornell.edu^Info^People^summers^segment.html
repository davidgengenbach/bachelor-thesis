<p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
We present and analyze effficient algorithms for the automated recognition
and interpretation of layout structures in electronic documents.
The key idea is to use the patterns in the distribution of white space
in a document to recognize and interpret its components.  The
recognition algorithm divides the document into a hierarchy of logical
elements; the interpretation algorithms classify these divisions as
base-text, tables, indented lists, polygonal drawings, and graphs.
We present experimental data and discuss an information access application.
Our methodology allows the automatic markup of documents and the creation
of multi-level indices and browsing tools for electronic libraries.</p>
