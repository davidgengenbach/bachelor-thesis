<center><p><h1>some of my writings</h1></center><p>
i've not had much published, but i have written some things i'm proud
of.  some of them have been flames of mine, and others have been more
thought out.  as a conscientious objector to all armed conflict, my
first published letter was published in the grand rapids press a few
years back during the gulf war.  since that time, however, i've
started keeping more of my work online.<p>

lest you wonder, i also do write poetry and other things.  but i'd
probably rather be famous as an essayist anyhow--i like to argue.<p>

so here's some of my writings:
<ul>
<li>there's a dreadful mess going on in byron center, which is a
suburb 5 miles from where i went to high school.  so i wrote <a href =
"Letters/byron.txt">a letter</a>.
<li>the unabomber suspect was a mathematician.  so all mathematicians
are suspected terrorists?  i don't think so...so i wrote <a href =
"Letters/unabomber.txt">a letter</a> to the editor of my newspaper.
<li>my most widely read <a href = "Letters/utne.txt">letter</a> almost
certainly was a letter i had published in utne reader a while back.
<li>this is <a href = "Letters/utne2.txt">a letter</a> i sent them with which i was
much more proud.  no accounting for taste.
<li>i had <a href = "Letters/tech.txt">a letter</a> printed in <a href =
"http://www.the-tech.mit.edu">the tech</a> a couple years back, about
the undergraduate association at mit.  
<li>i also published <a href = "Letters/tech2.txt">a letter</a> in the same
newspaper, regarding gay and lesbian issues.
<li>i'm in the process of writing <a href = "Letters/rotc.txt">a letter</a> on
rotc policies at cornell.
<li>i wrote <a href = "Letters/cornell-review.txt">a bitchy letter</a> to the
cornell review recently.  what humorless schmucks.
</ul>
and yes, i like to argue.
