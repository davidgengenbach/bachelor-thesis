<h2> Pre-requisites for CS 537</h2>

<HR>
The following are prerequisites for the course. If you feel you do not
meet one or more of these, please contact me (praveen@cs) to discuss
whether you should enroll for the course.
<ul>

<li> Knowledge of the basics of relational database systems, as taught
in CS 432. The broad topics that you should have at least a passing 
familiarity with are the relational data model, the relational algebra
and calculus, SQL, file structures (heap and isam) and 
indexing structures (B-tree). These will be very briefly covered
again at the start of the course.

<li> Ability to program with C++. The projects for the course will involve
adding code to a database system written in C++. If you have experience
writing C code, you might feel that you can pick up C++. Some of the
C++ background info in the course home page might help you. If you have
never programmed in C or C++, you should talk with me before enrolling
for the course. Also, take a look at the information on the term project,
to get an idea of what sort of programming is required.

<li> Introductory courses in data structures(CS 410 or equiv) and
operating systems.
</ul>
