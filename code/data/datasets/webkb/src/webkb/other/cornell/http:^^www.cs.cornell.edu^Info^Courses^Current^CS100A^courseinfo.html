CS 100 is a 4 credit course that introduces fundamental computer programming and problem-solving concepts.  Programming projects are written in the programming language C.  Some assignments will also use Matlab.  CS 100 assumes no prior knowledge of computing and has no prerequisite computer science courses.  (However,a majority of the students in recent years have had some programming experience prior to taking CS100.)  The course may be taken for a letter grade or, if your college or program advisor allows it, S/U<P>

	<B>*</B>Section 5 meeting at 2:30 on Tuesday has been canceled.  If you are registered for that section, you should attend section 3 instead.<BR>
	Sections are a required part of the course used to clarify topics covered in lecture, discuss programming problems, and work additional problems and exercises.  Graded programs and exams are returned in sections and sample solutions and practice exams are handed out there.  <BR>
	All sections for CS 100A each week will cover the same topics.  However, there will be some variations in problems and exercises depending on the instructor and the interests of the students in each section.<P>
	<LI><B>Computing Facilities:</B><BR>
	Programming assignments will use Metrowerks' CodeWarrior C/C++ programming environment on Macintosh computers.  The computer room in the basement of Carpenter Hall is the primary lab for CS 100.  CS 100 students have priority in this lab, and this is where you will find CS 100 consultants, extra copies of handouts, unclaimed work, and posted announcements and grades.   There are around 40 Macintosh IIci computers in the Carpenter lab, each with 12MB of main memory and a 250 MB hard disk running Apple's  System 7.5.  The Carpenter lab is open when the Engineering library is.  Normal hours are:<BR>
		<UL>
			<LI>Mon-Thurs. 8:00am - 10:50pm
			<LI>Fri. 8:00am - 5:50pm
			<LI>Sat. 10:00am - 5:50pm
			<LI>Sun. 1:00pm - 10:50pm
		</UL>
	<BR>Hours will be restricted during vacations and university holidays.<BR>
	Although Carpenter is the primary lab for CS 100, CodeWarrior is available on all of CIT's public Macintoshes that have enough disk space and RAM to support it.  During peak periods you may want to use a machine at another location to avoid long lines in Carpenter.<BR>
	<EM>No food or drink is allowed in the computer labs</EM>  Please keep the area clean and recycle.<P>
	<LI><B>Consultants:</B><BR>
	On duty in the Carpenter Hall basement daily and most evenings starting Aug. 29.  The exact schedule will be announced in class and posted in Carpenter.  Consultants will:
	<UL>
		<LI>Help you find program errors.  Consultants will <B>not</B> fix your programs for you; they will suggest how <I>you</I> can find errors and fix them yourself.
		<LI>Receive assignments
		<LI>Return prelims and programs that were not picked up in sections.  (Bring you ID card with you when you pick up an exam)
		<LI>Receive regrade requests
		<LI>Provide tutoring, but <B>only</B> during slack periods.

	The readings listed in the syllabi are suggested readings to help you follow the lectures and section material.  Exams in CS 100 are not based on the reading list; they are based on material covered in lectures, sections, and assignments.  You are not "responsible" for material in the book that is not covered in class.<P>	
	<LI><B>Handouts:</B><BR>
	Distributed in class.  A limited # of extra copies will be available in Carpenter.

	<LI><B>Software:</B><BR>
	Cornell Information Technologies (CIT) provides Metrowerks CodeWarrior and Matlab on all of its public Macintosh computers.  To access Matlab, you will be given a user name and password (all students in CS 100 use the same user name and password).  Do not give this password to others.  Do not forget the password.  The course staff has been instructed not to give the password to anyone. If you forget it, you will have to see your instructor.<P>
	
	<LI><B>Disks:</B><BR>
	You will need a few 3.5 inch floppy disks for your programming assignments.  No student files may be left on CIT's public machines (they are cleanedout every day).  You must store your files on your own floppy disks.  You also should keep back-up copies of all your work on separate disks.
