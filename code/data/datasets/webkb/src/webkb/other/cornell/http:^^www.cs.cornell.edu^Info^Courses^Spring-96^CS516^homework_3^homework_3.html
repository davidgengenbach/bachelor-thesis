<center>  </B>Handed out: Tue, Feb 27th</center>
<center>  Due: Thu, Mar 7th</center>
<P>  
<P>  This assignment <B>must</B> be done in <B>groups of two </B>with a<B> different partner </B>than homework 1 or 2.Hand in one solution per group (printed, not manuscript).
<P>  
<H1> 1  Heat diffusion - this time using MPI</H1>
<P>  Rewrite your heat diffusion simulation using MPI. Alternatively, you may develop any similar application using MPI.
<P>  Compare the "ease" of programming as well as the performance of the two implementations. It might be nice to divide the running time up into a "communication time" and a "computation time", if possible, and use these timings to compare the two implementations.
