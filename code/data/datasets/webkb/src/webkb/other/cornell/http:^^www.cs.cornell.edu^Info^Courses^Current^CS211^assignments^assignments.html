<H1> Assignments </H1> 

<P> All assignments are due at the beginning of the lecture on the day
specified, before the lecture starts.<em> No late assignments will be
accepted.</em>  You must work on all assignments alone, unless
specifically stated otherwise in the  assignment. Assignments
contribute a large fraction of your grade, so  do them.  
</P> 

<P>
Graded work will be available in the consulting office, Upson 305, and
will be handed back in class. If you disagree with the way an
assignment has been graded, you may submit it for regrade. To do so,
fill out a regrade form (available on the rack outside Upson 303) and
staple it to your assignment. Leave the assignment in the CS211
mailbox in Upson 303. You have one week after an assignment is
returned to submit a regrade.
</P>


<P>
 IMPORTANT : Always check the the notes besides the assignments
for corrections and hints.
