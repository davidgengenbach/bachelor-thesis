<li>First, breathe deeply. Sit down. Whisper your favorite magic incantation.
Only then proceed reading.<p>

<li>You enter the Course Materials by following a regular looking
link, except that the URL will look a little funny. Example:
<!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Annotation/Get/cs314_f95_index">link to CS314 course materials</a>.<p>

<li>You will be asked for your id and your annotation password.  You will
have gotten (or soon get) these.<p>

<li>The documents you will see have annotation points which are marked
by a link "You may add an Annotation". Clicking on that link will bring
up a form into which you can type a text. The subject line will show
up in the original document, so choose it well.<p>

<li>Existing annotations are placed just above the "You may add an Annotation".
A small icon tells you whether each annotation was made by a student or
by course staff. You can respond to existing annotations, this is similar
to responding to a posting in a newsgroup.<p>

<li>Now whisper the magic incantation again, take another deep breath,
and try it out!<p>

</ol>
