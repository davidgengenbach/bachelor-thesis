<h2> CS100 Program 6 </h2>

<strong> Due: </strong> Tuesday, April 30, 1996. <p>

<h3> Program 6 Notes </h3>

<P>
 There is a built-in function named "fabs" that computes the absolute
value function on doubles, which you will probably want to use.  There
is a function called "abs" as well, but this one has an integer
argument.  </P>

<P> In the Program 6 folder there is a file called "tests" which
describes some additional tests you should run and hand in for Part 2,
along with the answers that should be produced.  </P>
