<p>
The goal of our research group is to make multimedia data first class
data types in our computing environment. To this end, we are building
technologies supporting the storage, communication, and processing of
multimedia data.  In contrast to other commercial and research
approaches, which require specialized hardware, operating systems, or
networks to be usable, the technologies we are designing fit into the
current research environment.  Our premise is that the current
hardware, software, and communication infrastructure is sufficient to
support research into continuous media systems and applications.  We
are verifying this hypothesis by building working systems.

<h3>Our Approach to Research</h3>
<p>
Our group uses an <i>systems</i> approach to building applications.  We
find &quot;killer applications&quot; that can almost be built using the
current technology, and try to build them.  In doing so, we inevitably
find components of the application that require new algorithms, we
optimize interactions between the components, and we build frameworks
for combining the components.  The value in such research is in the
study of the interaction between components, the occasional creation of
component technologies, and the spin-off technologies that result.
Examples of such spin-offs are <!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/zeno/Projects/Tcl-DP.html"> Tcl-DP</a>
and the Berkeley MPEG player (both of which were developed while building
<!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><a href="http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/projects/cmt/">CMT</a>).
