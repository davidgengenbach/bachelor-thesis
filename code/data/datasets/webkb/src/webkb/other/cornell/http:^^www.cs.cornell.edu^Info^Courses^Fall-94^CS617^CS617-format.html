<h1>CS 617 Course Format</h1> 
<h2>Thorsten von Eicken</h2>
<h3>Fall, 1994</h3>
<hr>
<br>
The entire course will have a little ''research flair'' to it which means 
that few things more than two years old will be discussed. The down-side 
is that no textbook is available to complement the course. I am still 
searching for a good introductory parallel programming book and would 
appreciate any recommendations. The material presented in class will 
however be complemented with conference and journal papers.
<p>
Weekly problem sets will provide an opportunity to let the material 
presented in class ''sink in''. Accounts on the NCSA CM-5 for this purpose 
should be available shortly. I am also purchasing a small cluster of 
SPARCstation-20's connected by an ATM network which I hope to make 
available by the end of september. This platform will be significantly 
more shaky than the CM-5, but it will offer the opportunity to dig much 
deeper into the system.
<p>
Towards the second half of the term (right after Columbus day) we will 
form small groups to start projects. The basic mindset you should have is 
that you are writing for an upcoming conference. You should end-up with a 
report of 10-15 double-spaced pages. You will have to innovate beyond 
existing work, as represented by a few recent papers, and provide 
evidence—typically in the form of data collected from experiments—to 
justify the innovation. The relative weighting of synthesis and analysis 
depends on your preferences but neither should have zero weight. Design 
studies are great; so is gathering relevant facts.
<p>
In my view this is an ''advanced topics'' course intended to provide food 
for thought. In your project, you can extend any of the topics presented 
in class, dig into issues encountered in the homeworks, integrate 
disparate approaches, or pick-up on systems issues not covered in the 
course. I hope that the ATM cluster, in particular, will offer ample 
ground for coming up with new ideas and testing them out.
<p>
At the end of the course you will have the opportunity to present your 
project to the entire class (and others in the department) in a poster 
session: each group prepares a 3'x4' poster with text and diagrams 
explaining the project. During the poster session, you will have 5–10 
minutes to present your project, and you will get to know what others did. 
Take a look at the CS516 posters in front of my office to get an idea (I 
expect this terms posters to be even better!)
<p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

Basic familiarity with parallel computing (message passing, data parallel, 
shared memory programming models) OR basic familiarity with computer 
systems (processor pipeline, assembly language, memory hierarchy, virtual 
memory system, thread packages, system calls)
<p>
This course will require significant breadth knowledge. Not everyone is 
expected to know everything. Problem sets and projects will be done in 
groups. You are expected to catch-up on the topics you feel less 
comfortable with and I will adapt the lectures to the average knowledge. 
The bottom line is that if you are determined to learn (and have the 
time!), you are welcome to the course.

<h2>Grading</h2>

The problem sets and the term project will be done in groups of two and 
you must choose a different partner for each of the three first problem 
sets. The problem sets are graded: I expect you to take a serious crack at 
each of the problems and to turn-in a well-rounded solution for one 
problem per set. The final grade will roughly be composed of: 40% problem 
sets, 40% project report, 10% project presentation, 10% class 
participation.
