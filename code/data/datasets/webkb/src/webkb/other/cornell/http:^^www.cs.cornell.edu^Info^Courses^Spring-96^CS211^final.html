<TITLE> Topics for the final exam </TITLE>

<PRE>
Topics for the final exam.  Everything on prelims 1 and 2 plus:

I. PowerPlant
        + Any question about PowerPlant will be based on the assignment
II. Linked lists
        + Data structures for linked lists
        + Inserting/deleting/searching
        + Inserting into a sorted list
        + Doubly linked lists
        + Lists with header nodes
        + Circular lists
III. Analysis of algorithms
        + Definition of big-O
        + What it means for an algorithm to be O(n), O(n^2), O(log n), etc.
        + Comparison of different implementations
		- examples:
		- linked lists vs. arrays vs. trees
		- binary search vs. linear search
IV. Binary Trees
        + Definition of a binary tree (root, children, parents, leaf, etc.)
        + Linear representation of trees
        + Preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals
        + Binary search tree
V. Putting Linked Data Structures into Classes (example)
VI. Inline, assert, exception handling, templates
        + You should understand these at a high level, i.e. understand
          the lecture notes
VII. Java
        + You should understand how Java differs from C++ at a high level

The final is *comprehensive*.  Although the most recent stuff will
weigh a bit heavier, anything is fair game.
