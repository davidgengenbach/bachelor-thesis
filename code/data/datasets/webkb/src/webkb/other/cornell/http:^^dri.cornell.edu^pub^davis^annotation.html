<blockquote>
The annotation system is an experiment in how people can collaborate
when working with a set of shared documents.  It allows a group of
people to share a set of documents and to make comments about the
documents which are shared with the other members of the group.  An
annotation to a document is a comment on or question about the
document.  Annotations can also refer to other annotations. For
example, they can answer questions or refute arguments.

<DD> An example of CoNote taken from a problem set from
the Fall 1994 course CS212.  You can't add notes here, but you
can see a realistic example.  Note that this example is taken from the middle of a problem set, so you won't see the context that the students did see.  The names have been changed to protect privacy.

<h4>Help wanted</h4>

I would also like to have someone re-implement it to be faster.
