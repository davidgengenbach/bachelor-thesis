During the <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigmm">ACM SIGMM </A>business
meeting of the <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigmm/MM95/">1995 ACM Multimedia conference</A>,
interest was expressed in developing a standard syllabus for multimedia
education. This web site is a first step in that direction. It
contains pointers to on-line information that is useful to those
of us developing courses in multimedia.
