Sometimes, as one is confined to such a small area for such an
extended period of time, the mind wanders.  This picture is the result
of such a phenomena.  Early one morning (4 AM), Jeff, Will, and I
decided to put all of the multimedia equipment that we're surrounded 
with on a daily basis to good use.  The result, much to our pleasure,
was both inventive, stress-alleviating, and exciting!  Not to mention
that we now had some customized pixs to put on the net to show just
how "interesting" we could be as individuals.<p>

I graduated in May 1995 from the <!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><A HREF="http://mosaic.cc.geneseo.edu">

Geneseo was a really great school to go to! I met some really great

Currently, I'm working for the Campus Life department as a Graduate 
Residence Assistant in Schuyler House, which is conveniently located on
the Southern <em>outskirts</EM> of campus.  <br>

University, where I maintain an active position on the pledge team.<p>
