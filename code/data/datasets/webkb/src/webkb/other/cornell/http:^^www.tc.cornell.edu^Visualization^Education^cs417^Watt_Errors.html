<h2>
Errata for Watt, "3D Computer Graphics" 
<br> Second Edition, Addison Wesley
</h2> 
The bulleted numbers refer to page number.
<p>
<ul>
<li>18 <br>
The first equation on the page has two mistakes. V^2 should read |V|^2.
Also VW should read V dot W.
<p>
<li>60<br>
The third row, second column entry of T_view should be sin(phi) not sin(theta).
<p>
<li>62 <br> The first 4x4 matrix is incorrect. It is not orthonormal 
and thus cannot be the product of two rotations.
<p>
<li>72<br> The second constraint in the middle of the page should read:
"Normalizing the range of zs values so that the range of 
d<=zv<=f maps into the range 0<=zs<=1."
<p>
<li>73<br> Matrix equation (3.1) has an incorrect last COLUMN. It should read
[0,0,1,0].
<p>
<li>100<br> H=(L+V)/2 should read H=norm(L+V).
<p>
<li>116<br> Equation (4.8) should have a set of brackets so that 
the "1/2" multiplies the entire expression.
<p>
<li>117<br> Figure 4.27 is confusing at best. I think that the N vector 
should be H and the R vector should be V.
<p>
<li>118<br> The third equation on the page gives mu as a function of Fo. 
The mu should be eta, the index of refraction. The equation is just 
a rearranged version of the one above it.
<p>
<li>118<br> The second numbered bullet should read: "These values of eta ... "
<p>
<li>120<br>
  Note that in the code the index of refraction is refered to as "mu". 
<p>
<li>130<br>
In figure 5.4 the notation "Nt dot (P(t)-X)<0 implies S in inside" should read
"F is inside".
<p>
<li>138<br> In Equation (5.2), the last "y2" in the equation for Nb 
should be "ys". The "Ns" on the right of the equation for Ns should be "Na".
<p>
<li>187<br> In Figure 6.21 the parametric directions u and v are reversed.
