I work with <a href="/Info/Department/Annual94/Faculty/Van_Loan.html">
Charles Van Loan</a>. My thesis deals with the <a
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Kronecker.html">
Kronecker</a> product of matrices. More specifically I am looking at

<ul> 
<li> Approximating a matrix with the Kronecker product of a pair
of matrices.  
<li> Expressing FFT and Wavelet algorithms using the
Kronecker product notation.  
<li> Automatically implementing signal
processing algorithms that use the Kronecker product, via symbolic
manipulation and program transformations. 
</ul>
<hr>
I plan on providing access to my system that generates efficient FFT
code for different languages and systems via the WWW. 
For the moment, *only* the input form is working and no code is generated.<br> 
<a href="fft.html">Please have a look</a>.

<p>
In general, I am interested in numerical linear algebra and parallelization;
use of symbolic math and compiler techniques for optimization; 
FFTs; wavelets; simulation; high performance and scientific computing.
