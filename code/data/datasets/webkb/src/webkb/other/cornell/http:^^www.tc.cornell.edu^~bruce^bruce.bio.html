Bruce Land is the Project Leader of the Visualization group 
at the Cornell Theory Center. The group deals with 
development of visualization techniques and their 
application to scientific data. He also teaches in the 
Computer Science Department at Cornell where he is a senior
research associate.

Land received a Ph.D. in neurobiology in 1976 from Cornell 
University, and a BS in physics from Harvey Mudd College 
in 1968.  He was a lecturer in the Neurobiology Department 
at Cornell for ten years and did research on coupling of activity 
at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction, both experimentally 
and by computer modeling.  During this time, he taught in 
the Electrical Engineering department at Cornell for two years.  
He came to the Cornell Theory Center in 1986 as a 
Computational Research Associate, then started supporting 
graphics and animation in 1987.  In 1992 he started teaching 
an introductory graphics course in the CS department at Cornell.
