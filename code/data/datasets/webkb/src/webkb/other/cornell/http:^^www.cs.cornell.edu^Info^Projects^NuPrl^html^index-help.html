<H2> System Requirements </H2>
To use the Nuprl/WWW Browser, you must have a World Wide Web client (HTML
browser) that can display inlined GIF and XBM format images and supports
HTML Fill-Out Forms. NCSA Mosaic for X-Windows is one such client.

<H2> WARNING: A WORD ABOUT SPEED </H2>
The Nuprl system is large, complex, and can be consequently slow to
retrieve and expand proof information. The Nuprl/WWW Browser system must
format this information into images and HTML pages before returning it to
you, the user. Finally, we are all at the mercy of Internet delays between
our server and your Web client. <b>Consequently, some operations in the
Nuprl/WWW Browser may take several <i>minutes</i> to complete.</b>
Succedent accesses to the same pages may be faster if your client caches
images. <P>

Each page generated by the Browser has a hypertext link at the bottom to
