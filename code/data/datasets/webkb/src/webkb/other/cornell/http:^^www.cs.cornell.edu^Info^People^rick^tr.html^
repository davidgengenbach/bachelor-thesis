<dt> IMACS-94 -- <A HREF="tech-reports/imacs94.ps"> Physical Elements:
Using chains and cell complexes to solve multiple domain PDE problems
</A> A brief description of how <IMG
SRC="/Info/Projects/SimLab/images/ChainsText2.gif"> has been used to
encode a Lax-Wendroff approximation to the 1D Euler Equations of fluid
flow.

<dt> TR94-1406 -- <A HREF="tech-reports/TR94-1406.ps"> Chain Models
and Finite Element Analysis </A> Shows how <IMG
SRC="/Info/Projects/SimLab/images/ChainsText2.gif"> is a "programming
language for FEM," by developing a three page executable encoding of a
finite element approximation to plane stress using quadratic shape
functions defined over triangles.

<DT>TR93-1375 -- <A HREF="tech-reports/TR93-1375.ps"> Chain Models of
Physical Behavior for Engineering Analysis and Design </A> Suggests
that because computers have a preeminent role in engineering analysis
today, <I>computation</I> needs to be explicitly addressed in
mathematical models of engineering systems, and proposes a methodology
for doing this based on algebraic topological concepts.

<DT>TR92-1246 -- <A HREF="tech-reports/TR92-1246.ps"> SimLab:
Automatically Creating Physical Systems Simulators </A>

Describes a computer environment for creation lumped model simulators
from high level specifications.

<DT>ASME-WAM92 -- <A HREF="tech-reports/ASME-WAM92.ps">
1992 ASME Winter Annual Meeting SimLab Paper </A>

A later version of TR92-1246 that includes examples from electrical
circuits, rigid body dynamics, etc.
