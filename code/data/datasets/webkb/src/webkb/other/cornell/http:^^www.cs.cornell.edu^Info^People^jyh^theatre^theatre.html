<h1>Cornell Center for the Theatre Arts, Jason's page</h1>
<p>

I help organize a group of Computer Science people interested in the
theatre (specifically the <em>Cornell Center for the Theatre
Arts</em>).  We buy a block of season tickets, and I pass them out
during the year.  If someone can't make it on one of the days we've
bought tickets for, then I help them sell their old ticket and buy a
new one.  We also have a few extra tickets this year, for friends.
Each ticket costs $5 (the season subscription was $30).  If you are
known to me or the Cornell Computer Science department, and you are
interested in the theatre, send me mail (jyh@cs.cornell.edu), and I'll
include you in further mailings.

<h2>Season events for '95-'96 (Power plays)</h2>
<p>

Seats are reserved in the main (Proscenium) theatre, and they're open
in the Flexible theatre.

<p>
<h3>The Importance of Being Earnest</h3>
<em>Oscar Wilde, Proscenium theatre</em>
<p>
In this witty and satirical comedy, two young men seek the hands of
two young ladies despite numerous obstaces--including the fact that
the ladies can only love a man named Ernest.  This 1895 masterpiece is
one of the most delightful comedies of all time--complete with
manufactured mistaken identity, fractured romances, and upended
social conventions.
<p>
<em>Plays Septermber 21-30; we have tickets for September 23 and 28</em>.

<p>
<h3>Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and Other Identites</h3>
<em>Anna Deveare Smith, Flexible theatre</em>
<p>
A searing look at two cultures living in Crown Heights, Brooklyn in
1991.  A young black child is killed when a Hasidic man's car jumps a
curb.  An Hasidic Rabbinical student is stabbed and killed in an act
of retaliation.  The ensuing riots wracked a community previously
praised for its atmosphere of tolerance and diversity.  Drawing from
over 50 interviews with Crown Heights residents--politicans,
activists, religious leaders, victims and perpetrators, Fires in the
Mirror acheives a compelling and sophisticated view of racial and
class conflict.
<p>
<em>Plays October 19-29; we have tickets for October 21 and 26</em>.

<p>

<h3>Measure for Measure</h3>
<em>William Shakespeare, Proscenium theatre</em>
<p>
Shakespeare's most direct exploration of the uses and abuses of power.
In bawdy Vienna, the young Isabella must plead for the life of her
condemned brother, whose fate is in the hands of Angelo.  Though he
administers the law with utmost morality, Angelo finds he desires
Isabella and offers her brother's life in echange for possesing her.
Isabella must choose between her love for her brother and her own
honor.
<p>
<em>Plays November 16-December 2; we have tickets for November
18 and 30</em>.

<p>
<h3>Oleanna</h3>
<em>David Mamet, Film forum</em>
<p>
A male university professor and his female student meet to discuss her
performancs in his class and soon become players in a fierce
interrogation of political correctness, mechanisms of power,
censorship, and abuse.  From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of
"Glenngarry Glen Ross", "The Verdict", and "Speed-the-Plow", Oleanna
is at once direct, provocative, and incendiary.
<p>

Exciting, original choreography performed by Cornell faculty and

<h3>Dance Alloy</h3>
<em>Proscenium Theatre</em>
<p>
Artistic Director Mark Taylor and Dance Alloy have become the defining
force in Pittsburgh's contemporary dance scene, with dance that is
elegant, original, and daring.  Brought to life by the strength and
grace of the Alloy dancers who explore the limits of human movement,
these dances are both physically charged and visually complex.
