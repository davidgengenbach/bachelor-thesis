<TITLE>CS212 Web Browser Caching</TITLE>
<hr>
Web browser's cache previously viewed Web pages.  In general, to make sure you have the most recent version of a page you can hit RELOAD in your browser (e.g., you should do this when looking at pages in CoNote in order to see new postings).
<P>
For some reason, reloading a Java applet does not necessarily get all the files that changed from the server.  At least under Netscape Navigator this can produce an inconsistent NOODLLE if any of its files have changed.  In order to make sure this is not happening to you, you can clear both the memory and the disk cache.  Safest is to start a fresh Netscape process and then to clear the disk cache (which persists across invocations of Netscape).  In order to clear the caches, go to the Options menu and select Network Preferences, there is a Cache tab in the dialog box.  This is only necessary when NOODLLE is changed, and you see strange behavior of the interpreter.
