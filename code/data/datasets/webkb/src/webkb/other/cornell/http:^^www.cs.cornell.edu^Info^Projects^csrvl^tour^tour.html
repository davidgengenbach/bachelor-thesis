<title>Tour of the CSRVL</title>

<h1>Tour the CSRVL</h1>

Here is a sequence of images captured from a video walk-through
of the CSRVL. Believe it or not, this is more or less how the lab
looks on a daily basis. These are all 8-bit GIF files, about 68K
each.

<p>
The CSRVL consists of two adjoining rooms on the 3rd floor of Upson
Hall at Cornell University. The main lab is used by faculty and students
involved in research in robotics and machine vision. Therein can be
found all of the equipment needed to build, test, debug, and run
experiments with our mobile robots, along with a number of workstations
and personal computers used in machine vision processing as well for
programming the mobots.

<p>
The teaching lab is used by undergraduate and graduate students taking
courses in robotics and vision. These include CS463, an undergraduate
course in vision and robotics, and CS664, a graduate seminar in machine
vision. The teaching lab contains a dozen Sparc IPX and IPC machines
for use by these students, as well as the Puma and Zebra robotic arms.
