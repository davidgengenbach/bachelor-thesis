i listen to a lot of music, and also enjoy performing oratorios in
formal choruses.  

<p>
while it seems ridiculous sometimes to make this distinction, i listen to
some very different types of music:
<ul>
<li><a href = "classical.html">classical</a>, including contemporary art
music
<li><a href = "techno.html">electronic</a>, including "trance," "ambient,"
and "techno"
<li><a href = "other.html">other</a>, including synth-pop, showtunes, and,
well, other.
</ul>
sorta a shame we have to make these distinctions.
