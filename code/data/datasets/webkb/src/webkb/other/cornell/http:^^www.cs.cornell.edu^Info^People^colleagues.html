<h1>Research Colleagues of the CS Department</h1>

We have a <a href="/Info/Department/list_of_people.line"> directory
listing</a> of all the people in the department, giving the email
address, office number, and phone number for each person.
<p>
You can find out more about individual research colleagues
of the department by accessing their home pages.
These are the Colleagues, some of whom are former students, who are
working with Cornell CS Faculty and Researchers and have home pages.
