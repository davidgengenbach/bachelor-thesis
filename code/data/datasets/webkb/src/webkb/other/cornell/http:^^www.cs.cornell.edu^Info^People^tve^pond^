Somehow during the spring of '95 I felt compelled to do some real
<img src="1-sml.gif" align=right hspace=10 vspace=5>
digging and building, as opposed to digging up bugs and building
vaporware. The house and garden offered plenty of opportunities for
such entertainment and I had to decide on where to start with
remodeling.<p>

We had been bothered by the noise from the road passing in
front of the house while sitting in our covered porch for a while, so
fixing that seemed like a good idea. We decided to build a solid fence
to screen the porch from the cars and to place a retaining wall
extending the down-hill wall of the house to the property line. This
would form a level "patio" around the porch which we wanted to
landscape in a japanese style.

I started drawing plans, buying wood, and then digging. During some
evening, after a sweaty day digging, sawing and hammering, we looked
into one too many gardening books and got bitten by the pond bug. The
perspective of having a nice surface of water with beautiful water plants
right there in front of our porch sounded just too wonderful. It then
occurred to me that I could relatively easily adapt the construction to
create a pond: I only needed to dig a bit deeper, or so I thought.

Well, it turned out to be a little more involved than that! First I had
to reinforce the whole construction a bit to make sure it would not
yield under the weight of the water. And then the whole process of
lining the pond took a lot more time than filling the hole behind the
retaining wall with dirt would have.<p>

I had the wise idea to take a couple of pictures during the constrution
which I'm making available here. You might wonder why I do this.  Well,
very simply because I found <a

Page</a> very inspiring and helpful while planning the construction of
my own pond. So I hope that others get inspired seeing my pond and find
it helpful to see how someone else did things.<p>
