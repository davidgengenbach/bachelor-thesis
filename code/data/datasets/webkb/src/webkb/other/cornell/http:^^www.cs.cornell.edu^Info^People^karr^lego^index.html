<p>
I used to get an occasional question about why I created this Web site.
<!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/karr/lego/why&.html">See my explanation on its own Web page</a>.

<p>
This is where I show photographs of my own LEGO&#174; designs.
Most of these are fairly recent, since unfortunately I have very
little evidence left of any of my childhood work.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays I design most of my models for use with minifigures, but
adapting from the style that I developed over many years around the
figures I built myself because they were the only ones available.
Look at the following pages for complete discussion
and links to the images of the models:
<ul>
<li>My
<!WA24><!WA24><!WA24><!WA24><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/karr/lego/veh/index.html">vehicle collection</a>.
Includes a sports car, dump truck, motorcycle with sidecar,
and a large old-fashioned sedan.
</li>
<li>My 
<!WA25><!WA25><!WA25><!WA25><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/karr/lego/air/index.html">aircraft collection</a>.
Includes models of two airplanes styled after World War I fighters.

<li>My
<!WA26><!WA26><!WA26><!WA26><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/karr/lego/space/index.html">space collection</a>.
Includes a space cruiser with a cabin for five, and an unmanned rocket.

<li>My
<!WA27><!WA27><!WA27><!WA27><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/karr/lego/train/index.html">rail road collection</a>.
Includes old and new editions of my favorite steam locomotive, and
a passenger car to go with it.
</li>
<li>My
<!WA28><!WA28><!WA28><!WA28><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/karr/lego/water/index.html">ship collection</a>.
Currently includes only an oil tanker, but that's plenty.

<p>
My daughters, Jane and Polly, have put together quite a number of
models of their own, and have added important enhancements to some
models I put together.  I think some of these designs and enhancements
give insight into the way young children play with LEGO&#174;.

<p>
It seems impossible to keep up with all the wonderful LEGO&#174; models
that people have posted on the World Wide Web, but take a look at
<!WA39><!WA39><!WA39><!WA39><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/karr/lego/other.html">my links to a few of my favorites</a>,
including an animation of a walking ``spider,'' a complete two-story
house, a large red dragon, a 1959 Cadillac convertible,
and several other beautifully finished models.

<p>
To try to sort through the many available Web pages, I've very
roughly categorized them as follows:
<ul>
<li><!WA41><!WA41><!WA41><!WA41><a href="#b1">High-Level Information Servers</a></li>
<li><!WA42><!WA42><!WA42><!WA42><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/karr/lego/academia.html">Academic Web Sites</a>

    (on a separate page)</li>
<li><!WA46><!WA46><!WA46><!WA46><a href="#b6">Miscellaneous Good Stuff</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3><a name="b1">High-Level Information Servers</a></h3>

<p>
Here are some servers that I think most people will want to see.

<dl>
<dt><!WA47><!WA47><!WA47><!WA47><a name="legocom" href="http://www.lego.com/"
>The Official LEGO&#174; World Wide Web Site</a>.
<dd>
Yes, the LEGO Group has been on the Web officially 
since March 22, 1996.  
They have here a page with some blurbs about their product line, along
with some very interesting historical information (with pictures!),
information about caring for or replacing your LEGO&#174; bricks, 
a discussion of trademarks and related issues, and press releases.

<dt><!WA48><!WA48><!WA48><!WA48><a name="earthsea" href="ftp://blah.math.tu-graz.ac.at/pub/lego"
>The LEGO&#174; FTP archive</a>.
<dd>
The FTP archive is a very extensive collection of files
assembled by <!WA49><!WA49><!WA49><!WA49><a href="http://www.rahul.net/gyugyi/">Paul Gyugyi</a>.
It includes images of models, programs
for drawing LEGO&#174;, reviews of LEGO&#174; sets, and so forth.
The archive is currently located in Austria thanks to Brian Ward.
For a more Web-friendly (but possibly less complete) view of the
same collection, look at my
<!WA50><!WA50><!WA50><!WA50><a name="g2a" href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/karr/lego/archive/index.html">hypertext guide</a>
to the archive.

<dt><!WA51><!WA51><!WA51><!WA51><a name="jl-lego" 
href="http://xray3.chem.sunysb.edu/msl/lego/homepage.html"
>The Construction Toy Home Page</a>.
<dd>
Joseph Lauher has put together a substantial resource here, not
only about LEGO&#174; but about other toys as well.
This page has in-depth features on
Technic, Model Team, and LEGO&#174; trains, as well as images of
brochures and catalogs both from the Samsonite era in the US
(1963-1973) and more recent times, and the ``Model of the Month.''
This page also featured a
<!WA52><!WA52><!WA52><!WA52><a href="http://sbchm1.chem.sunysb.edu/msl/LEGO/entries.html"
>Summer Building Contest</a> in 1995.
This page has other unique features, such as an explanation of
``<!WA53><!WA53><!WA53><!WA53><a href="http://sbchm1.chem.sunysb.edu/msl/lego/molecular.html"
>molecular LEGO&#174; bricks</a>,'' 
molecules that self-assemble into a ``wall.''

<dt><!WA54><!WA54><!WA54><!WA54><a name="yahoo" href="http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Toys/LEGOS/"
>Yahoo's Recreation:Toys:LEGOS links</a>.
<dd>
Yahoo has collected many LEGO-related links under this heading,
though to a large extent these duplicate links you would find here or on
Michael Dorneich's
<!WA55><!WA55><!WA55><!WA55><a href="http://tortie.me.uiuc.edu/~dorneich/lego/Elego.html"
>Everything LEGO</a> page.

<dt><!WA56><!WA56><!WA56><!WA56><a name="rtm" href="http://utmdacc.mda.uth.tmc.edu:5014/eric/rtm/rtm.html"
>The Raving Toy Maniac Page</a>.
<dd>
This site, maintained by Eric G. Myers, offers all sorts of Internet and Web
resources for toy enthusiasts.
These include a very good collection of LEGO-related links on
<!WA57><!WA57><!WA57><!WA57><a href="http://utmdacc.mda.uth.tmc.edu:5014/eric/rtm/lego.html"
>The Internet Toy Off-White Pages LEGO&#174; Page</a>
(but again, see 
<!WA58><!WA58><!WA58><!WA58><a href="http://tortie.me.uiuc.edu/~dorneich/lego/Elego.html"
>Michael Dorneich's list</a>).

</dl>
</p>

<p>
A number of the pages that are currently in the
<!WA59><!WA59><!WA59><!WA59><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/karr/lego/webarama.html"
>list of LEGOmaniacs on the Web</a>
really should be in the above list due to the depth and breadth
of their content.  My apologies to everyone whose excellent efforts
I have failed to properly acknowledge here.
</p>


<h3><a name="b2">Academic Web Sites</a></h3>

<p>
There are so many Web sites at schools of all sorts
(from fourth grade up through graduate school)
that I've had to list them on a
<!WA60><!WA60><!WA60><!WA60><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/karr/lego/academia.html">separate page</a>.
Happy hunting!
</p>


<h3><a name="b3">Usenet News</a></h3>

<p>
The Usenet news group for LEGO&#174; topics is 
<!WA61><!WA61><!WA61><!WA61><a name="news" href="news:rec.toys.lego">rec.toys.lego</a>.
A hypertext version of the
<!WA62><!WA62><!WA62><!WA62><a href="http://www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~tom/legofaq.html">rec.toys.lego FAQ</a>
(Frequently Asked Questions list)
is maintained by Tom Pfeifer 
(<!WA63><!WA63><!WA63><!WA63><a href="mailto:pfeifer@fokus.gmd.de">e-mail: pfeifer@fokus.gmd.de</a>)
in Germany.
A <!WA64><!WA64><!WA64><!WA64><a href="ftp://earthsea.stanford.edu/pub/lego/faq/lego-faq"
>plain-text version</a> (not necessarily up-to-date)
is in the
<!WA65><!WA65><!WA65><!WA65><a href="ftp://earthsea.stanford.edu/pub/lego">LEGO&#174; FTP archive</a>
(also described <!WA66><!WA66><!WA66><!WA66><a href="#earthsea">above</a>).
</p>

<p>
In early 1995 a number of subscribers to rec.toys.lego participated
in a ``roll call'' by each posting his or her response to a survey.
Andy Watkins and I archived as many of these responses as we could,
and I continue to archive responses to the occasional revivals of
the survey.  These archives are combined in an on-line
summary, now available via a convenient
<!WA67><!WA67><!WA67><!WA67><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/karr/lego/roll-call/toc.html">table of contents</a>.
</p>

<p>
The NIC keeps a page of
<!WA68><!WA68><!WA68><!WA68><a name="rtlstats"
href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/usenet-i/groups-html/rec.toys.lego.html"
>statistics on the rec.toys.lego newsgroup</a>
which may be interesting to view; see their guesses about
how many of us read the newsgroup and how many hundreds if not
thousands of dollars each of our postings costs the Net.
</p>


<h3><a name="b4">Trading Opportunities</a></h3>

<p>
There are frequent sales and auctions of LEGO&#174; on the rec.toys.lego
newsgroup.  Some of these are for real ``collectors' items,'' but
many break up brand-new sets to 
redistribute the pieces in different assortments;
and in my opinion, this is a very
good thing in light of LEGO's current organization of their sets.
</p>

<p>
In 1995, Todd Lehman ran one of these auctions, nicknamed
AucZILLA, literally for months.  This auction was so big,
it even has its own 
<!WA69><!WA69><!WA69><!WA69><a href="http://www.winternet.com/~lehman/auczilla.html">home page</a>
on the Web, worth visiting (as long as it stays on line) if you want
to see what kind of prices to expect for various pieces in Internet
auctions.
Todd has written an excellent
<!WA70><!WA70><!WA70><!WA70><a href="http://www.winternet.com/~lehman/lego/rtlm-faq.html"
>rec.toys.lego Auction & Shipping FAQ</a>
with helpful information on buying and selling LEGO&#174; over the Internet.
</p>

<p>
<a name="jmanx">Jason Mantor</a>
(see his <!WA71><!WA71><!WA71><!WA71><a href="http://www.albany.net/~mantoj/index.html">home page</a>)
has put his enterprise,
<!WA72><!WA72><!WA72><!WA72><a href="http://www.rtl-bricks.com/">RTL Bricks</a>,
on the Web.
You can select a specific part from the RTL Bricks catalog in
a specific color and order it in bulk.
There is also a marketplace for individuals to post ads to buy or sell LEGO&#174;
of whatever kind they desire.
The site has some raytracings of original designs and promises
other services in the future.
</p>

<p>
<!WA73><!WA73><!WA73><!WA73><a href="http://www.es.co.nz/~lego/">Global Wholesale Toys</a>
has a page offering on-line purchase of LEGO&#174; sets
at about a 20% discount from ``normal'' prices.
Their prices still seem quite high compared to 
<!WA74><!WA74><!WA74><!WA74><a href="http://www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~tom/legofaq.html#asah"
>U.S. Shop-at-Home</a>, but
perhaps that merely indicates that ``normal'' prices in
New Zealand are much higher than in the United States.
</p>

<h3><a name="b5">Personal WWW Pages</a></h3>

<p>
Quite a large number of people have put their own LEGO&#174; lore on the
Web, or have volunteered to identify their regular home pages as those
of LEGOmaniacs.
I've tried to make as complete a list of these pages as I can.
There are some real gems on these pages, too many for me to list above, 
so I highly recommend you peruse the
<!WA75><!WA75><!WA75><!WA75><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/karr/lego/webarama.html"
>(nearly) complete list of LEGOmaniacs' Web pages</a>.
