<TITLE> The CS211 contest </TITLE>

<H1> The fabulous CS211 contest page </H1>

<P> Here in CS211 land, we have a problem. </P>

<P> Look at the other CS course home pages.  CS212 has got an
eval-apply logo, CS512 has some thing with a lambda on it, CS515 has
that funky scrolling text, and even CS432 has a lame (but still better
than nothing) picture of their textbook.  What do we have?  Nothing.
</P>

<P> We need help!  Here's your chance to make a difference.  Create,
borrow, or steal a picture for us.  Here are the rules: </P>

<P>
<LI> The picture must be in either GIF or JPEG format. </LI>
<LI> The picture must be fairly small -- see the course home page for
examples. </LI>
<LI> Send your submissions via e-mail to <!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><A
HREF="mailto:jfoster@cs.cornell.edu"> jfoster@cs.cornell.edu </A>.</LI>
<LI> You should either uuencode or binhqx your file (attaching a file in Eudora
will be sufficient). </LI>
<LI> Don't send in anything you wouldn't want your mother to see. </LI>
<LI> Winners will receive absolutely nothing, but will be
acknowledged on the home page. </LI>
</P>

<P> The entries so far (authors have been omitted, but I'm keeping track): </P>
