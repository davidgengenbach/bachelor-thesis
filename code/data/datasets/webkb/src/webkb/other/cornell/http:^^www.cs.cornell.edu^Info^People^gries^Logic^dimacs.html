              TEACHING LOGIC AND REASONING <br>
                  IN AN ILLOGICAL WORLD  <br><br>  
       
          Rutgers University   25-26 July 1996  <br><br>
  
<font size=+1>

  Sponsored by the DIMACS Special Year on Logic and Algorithms <br>
           and the Association for Symbolic Logic <br>
      in conjunction with the Federated Logic Conference.  <br>
     Hosted by Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey <br>

<p>Logic and logical thinking are central to all disciplines and are
critical in the mathematical and computer sciences.  This symposium
will explore the teaching of introductory logic and logical thinking,
with a primary focus on the college level and a secondary focus on
the high school level.  The symposium will be interdisciplinary,
emphasizing and contrasting approaches used in mathematics, computer
science, natural sciences, and engineering.</p>

<p>The symposium seeks a sharing of ideas, rather than consensus, on how
to teach logic, so that all participants gain an appreciation for the
fundamental issues and ultimately are better able to motivate the
importance of logic and to convey the foundations of logical reasoning
to students.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
