<br>Masters of<br>Engineering<br>Projects</h1> 
<br clear=left>

This place is a first attempt at collecting M-Eng projects. The goal is
to provide a show-case for sucessfully completed projects as well as
ideas for new projects. Contributions are welcome...
<p>

<h1>This page is from 1995! Some of the projects might still be available.</h1>

<hr>

A few reminders:
<ul>
<li>This is an incomplete list. If you have a specific topic in mind, feel
free to contact the appropriate faculty member directly.<p>
<li>Many of the projects can be adapted from 3 to 6 credits depending on
how much work you can put in.<p>
<li>You need to sign up 'til sept. 30th if you want to get project credits
this semester. <b>However</b>, there is generally no reason to. You can
do the project now and get credit in the spring...<p>
<li>If you find that most of the interesting projects require knowledge
you don't have, look into extending a course project into the M-Eng
project. That's the best way to get the background.<p>
</ul>

<H2>Project proposals</H2>

<h3>Claire Cardie</h3>

<ul>

<li>Build any of a number of statistical models of language
processing to be used for tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and
word sense tagging of natural language text.  We will evaluate the
models by testing their performance on a corpus of real-world text
and comparing the results to the performance of an existing language
learning system that relies instead on symbolic machine learning
techniques. Note: No knowledge of linguistics is required.<p>

<li>We have a language acquisition system that uses symbolic machine
learning techniques to perform a number of disambiguation tasks on
natural language texts at the word level (e.g., decide the
appropriate meaning or part of speech of a word in a given context).
This project would involve extending the system to handle any of a
number of higher level disambiguation tasks like (1) deciding what
phrase a prepositional phrase modifies (e.g., "I went to the store
IN JUNE" vs.  "I went to the store IN ITHACA"), or (2)
distinguishing metaphorical from literal uses of a phrase (e.g.,
deciding that "...KILLING two birds with one stone" does not imply a
real murder).  Note: No knowledge of linguistics is required.  <p>

<h4>Parallel Graph-Theoretic Algorithms for Sparse Matrix Factorizations</h4>

We are interested in the design and implementation
of scalable parallel algorithms for three fundamental
sparse matrix problems: sparse Cholesky factorization
sparse LU factorization and sparse QR factorization.
A typical sparse matrix factorization algorithm consists of 
a symbolic phase and a numeric phase. In the symbolic phase,
the adjacency graph of a sparse matrix is reordered and 
the symbolic structure of its matrix factors is determined.
In the numeric phase, the numerical values of the matrix 
factors are computed. While several efficient parallel 
algorithms for the numeric phase have recently been proposed,
efficient and practical parallel algorithms for the symbolic phase 
are yet to be developed. Among the projects in this area are:
<ul>
<li>Develop parallel algorithms for reordering a sparse matrix
and implement them on the IBM SP2.

<li>Develop parallel algorithms for structural prediction
in a sparse matrix factorization and implement them on the IBM SP2.
</ul>
If you are interested in these projects, please
contact Chunguang Sun, 729 Rhodes Hall(csun@cs.cornell.edu).

I have several projects connected with QMG including graphics,
interoperation with other software packages, and extensions to

<h3>Rich Zippel</h3>

There are two basic areas in which we are active, development of very high
level software development tools, especially in scientific computation, and
infrastructure to support collaboration among people separated by time and
space.

In the very high level software area we are developing a new programming
paradigm, where very high level specifications of computations are
converted to executable programs via a sequence of user controlled program
transformations.  Among the projects in this area are:

<ul>

<li>Develop and code new program transformations (e.g. for
parallelization, new numerical computation techniques, or transformation
that instantiate a particular concurrency control mechanism).

<li>By couple the existing transformations and external tools, perform
some large scale simulations, e.g. bone growth, explosion of a comet,
gravitation collapse of a pair of black holes.

<li>Develop and improve the user interface to the program transformation
process using either Apple Common Lisp, Unix Emacs or the Synthesizer
Generator.  Since this our programs include descriptions of three
dimensional objects this may include some novel interactions with graphics
programs.

<li>Linkage of program transformation technology with the theorem
proving and computational logic techology being developed by Prof.
Constable's group.

</ul>

For collaboration, we would like to integrate our tools and technologies
with the emerging standards on the Internet.  A few of these projects are
listed below, but there are a wide number of different possibilities.

<ul>

<li>The manuals for our tools have been written in Framemaker. For
highest quality printing, we would perfer to LaTeX.  Develop tools and
processes so that World Wide Web documents (HTML) can be mantained in
parallel with the Framemaker documents.  Develop automatic tools and
processes for going back and forth between Framemaker and Latex.

<li>A WWW manual should be organized and linked in a different fashion
than a printed manual.  Develop mechanisms and guidelines to aid in
maintaining printed and on-line manuals concurrently.

<li>Develop databases and links between Lotus Notes and WWW for running a
software development project.  How should bug tracking be handled,
releases, versions of manuals, user's comments, demonstrations, etc.?

</ul>
