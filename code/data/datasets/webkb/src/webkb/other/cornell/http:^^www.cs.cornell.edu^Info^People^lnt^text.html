<TITLE> Trefethen and Bau, NUMERICAL LINEAR ALGEBRA </TITLE>

<H2>NUMERICAL LINEAR ALGEBRA</H2>
<H3>Lloyd N. Trefethen and David Bau, III<br>
xii+355 pages<br>
SIAM, 1997</H3>
<p>

David Bau (currently at Microsoft) and I have recently completed
a graduate textbook on numerical linear algebra.
Our aims in this book are beauty, depth of insight, and brevity.
The text is split into
forty lectures, each about eight pages long.  It is based on
the course I have taught repeatedly at MIT and Cornell during
the past ten years.

<p>

The book is presently undergoing copy editing by
<a href="http://www.siam.org/">SIAM</a>, and it
will be published in 1997.
