<P><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><A href="http://www.madefast.org/"> MADEFAST </a>
is an <!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><A HREF="http://www.arpa.mil/">
ARPA</A>-sponsored project, administered with the assistance of
<!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><A HREF="http://www.nist.gov/">NIST</A>, to
demonstrate technology developed under the <!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><A
HREF="http://elib.cme.nist.gov/made/made.html">MADE</A> program. The
goal is to show how the computational tools developed under MADE can
be collaboratively used by MADE contractors at different sites to
design and manufacture a significant artifact.

<P> The proposed artifact is a seeker.  The term "seeker" generically
refers to a variety of (typically air-to-air) missle that employs
sensors to lock onto and track a target, guiding the missle.
Designing and building such a missle seeker is beyond the scope of the
MADEFAST project.  Instead, we are building a somewhat simpler device
with a non-lethal mission: to track a light displayed on a wall.

<P> The <!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><A
HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/SimLab/"> SimLab </A>
component of MADEFAST is to use the simulation and analysis tools
developed under MADE to aid in the design by providing analysis of the
physical behavior of the proposed artifact.
