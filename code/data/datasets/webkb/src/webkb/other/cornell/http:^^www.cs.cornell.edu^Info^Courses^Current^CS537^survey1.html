<title>CS 537 - Possible Survey Topics</title>
</head>

<body background="pics/fiber.gif">
<h2> Survey Topics for CS537 Papers</h2>
You are required to survey recent research papers on a
particular topic and present a survey of current
thinking on the topic. This will take the form of
a "survey paper" which you will submit. This will be
a Postscript document (preferably from LaTeX) which
has the format of a proper paper. In other words,
it has an introduction, various sections, a bibliography, etc.
You will need to present the material clearly (which
requires first a good understanding of the subject material).
It is not simply a matter of saying "Paper A says blah.
Paper B says blah." You will need to tie the two together,
so that reading your survey gives a reader an informed
insight into the topic. While this may appear tough
when you are doing it, you will find that it helps you
a lot down the road.
<p>
There are many topics listed below. There are also some
topics that stem from the project list. You will need to
choose a topic and talk with me about it. I will try to give
you an initial paper to get started, and after that, you need
to track down references from the library and collect more
papers. I expect each survey to look at about 5 papers.
Also, it is fine if more than one person works on the same
survey topic, and if the people on a topic discuss between
themselves. However, each person must write an individual
survey paper.
