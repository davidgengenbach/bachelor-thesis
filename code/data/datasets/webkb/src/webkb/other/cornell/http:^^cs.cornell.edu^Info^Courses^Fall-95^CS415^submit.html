<Title> How to submit Phase 3 </Title>
<H3> How to submit your support level </h3>
<p>

The deadline for phase 3 of the project is Friday December 8, at
midnight.
<p>
Once you are satisfied with your project (or too tired to continue)
please set the directories where your files are located to be 
world readable, and send to lorenzo@cs.cornell.edu a message where you
specify the name of those directories.
<p>
You will also have to submit a printout of the files that constitute
your nucleus to me (Lorenzo) by 4:30 pm on the next Monday, December
11. When you do so, you may want to spend a few minutes with me so we
can go over your code together. If you want, you can send me mail over
the weekend to set up appointments.
