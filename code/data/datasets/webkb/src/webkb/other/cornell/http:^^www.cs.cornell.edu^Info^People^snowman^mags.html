dan tells you that he reads too much.  (which you already noticed.)
some of the magazines that he reads are:

<ul>
<li>science news, which is a weekly 16-page newsmagazine of science.
not enough math and computer science, and <i>way</i> too much soft
science.  but it's kind of fun.

<li>utne reader, a bimonthly news and culture magazine.  its web
magazine, <a href = "http://www.utne.com">utne lens</a> is superb.

<li>lingua franca, which is a fine highbrow magazine for intellectuals
and academics.

<li>details magazine, which is not.  instead, details is the magazine
that has a questionable relationship with its closet.  it had an
affair with a man a few months back, and told one of its female
friends.  she was kind of surprised and told it not to make any major
lifestyle changes, but it went to a gay bar.  it didn't feel
comfortable, but it really liked the music and got a couple phone
numbers.  it's also worried that it doesn't look nearly trendy enough.

<li><a href = "http://web.mit.edu/techreview/www/tr.html">technology
review</a> is my alumni magazine from mit.  it's also quite well done,
in my view.

<li><a href = "http://www.theonion.com">the onion</a> has become by far my
favorite source for news-related humor on the web lately.  it's fantastic.

<li>the ithaca times, which is not on the web.

<li><a href = "http://www.syracuse.com">the syracuse
post-standard</a>, which is one of the best papers you can get here.
scary, huh?

<li>any number of occasional readings, from music to art to
pornography to science to literature to theater to culture.
