A dynamic brittle-ductile transition

A simulation of the dynamical failure of 3D notched solids under
 tension at the atomistic level using classical molecular dynamics and
system sizes from 10 to more than 100 million atoms.

Diagnosis of Emphysema and Lung Cancer using 3D techniques. </a>  <br>
</b> 
Modern radiologic techniques, particularly computed tomography (CT) and 
magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, acquire more data than are routinely displayed
in diagnostic images. Supercomputers can be
very helpful in processing and presenting this information.
 Image analysis used on
appropriate images in conjunction with representative 
patient databases will permit the
development of clinical analysis and decision support 
systems and will form an integral part of the
diagnostic process in the future.

Molecular Visualization</a>  <br>

A variety of research projects focusing on molecular visualization. Projects
range from imaging of chromosomes in petunias, to the mechanism of 
Acetylcholinesterase, to mechanisms of Chagas Disease. (Visualization by
Richard Gillilan).

Recently it was proved that there exist nonisomeric planar regions that have 
identical Laplace spectra. That is, one cannot "hear the shape of a drum." For

Cornell/Honeywell Keyboard Systems Study </a> <br></b>
 Two-dimension angular
deviation data of wrist motion, obtained with an exoskeleton measuring glove worn by human
subjects using keyboards, had previously been obtained by Hedge. While human factors
researchers had long used such measuring devices to obtain wrist motion data, this data had not
previously been visualized.

Tsunami simulations </a> <br></b>
Tusnami are caused by underwater earthquakes which start waves propagating
rapidly across the ocean. Simulations help to understand and predict these
large, often dangerous, phenomena.

Changes:
	Moved Hilo so all the animations are together at the end.
	Added the word "animation" so users would be aware that they're
		not just linking to another html page.

Moved link to video order to this page. BRL 12/19/95
