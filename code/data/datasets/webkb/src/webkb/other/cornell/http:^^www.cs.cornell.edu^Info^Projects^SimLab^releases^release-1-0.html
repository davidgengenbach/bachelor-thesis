<h1> SimLab Software Release </h1>

<p> <h2>Includes Algebra, Topology, and 2D Mesh Generator </h2>

<P> This is the initial release of the SimLab software. This release
includes mathematical functionality for algebraic and topological
computations (Weyl), as well as code (using Weyl) for creating
guaranteed-quality triangulations of planar areas.

<p> <h2> How to get the SimLab software </h2> 

<P> Implemented using
the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) in Common Lisp, the release is
available by ftp as a compressed (gzip) tar file (633820 bytes)
together with a plain text file "README-1-0" (4732 bytes) that
describes how to install the software.  These are files are available
via FTP at the site <b> ftp.cs.cornell.edu</b> in the directory <b>

<h2> An illustration of the mesh generation application </h2>

The purpose of a <b> mesh generation </b> algorithm is to take as
input the boundary <i> B </i> of a region of space <i> R </i>, and
create as output a triangulation of <i> R. </i>  This process is
required for a variety of numerical modeling methods, such as the <b>
finite element method (FEM).</b>  The <b> quality </b> of a given
triangulation can be measured in a variety of ways, and is important
for maintaining the numeric stability of the algorithm (such as FEM)
that use the mesh.  The SimLab code for mesh generation (described <!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><A

triangles of the mesh.

<p> The process of creating a guaranteed quality mesh is illustrated in
the following figures.  The first figure illustrates the input.  The
boundary of the region is drawn in black, while the region for which
a mesh is required is the area shown in green.
