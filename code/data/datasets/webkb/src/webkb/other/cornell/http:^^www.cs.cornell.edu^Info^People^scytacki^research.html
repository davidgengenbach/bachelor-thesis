<h1>Stuff</h1>
Currently I am working on an implementation of a image database.
The implementation that we are trying to do is one written in First in Rivl
and latter in Visual C or Visual Basic.  
The idea of this database is to use as many images as we can handle from
the web, and run a program on each one which generates an electronic 
discription of the image.  Then a second program will take this database and 
a sample image and generate a list of the top n images with similar
descriptions.<br>  
There are several similar databases out there
right now.  Links to those will come latter.  Most of these databases use 
color histograms to describe their images.  A color histogram is a list
of colors and the amount of each color in the image.
Color histograms are good for certain things, but a little example with 
demonstrate where they fail.<br>
Suppose you have a picture of a sunset.  (picture is coming). If this was
compaired to a randomly generated image that resemble the snow you sometimes
see on TV(but in color), the result could be a perfect match.  It is obvious
that it is not a perfect match, but each images has exactly the same amount
of each color in it.<br>
The goal then of this database is examine other methods of compairing images
that better represent a humans perception of similarity.<br>
Currently we have a comparision which incorporates positional data as well as
the color data.  Hopefully I have a better description of this later.  As long
as it can be released.
