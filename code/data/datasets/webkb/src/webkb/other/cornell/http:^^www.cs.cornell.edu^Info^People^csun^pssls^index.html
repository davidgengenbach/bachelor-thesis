<title> PSSLS: Parallel Solution of Sparse Least Squares Problems</title>

<P>
PSSLS(Parallel Solution of Sparse Least Squares Problems)
is a sparse matrix package
for solving large, sparse,
linear least squares problems
on distributed-memory machines.
This package is implemented in ANSI C 
using double-precision arithmetic.
The IBM Message-Passing Library(MPL)
is used for communication among processors.

<P>
PSSLS is a parallel direct sparse solver.
To solve a sparse linear least squares problem,
a sparse QR decomposition is computed. 
Then a sparse triangular system is solved.
Both the sparse QR factorization
and the triangular solution are carried out 
by a blocked-oriented parallel multifrontal scheme.
