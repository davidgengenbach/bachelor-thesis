This page is intended to be answer general questions for Tcl/Tk
developers ...


<pre>

Q: On Solaris 2.x, linking Tk 4.0 gives me the error:

      Undefined                       first referenced
       symbol                             in file
      socket                              /usr/local/X11R6/lib/libX11.so
      getpeername                         /usr/local/X11R6/lib/libX11.so
      xdrmem_create                       /usr/local/X11R6/lib/libX11.so
      gethostbyname                       /usr/local/X11R6/lib/libX11.so
      ...

A: You need to add "-lsocked -lnsl" to the "LIBS = " line in the Makefile.

System Lab Specific:

Q: How do I access the files in my Unix account from my Windows 95 and NT
   desktop?

A: Open Explorer. Go to the menu "Tools, Map Network Drive" and enter
   "\\Dawn\<your unix account name>" in the "Path" entry box. For
   example, I would use in "\\Dawn\ioi". Then, you will be able to
   access your files from the mapped drive.

   Note that (as of 09/10/96) the server Dawn is not visible in the
   "Network Neighborhood" list, but steps above work anyway.

Q: How do I use Windows applications in Unix?

A: You can use the "windd" command (/usr/local/bin/windd) to log on an
   NT machine. Type "windd" in an xterm and the windd desktop will
   come up.  Type the name of an NT server (such as vulture) in the
   "Application Server" entry box and press return. That will bring
   you to the NT login screen.

   Notice that WinDD runs Windows NT 3.51 only but most applications
   should work without problems. You'll miss the NT 4.0 desktop,
   though :-)

   Also, WinDD doesn't work on a black-and-white display.

   If you want to increase the size of the WinDD dekstop, try giving
   the -geometry option when you start windd. E.g. "windd -geometry
   1024x768".

Q: Where is purify for the different CUCS systems?

A: On Solaris: /opts/pure/bin/purify
   On SunOS:   /vol/pure/bin/purify


----------------------------------------------------------------------
The answers to the following topics will come up shortly.

Q: How do I maintain binaries of different platforms in the same file system?
   E.g., I want to compile Tcl/Tk for both SunOS and Solaris, but now I need
   to do a "make distclean; ./configure" each time I want to compile binaries
   for a different platform.

A: Use symbolic links. cd ~ioi/wdev and look at the directory
   structure. I use it to manage four configurations
   (SunOS+Solaris)*Purify with a single source base.

   More explanations will come up shortly.

Q: What is purify? Why can it help me with my Tcl/Tk development?



Q: There is no purify on Linux. What alternatives can I use?

Q: What is the -DMEM_DEBUG flag when I compile Tcl?

Q: What is the Tcl/Tk Engineering Manual?

Q: What is CVS?

Q: How do I develop a test suite for my Tcl/Tk applications?

Q: A quick example for writing Tcl/Tk test suites?

Q: How do I compile my Tcl/Tk extension into a shared library?

A: I am working on an example ...
