<li>Anything by Joel & Ethan Coen
<li>The Fabulous Baker Boys
<li>Annie Hall
<li>Real Genius
<li>29th Street
<li>Fearless
<li>Monty Python's Life of Brian
</ul>

Want to see a movie in Ithaca? Here are the
<a href="gopher://gopher1.cit.cornell.edu/11/.dirs/MOVIES">
movie listings and schedules</a> for the five local theatres.

Warning: Listings often hopelessly out of date.<p>
