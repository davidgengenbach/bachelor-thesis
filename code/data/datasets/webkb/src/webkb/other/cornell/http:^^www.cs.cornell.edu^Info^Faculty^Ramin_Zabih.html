<p>
My research interests are in computer vision.  I am interested in
developing real-time vision systems, and in using these systems for tasks
such as robot control and the automatic annotation of image sequences. I am
concerned with the design of efficient algorithms for extracting useful
information from image sequences whose content is not known in advance.  My
focus has been on motion and stereo, but I am also interested in other
low-level properties of images, such as texture, color and edges.
<p>
My current work focuses on determining the number of moving objects in a
scene, and using this information for the automatic annotation of video
sequences. Before that, I worked on motion-based tracking of unmodeled
objects.
