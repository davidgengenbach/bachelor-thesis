<P>
Signs to Cornell direct you up Buffalo St.  There's a lot of construction
in that area, so you may have to follow the road straight to Route 13,
then make a left on 13 north and a right on Buffalo.
Once you're on Buffalo, follow it to the top of the hill (Eddy St)
Turn left on Eddy St and follow it around to the right, up
the hill.
Turn left at the first light (College Ave), and cross the
bridge on Central Ave.
You're now on Campus.
<P>

<P>
Follow Central to the end.
Make a right and ask for a visitor's pass at the parking booth on
your immediate right.  They'll give you a map, and tell you where
you can park.  The best lot is the Phillip's Hall lot, but that may
be full.  To get to the Phillip's Hall lot, continue straight and
turn right at the second stop sign.
The lot is the first driveway on your right.
The yellow building there is Upson Hall.  Take the elevator
to the 4<SUP>th</SUP> floor.  I'm in 4119A (to the left as you
exit the elevator).
