We refine our parallel supercomputer design ideas
with an execution-driven simulation system
called the <!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/wwt/sigmetrics93_wwt.ps">
<em>Wisconsin Wind Tunnel.</em></A>  It runs a parallel shared-memory
program on a parallel computer (Thinking Machines CM-5) and uses
execution-driven, distributed, discrete-event simulation to accurately
calculate program execution time.  
<p>
The project is gets its name from tools--such as the Wisconsin Wind
Tunnel--that allow us to cull the design space of parallel
supercomputers in a manner similar to how aeronautical engineers use
conventional wind tunnels to design airplanes.
