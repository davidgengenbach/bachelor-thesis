beautiful city on the Italian riviera where ISCA-22 was held.

on the left and Nicholas (4 years) is on the right.  Katie loves to climb and
tease Nicholas.  Nicholas is into all sports.  They are both budding hackers!

to bug Nicholas...  Fortunately for Katie, her *big* brother is a very good
sport.
