<h2>Speakers:</h2>Juan Alvarez<BR>

<h2>Title:</h2>Ultrasonic range data: Practical shortcomings<BR>  

<h2>Time and Place:</h2>Thursday, Oct.31, 2:30-3:30 PM, Conf. Room (ME #336)<BR>

<h2>Abstract:</h2>
Sonar provides direct range information at low cost.  That's why they
are widely used in different mobile robot topics (map building,
navigation and obstacle avoidance).  But they offer many shortcomings,
in many cases difficult to manage. We will show experimental results
to illustrate these problems.
