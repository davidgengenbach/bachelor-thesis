<html>
<title> Put your title here.  </title>

<body>
<p align=center>  <!-- To make a section centered start like this. -->

<h1>Here is a large Heading</h1>

<hr  >       <!-- That's a horizontal line, and this is a comment. -->

</p>                           <!-- The end of the centered section. >

This is some everyday text.               <!-- some regular text. -->
Notice how it looks different when you 
select View|Source from the Menu.
I'm adding quite a bit    of    extra text to make a point.
So, go look. really.



<br>  <!-- a line break, for when you want the text to stop -->

More regular text, this time with a few fancy extras added. Lokk at these here, 

<em> Italics!! </em> 

<strong> Bold! </strong>

Showing how to do those is fun. Line break! <br>

<h2> smaller heading </h2>
<h3> even smaller heading </h3>
<h6> really tiny heading </h6>

Notice what each heading does.


Next, we have a picture (Could it be... Nate?)

   ALT="The Big Monkey">

  <!-- The ALT part is what shows when Images are turned off. -->

I don't think so.  Look what happens to text with pictures.

<p>   <!-- starts a new paragraph. -->

How about a list of things?

<h3> The List of Things </h3>
<ul>  <!-- The list starts like this -->

 <li> This Thing          <!-- an Item in the List -->
 <li> That Thing
 <li> The Other Thing

</ul> <!-- The List Ends  -->


And finally, a link to another page. <br>
