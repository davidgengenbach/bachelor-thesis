<P>Hi there, this is a Rachel, brother, friends page. All thats really here
are a few pictures that I think are neat.  This second one is a picture
of Rachel with a dragonfly on her nose. We went camping this summer and
we met a dragonfly named Mortland. My brother wrote a song about it <!WA0><IMG SRC=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~jherro/pics/danguit.gif> and
its neat.<!WA1><IMG SRC="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~jherro/pics/rachfly.gif"> Thats my brother. Oh, his name is dan.
<!WA2><IMG SRC=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~jherro/pics/deoder.gif> Oh! and on the left of him is Jess and on the right is Meg. </P>
<P> This is a picture of Rachel climbing a rock.

<P>And finally this is a picture of Rachel and me, just to prove that i
was actually there with her. This is actually from a different camping
trip than the first picture, but it is the same trip as the second one.<!WA4><IMG SRC="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~jherro/pics/srrock.gif"
><BR>
Rachel wanted me to put this picture in here. She doesn't really ever 
wear bikini's, but if she did then this is how she would look. And I
decided to put another one here too, just for fun!
