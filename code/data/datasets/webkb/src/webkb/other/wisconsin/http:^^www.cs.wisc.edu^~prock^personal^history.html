<H1 align=center>Personal History</h1>
<hr>

<p>I grew up in the <!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><a
href="http://www.intellicast.com/weather/msp/wxmsp.html">cold</a> city of
<!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><a href="http://designstein.com/gmcva/hi_res.html">Minneapolis</a>. A very
nice place to live but to be honest, I don't really recomend visiting
there. I went to <!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><a
href="http://informns.k12.mn.us/~0001do/south/south.html">Minneapolis South
High School</a> and spent much of my time there on the math, and swim
teams. If you are really really really curious about Minneapolis check out
<!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><a href="http://www.mtn.org/mtn/sites.html">this site</a>.

<p>I went to southern California for my undergraduate. I received my BA in
Mathematics from <!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><a href="http://www.acusd.edu">USD</a> in San Diego. It is a
small, Catholic, liberal arts university that specializes in Business. It also
has one of the pretiest campuses in Southern California.

<p>After my four year adventure in San Diego I returned to Mineapolis. I
basically relaxed for a while and met a lot of interesting people. In
particular I met Rachel, my girlfriend and an interesting computer
artist named <!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><a
href="http://www.winternet.com:80/users/forrest/self1.jpg">Forrest</A>. He
is the one responsible for the <!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><a 
href="http://www.spacestar.com:80/users/forrest/backgrounds.html">backgrounds</a> 
on my homepage. 
Check out his <!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><a href="http://www.spacestar.com:80/users/forrest/">art
gallery</A>. I also spent a couple of months employed at <!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><a
href="http://www.network.com">NSC</a>, a Minneapolis based router 
company like Cisco.

<p>I am currently a Computer Sciences grad student at the <!WA9><!WA9><!WA9><!WA9><!WA9><!WA9><a
href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu"> UW Madison</a>. It is a lot colder here than
in San Diego, but just a bit warmer than Minneapolis. Of course as a
graduate student the department expects me to take <!WA10><!WA10><!WA10><!WA10><!WA10><!WA10><a
href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~prock/personal/classes.html">classes</A>.

<p>To make ends meet (which they barely do) I work as a TA for <!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><a
href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs302/cs302.html">CS 302</A>. I am also a 
math tutor. If interested <!WA12><!WA12><!WA12><!WA12><!WA12><!WA12><a href="mailto:prock@cs.wisc.edu">mail me</a>.
