      must be turned in on the Sol machines but they can be
      written/debugged on a PC or Mac. The PC version of the
      simulator can be downloaded from ftp://

   <P><B>Course Description</B></P>
   
   <DL>
      <DD>The intent of the course is to give students an
      understanding of the kinds of operations that can be executed
      efficiently in hardware and how the operations are performed.
      Representation of numbers, characters, data structures and
      instructions will be discussed. Several assembly language
      programs will be written in order to gain a better
      understanding of the general concepts of machine organization,
      not to learn assembly language programming for production use.
      Computer architecture will be viewed as the interface between
      the hardware and the set of basic instructions executed by the
      hardware.

   <P><B>Grades</B></P>
   
   <DL>
      <DD>The grades in the course will be based on: 6, 20 point
      homework assignments (20%), 6, 25 point half hour quizzes
      (25%), 6, 35 point programs (35%) and a 120 point comprehensive
      final exam (20%).

      date. There is a 25% penalty per (24 hour) day for late

   <DL>
      <DD>Quizzes and the final exam will be open book/notes but no
      calculators. Quizzes will take 1/2 hour and will be given in
      class, at the end of the class period. There will be no
      rescheduled quizzes. You must take your quiz in the section in
      which you are offically enrolled. Your best 6 out of 7 quizzes
      count. The final is scheduled for 12:25 - 2:25 Thursday,
      12/19/96. Bring your student ID. There will be no rescheduled
      finals without at least two weeks prior notice, and then only
      for a very good reason. Rescheduled finals must be taken early.
