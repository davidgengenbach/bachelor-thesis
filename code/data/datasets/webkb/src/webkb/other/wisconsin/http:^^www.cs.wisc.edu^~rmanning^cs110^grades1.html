<TITLE>Grades for Lecture 13</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>

<P>Well, here they are, the grades for lecture 13.  I was very happy with
the effort everyone put in on the programs, and I hope you're enjoying
the extra time you have now!  Grades are listed by the last 4 digits
of your student ID number as given on my class list, although there
wasn't much need to separate them.  Program 4 and other unreturned
homeworks are in a box on my desk in my office. 

<P>If you want, click <a href="mailto:rmanning@cs.wisc.edu">here</a>
to give me some feedback!  I'd especially like
to know whether program 4 was too hard, or whether it was worth the
extra time to do. 

<P>
