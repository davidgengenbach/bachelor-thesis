As you learn how to program in C++, you will run into difficulties.  I believe
that through a combination of reading the text and attending the lectures, you
will learn enough to minimize these difficulties.  By attending class regularly,
you will save time in the long run in that you will hear explanations
and engage in discussion, things that do not happen in a self-study (which is
essentially what you have by not attending class).  Two other less attractive
reasons are:    <br>
<UL>
  <LI> There will be six quizzes given, in class, that will count as 10% of
       your grade (your worst will be dropped).
  <LI> Test questions will be made primarily with the lectures in mind.  This
       is not to say, of course, that questions from the readings will not
       appear on tests.  
</UL>
In a nutshell, you are responsible for what is covered in class. 
I understand
that things come up and occasionally one must miss class, but please check
with me or a classmate if this occurs to you.  <P>
