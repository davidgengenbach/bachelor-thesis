<P>
Assignments must be received by the TAs or the instructor by 5:00 PM on the
day when they are due.  Assignments received later will lose 5 % 
of the grade
for each of the first three days.  After three days, the solution will
be made public, and assignments turned in subsequently receive no credit.
In order to avoid lateness caused by machine loads, coincident due
dates for CS classes, etc., simply be sure to get started right away on
each assignment.
Things are certain to go wrong now and then, so don't wait until the
last minute to start.
<P>
Please note that in a project team, each member has three distinct
responsibilities:
<ul>
   <LI>To decide upon a schedule of tasks for each assignment, together
with the other partner.
   <LI>To complete the tasks that he or she agreed to complete.
   <LI>To *frequently* check on how his or her partner is progressing
on their tasks.
</ul>

So you should not just ask your partner about where they are the day
before the assignment is due!
