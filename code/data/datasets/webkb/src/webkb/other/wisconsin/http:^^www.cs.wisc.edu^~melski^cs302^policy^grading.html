<H3>Grading Percentages</H3>

<P>The following percentages have been assigned for CS302:

<PRE>
       <B>Exams</B>                             60%
         - Midterm I  (week 7)         20%
         - Midterm II (week 12)        20%
         - Final      (week 16)        20%
       <B>Quizzes</B>                            5%
       <B>Programs</B>                          35%
       --------------------------------------
       <B>Total</B>                            100%
</PRE>

<P>Individual assignments and exams will <B>not</B> be assigned letter
grades.  Letter grades will be assigned at the end of the semester
such that 2.8 is the class's overall grade point average.  Exceptions
may be made for truely exceptional classes.

<H3>Program Grading Standards</H3>

<p> Grading of programming assignments is based upon three criteria:
correctness, technique, and readability.

<p> <strong> Correctness </strong> is by far the most important criterion. 
A program which does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the
assignment is subject to a grade reduction of as much as 50% or more.

<p> The <strong> technique </strong> used in a program is the means
in which that particular problem was solved.  A solution which is
correct but clumsy or awkward is subject to a grade reduction of as much
as 25%.  Sometimes there will be very little leeway in this area; other
times there might be several correct solutions.

<p> The <strong> readability </strong> of a program refers to the ease
with which a <em>human</em> reader (such as the grader!) can read and
understand the source code.  The readability does not affect the
execution of the program; however, poor readability can result in
programming errors which make the program incorrect.  Poor readability
can also result in a grade reduction of as much as 25%.  The readability
of a program includes:

<ul>
  <li> Proper and consistent indentation of statements
  <li> Documentation (via comments) for functions and parameters,
       and for non-obvious variables and pieces of code
  <li> Use of blank lines to separate logically separate pieces of code
  <li> Use of meaningful identifiers for variables, functions, etc.
  <li> Correct use of constants
  <li> Use of <em>idioms</em> (customary standard ways of writing
       logically equivalent pieces of code) discussed in class
</ul>
