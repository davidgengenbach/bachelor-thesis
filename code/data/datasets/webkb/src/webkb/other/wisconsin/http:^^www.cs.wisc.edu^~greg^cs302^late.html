<H2>Late Policy</H2>

<P>Programming assignments consist of printed copies of both <B>source
code</B> and the <B>output</B> generated by the program, and by copying
your <b>source code</b> and <b>executable</b>
to a special "hand-in" directory.  Specific instructions are
provided in the assignment pages.  It is your responsiblility to plan
ahead and get your work done early.  The following late policy is provided
in case of emergencies, and is not to be used carelessly.

<P>Programming assignments may be handed in any time during the day it is due,
either during the class period or at my office.
If I am not at my office, please slip your assignment under my door.
If you have not handed in your homework by the time I walk 
into my office the following morning, it is late.

<h3>One Period Policy</h3>
You can always turn in your assignment up to one class period
late and receive some (but perhaps not all) of the 
credit for that assignment. No homework will be accepted 
more than one class period late. The exact rules are as follows:

<UL>
<LI>  You can turn in three assignments up to one class period late,
and you will not be penalized for lateness on these three assignments.

<LI>  If you turn in a fourth, fifth, etc. assignment after 
the deadline but at most one class period late, then you will 
receive 70% of the credit you would have received if you 
had turned it in on time.

<LI>  <I>Worst-case</I>:  If you have just about used up your
one period and your program still does not complete, turn
in what you have with a short paragraph explaining what you 
still need to do.  Don't list excuses, just explain your plan.
You will receive some charity points depending on how close you
were to completion and how correct your program appears (maximum
50%).

</UL>
Remember, it is better to turn in an assignment before 
the deadline, but if you miss the deadline, you will 
still always get some credit if you turn in the 
assignment within one class period of the deadline. No 
assignments will be accepted more than one class period late.<P>

In case of severe medical emergencies or such, see 
me as soon as possible to discuss the situation.<P>
