<h1> Room Reservations</h1>
<p>
This applet is a viewer for the Rooms database.
The user can request to view all the reservations for a particular date 
or for a particular day of the week.  
The applet then connects to the Rooms database and displays the results
in sorted order (by room number, starting time, or ending time depending
on the user's choice).
<p>
Instructions:
<p>
To change the field on which the output is sorted, click on the box 
under the words "Sort by:" and select the desired field.  
Note: changing the sort choice must be done before selecting the day or
date.
<p>
To see all the standing reservations for a particular day of the week,
double-click on that day in the box on the left.
<p>
To see all the reservations for a particular day, replace the string 
"Put a date here" with the date (e.g. 10/23/96) and then click the 
"Show Reservations" button.
