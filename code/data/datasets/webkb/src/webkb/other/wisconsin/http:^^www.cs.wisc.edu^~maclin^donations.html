<H1> SACM Holiday Donation Drive </H1>

<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
During this holiday season, several graduate students have volunteered to
help organize donations to targeted area charities on behalf of the CS
Department.  There is a big need in our community for food, toys, and
clothing for needy persons.  We think that many people in the department
would like to give -- we will help by providing a list of needs and
collecting and delivering donations.  It would be great if our department
can make a difference in the lives of some less fortunate Madison
residents!  We encourage all faculty, staff, graduates and undergraduates
to participate.

We plan to target four charities as our beneficiaries.  The Dane County
Advocates for Battered Women serves to house battered women and their
children, the Middleton Outreach Ministry feeds needy families, the Off the
Square Club benefits mentally ill adults, and the Respite Center provides
crisis child care.  See the list below for specific needs of each
organization.  In addition, we've listed the American Red Cross who is
always in need of blood donations.  If you want your donation to go to a
specific organization, please label it, otherwise we will distribute them
as we see fit.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Please leave donations in the holiday box in the 6th floor lounge (room
6331) by December 21st.  (Donations will be moved at least once daily to a
locked storage room.)  If you prefer to give a cash donation, just drop a
check made out to 'SACM' in the SACM mailbox and mark it 'Holiday Fund.'
We have set up this WWW page to list needs and report on our progress.
If you have questions, ask any of the committee members.

<H2>Middleton Outreach Ministry.</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
7325 Hubbard Ave., 836-7388.
The ministry expects to give away 30 tons of groceries this year through its
food pantry, which serves more than a hundred families a month.
Any nonperishable item is appreciated and they often have shortages of canned
juices and stew-type foods.
Gift certificates to local merchants would be great too; with them, needy
parents could choose gifts for their children.

<H2>The Respite Center.</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
2120 Fordem Ave., 244-5700.
This agency provides 24-hour crisis child care for children under 14, often
after an incident of domestic violence.
Night lights and lullaby tapes would help kids feel less afraid.
New socks, underwear, and toddler-sized sweat pants are also big needs.
"Often kids arrive with just the clothes on their back," says Sharon Kilfoy.
The center could also use items to keep children occupied during their stay.
Toothbrushes, combs and barrettes would be appreciated too -- the kids love to
have someone sit and do their hair.
And to help children express their feelings about what has happended at
home art supplies would be appreciated.
Items can be new or used if they are clean and in good condition (no used
stuffed animals, please).
If you are feeling generous with your time, they also need someone to set up a
database for them (call 244-5700 and ask for Meg).

<H2>American Red Cross.</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
4860 Sheboygan Ave., 233-9000 (ext. 257, volunteers; ext. 301, blood donors).
Here's a gift you don't even have to shop for.
Stop by the Dane County Forum on Dec. 24 to donate blood.
The Red Cross also needs volunteers to register donors, take vital signs and
hand out cookies and juice.
(Note that you can also donate right next door during
the week at Young Blood in the Union South.)
