<H1>Caffeine Ratings</H1>

<PRE>
According to the National Soft Drink Association, the following is the
caffeine content in mgs per 12 oz can of soda:

Jolt                    100.0
Sugar-Free Mr. Pibb     58.8
Mountain Dew            54.0
Mello Yellow            52.8
Tab                     46.8
Coca-Cola               45.6
Diet Cola               45.6
Shasta Cola             44.4
Shasta Cherry Cola      44.4
Shasta Diet Cola        44.4
Mr. Pibb                40.8
Dr. Pepper              39.6
Pepsi Cola              38.4
Aspen                   36.0
Diet Pepsi              36.0
RC Cola                 36.0
Diet RC                 36.0
Diet Rite               36.0
Canada Dry Cola         30.0
Canada Dry Diet Cola    1.2
7 Up                    0

By means of comparison, a 7 oz cup of coffee has the following caffeine (mg)
amounts, according to Bunker and McWilliams in _J Am Diet_ 74:28-32, 1979:

Drip                    115-175
Brewed                  80-135
Instant                 65-100
Decaf                   3-4

In chem 120 we extracted at least 5 grams of caffeine from Tea.  We used a
regular tea bag - my guess is orange peckoe.   Quote from the lab manual:
Caffeine is present in tea leaves and in coffee to the extent of about 4%.
Tea also contains two other alkaloids, theobromine and theophilline.
These last two relax the smooth muscles where caffeine stimulates the
heart and respiratory systems.

Other data on caffeine:

Cup of coffee    90-150mg
Instant coffee   60-80mg
Canada Dry Diet Cola    1.2
7 Up                    0
