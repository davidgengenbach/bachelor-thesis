Directions to My Office

</a>

To get to CS&S 3310, walk into the building's front door on Dayton
St. and keep walking straight until you see the large Computer Sciences
Department photo board.  Go through the door to the right of the photo
board and take the stairs up one-and-a-half floors.  You will see a
door with a piece of paper taped to it that says 3310.  Go through
that door and follow the hallway around the corner until you
 see a large fishbowl-like office.  My desk is in this office; it's
the one with the <!WA0><IMG SRC="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ben/images/I_HEART_AL.gif" > 
bumper sticker on the monitor.
