Some of these comments are unique to our particular site, especially
considering our networking set-up. 

<P>

File names in DOS must follow the 8 dot 3 convention.  This means that
a filename in DOS (and by extention Windows) must have at most eight
characters in the main section of the file name, and a three character
extention, which usually describes the type of the file.  This is a
peculiarity of DOS, so if you are used to using another operating
system (for example Macintoshes or UNIX machines), this may be a
little unusual.  An example of a
legal file name is <CODE>prog0001.cpp</CODE>.  Two illegal filenames
are <CODE>program25.cpp</CODE> and <CODE>prog0001.cppp</CODE>.

<P>
When in the <em>File Manager</em> and attempting to copy (for example) the
<CODE>prog0.dat</CODE> file, if you drag the file from the TA's
directory and drop it onto the <CODE>U:</CODE> drive icon, it will copy the file into current directory for the <CODE>U:</CODE> drive...which
is usually the <CODE>Windows</CODE> directory.  This leads to problems
because our programs are looking for files to be in the root directory.


<P>
Make sure to close down windows before leaving the lab, otherwise, you
will remain logged in.  This means someone else can muck around with
your stuff!
