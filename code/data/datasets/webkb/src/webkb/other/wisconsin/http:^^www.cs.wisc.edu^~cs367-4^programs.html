</CENTER>

<P>Five programs will be assigned during the semester.  Programs count for
50% of your final grade.  Programs take from 30 to 40 hours for the average
student to complete.  You should expect to spend considerable time doing
work outside of class for CS367 (this is typical for most CS courses since
it helps immensely in learning the material).

<P>Develop your class(es) and main program using multiple files, and
coordinating compilation using a makefile.  Break the problem down into
parts, and develop your program incrementally, rather than trying to code
it all at once.  See <!WA0><A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs367-4/working/working.html"> Working with C++ in
UNIX</A> for more information about organizing your files, compiling
multiple files using <CODE>make</CODE>, and using the debuggers.

<P>The programs will be linked to the list below as they are assigned.  Be
sure to read and follow the <!WA1><A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs367-4/standards.html"> grading standards</A>
for each assignment.

<P>Once you have completed an assignment, you will need to create an
<!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs367-4/working/script.html">output file</A> with test cases that
demonstrate your program.  Then follow the
<!WA3><A HREF = "http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs367-4/working/handin.html">handin procedure</A>.  I suggest that you
plan on finishing at least a day before the due date.

<P>If you find that you are having difficulty finishing an assignment, or
are just running out of time, rather engaging in some form of
<!WA4><A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs367-4/misconduct.html">academic misconduct</A>, see the TAs or me for
help, or make use of the <!WA5><A HREF = "http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs367-4/late.html">late policy</A>.
