<h1> Objectives For CS302</h1>

By the end of the semester, students should:

<ol>
	<li> <b> Be able to solve problems </b> <br>
       Understand how to solve problems using Object-Oriented techniques
       to reduce problems into manageable parts.
       
	<li> <b> Be able to program solutions </b> <br>
       Incrementally create C++ programs that implement the robust
       user friendly solutions with good programming style.

	<li> <b> Be able to use tools </b> <br>
       Have a good working knowledge of the tools used by programmers
       (i.e. compilers, debuggers, editors, and possibly others).

	<li> <b> Be prepared and motivated to take further CS courses </b> <br>
       Be prepared and also motivated to take further CS courses especially
       CS367.  CS302 - CS367 courses currently provide the programming
       foundation for higher level CS courses.  Note CS302 is a listed
       prereq. for 352, 354, 364, 367, 412, 425, 458, 513, 514, and 526.
       
</ol>

The course format is chosen for several reasons:

<ol>
   <li>to allow for a high degree of student-instructor interaction <br>
       - so students can freely ask/answer questions
	
   <li>to insure that each student is actively engaged with the material <br>
       - so students get individual attention and encouragment to participate

   <li>to allow for a variety of teaching techniques to be used <br>
       - lecturing but also individual and group work, fun and games?

   <li>to address the diversity of aptitude and interests of students <br>
       - smaller sections makes it easier for the pace, and examples to be
         tailored to the interests and abilities of the class.

   <li>to give interested grads an oportunity for teaching experience <br>
       - this is not common in most departments and is considered a service
         that the cs department provides to its grads
</ol>
