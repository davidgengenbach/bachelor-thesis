<h2><!WA0><a href="http://cgi.cs.wisc.edu/scripts/mbirk/proj_list_test_no_passwd">
Project Licp: No match.
p> What is <em>Project List</em>?  It is a small program (or script) that
manages a simple interface for viewing and modifying a "project list" - a
list of project descriptions, their authors, and hypertext links - on the
World Wide Web.  Since the interface is Web-based, the project list can be
easily examined or modified from just about anywhere, by anyone.

<p> <em>Project List</em> is for you if you are teaching a class (an
upper-level CS course, perhaps) in which your students work on substantial
projects, and you want to allow them to make information about their
projects publicly and easily accessible.

<p> <em>Project List</em> has three password modes.  You can try out
any of them:

<ul>
<li> <!WA1><a href="http://cgi.cs.wisc.edu/scripts/mbirk/proj_list_test_no_passwd">
     No passwords</a> used at all
<li> A single <!WA2><a href="http://cgi.cs.wisc.edu/scripts/mbirk/proj_list_test_class_passwd">
     class password</a> which must be used to modify the list
<li> <!WA3><a href="http://cgi.cs.wisc.edu/scripts/mbirk/proj_list_test_ind_passwd">
     Individual passwords</a> for each project (anyone can add to the list)
</ul>
</ul>

<h3> Installation </h3>

<p> If you are in the UW-CS department, then installation should be almost
    trivial.  You can <!WA4><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~mbirk/proj_list/install_proj_list">download the install
    program</a> or run it directly by typing:

<pre>
      ~mbirk/public/html/proj_list/install_proj_list
</pre>

when logged into your UNIX account.  (Of course, simply running this program
blindly is a security risk, but there's nothing stopping you from looking
at the script first.  Look before leaping!)  If you want to have more than one
project list, simply run the install program multiple times.

<p> <b>Note:</b> To use the <em>Project List</em> program at UW-CS, you must first
obtain a <!WA5><a href="http://cgi.cs.wisc.edu/instructions">CGI directory</a>.
To do this, send email to <!WA6><a href="mailto:www@cs.wisc.edu">www@cs.wisc.edu</a>,
and ask for a CGI directory to be created for you.

<h3> Using <em>Project List</em> </h3>

<p> Once you've installed <em>Project List</em>, using it to view or
modify the project list is a snap: you simply run the script by using
the correct Web address (URL).  For instance, you can test out
<em>Project List</em> with the following URL:

<pre>
      <!WA7><a href="http://cgi.cs.wisc.edu/scripts/mbirk/proj_list_test_no_passwd">http://cgi.cs.wisc.edu/scripts/mbirk/proj_list_test_no_passwd</a>
</pre>

<p> There are some other things you might want to know:

<ul> 
<li> The <tt>proj_list</tt> program creates a file with a <tt>.db</tt>
extension in your data directory. This is simply a text file containing the
list information.  Fields (description, authors, web reference, and
password) are separated by <tt>TAB</tt> characters; rows, or items, are
separated by newlines.  Thus it is very simply to edit by hand.
<li> You can empty the list by simply deleting the <tt>.db</tt> file (or
renaming it).  
</ul>

<h3> Technical Information </h3>

<p> <!WA8><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~mbirk/proj_list/proj_list"><tt>proj_list</tt></a> is a 
<!WA9><a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/overview.html">CGI</a>
script written in the
<!WA10><a href="http://www.mit.edu:8001/perl/perl.html">Perl 5</a> scripting language.
<em>Project List</em> uses the <!WA11><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~mbirk/proj_list/CGI.pm-2.1">CGI.pm</a> perl extension,
which makes it easy to create CGI programs that use forms (text input
fields, buttons, etc).
