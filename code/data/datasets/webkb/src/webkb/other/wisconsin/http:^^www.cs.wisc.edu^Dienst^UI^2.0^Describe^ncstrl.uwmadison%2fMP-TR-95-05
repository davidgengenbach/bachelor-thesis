 Given two finite point sets \SA and \SB in the n-dimensional real space <i>R^n</i>, we consider the NP-complete problem of minimizing the number of misclassified points by a plane attempting to divide <i>R^n</i> into two halfspaces such that each open halfspace contains points mostly of \SA or \SB. This problem is equivalent to determining a plane <i>\{ x \mid x^T w= \gamma \}</i> that maximizes the number of points <i>x \in </i> \SA satisfying <i>x^T w > \gamma</i>, plus the number of points <i>x \in</i> \SB satisfying <i>x^T w < \gamma</i>. A simple but fast algorithm is proposed that alternates between (i) minimizing the number of misclassified points by translation of the separating plane, and (ii) a rotation of the plane so that it minimizes a weighted average sum of the distances of the misclassified points to the separating plane. Existence of a global solution to an underlying hybrid minimization problem is established. Computational comparison with a parametric approach to solve the NP-complete problem indicates that our approach is considerably faster and appears to generalize better as determined by tenfold cross-validation.<P>
