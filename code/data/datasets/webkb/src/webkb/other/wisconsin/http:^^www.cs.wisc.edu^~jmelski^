welcome to the second incarnation of eric melski's homepage.
<p>
<!WA3><img src="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~jmelski/me3.jpg" align=left>
this page used to be about me, but i don't think most people really want 
to know my life story.  still, i feel that i must say at least something 
about myself.  i'm 19, a sophomore at the 
university of wisconsin in madison, and i'm majoring in computer science. 
i enjoy computer programming, alternative music, and life in general.
<p>
i work at the computer systems lab at the university, where i have 
recently taken over as dumpmaster. this is good because now i have a 
title with the word 'master' in it. i retain my cookie purchasing duties, 
as i am the only person i trust to get good cookies.
<p>
i'm originally from marshfield, wi, and before that, from newton, ma.  
but for now, madison is where i belong.
<p>
explore my pages.
