 Given an arbitrary program dependence graph, the algorithm ReconstituteProgram determines whether the graph is \fIfeasible\fP (\fIi.e.\fP, is the dependence graph of some program), and if so produces such a program. ReconstituteProgram is currently used for program integration, and has the potential to be used by other algorithms that manipulate program dependence graphs. This paper corrects a minor error that was in the original definition of ReconstituteProgram, and proves that the new version of the algorithm is correct.<P>
