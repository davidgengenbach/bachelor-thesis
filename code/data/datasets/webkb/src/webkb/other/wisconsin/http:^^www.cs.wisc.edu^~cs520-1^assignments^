    <h1>cs520 assignments</h1>

    Fall 1996
    <p>

    Assignments are to be handed in, on paper, at the start of lecture.
    If you will be absent from lecture, assignments may be placed in
    my mailbox <b>before lecture starts</b> on the day they are due.
    My mailbox is labled with "Brian Cole" in black letters on
    lavender paper, and is on the fifth floor of the Computer Sciences
    building (green elevators).
    <p>

    Late policy: Assignments turned in up to one lecture period late
                 are assessed a 20% penalty.
                 Assignments turned in more than one lecture period
                 late will not be graded.
                 Exceptions can be granted, rarely, but only if
                 arranged <b>in advance</b> of the due date.
    <p>
