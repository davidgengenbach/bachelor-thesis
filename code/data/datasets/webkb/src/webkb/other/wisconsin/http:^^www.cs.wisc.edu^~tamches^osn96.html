We had more people sign up than there are available slots. So,
some people signed up for a waiting list (you know who you are).
They'll get first dibs for next semester's seminar:

<h2> Choosing a Talk </h2>
The first choice is to give a talk on research which you are doing.
Alternatively, you can give a talk on just about anything related to
operating systems.  I've put together a list of recent conference papers
which should make for interesting talks.  (Of course, you don't need to limit
your choices to this list; they're just suggestions.)
The papers are mostly from <!WA12><!WA12><!WA12><!WA12><!WA12><!WA12><a href="http://www-ece.rice.edu/SOSP15/paper-list.html">SOSP 15</a>
