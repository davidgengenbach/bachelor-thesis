<p>Hi Netsurfer,<br><br>

 I am a grad student at Wisconsin-Madison. If u dont know , Madison has been rated the second most liveable city in the whole of the US and is the capital of Wisconsin. Univ of Wisconsin-Madison is the third largest campus in the US and the CS dept has been ranked as the second best in the whole country for Databases. <br><br>

I come from India, a land of peace , spices and heat ( I really miss the hot weather )<br><br>

I am currently doing my graduate work in <!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><A Href = "http://www.cs.wisc.edu "> Computer Sciences </A> ( No specialisation yet !! But I like Networks and Databases ). My <blink> RESUME </blink> is available here in <!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><A HREF = "http://www.cs.wisc.edu/resume.txt"> ASCII </A> and in <!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><A HREF = "http://www.cs.wisc.edu/resume.ps" > Postscript  </A> versions.<br><br> 

My undergrad degree was from <!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><A HREF  = "http://www.engr.uky.edu/~arunp/ceg.html" > CEG </A> - College of Engineering , Guindy , a nice big College in  <!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><A HREF = "http://www.eel.ufl.edu/~sriraj/madraspics.html"> Chennai (Madras)  </A>, <!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><A HREF  = "http://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~srinivas/indial.html#ind1" > India </A> , that has been there for 200 years.<br><br>

I love to travel and adventure . As they say "Travel is an adventure" and I get lots of it ! U name it and I ve had it !- Like wandering alone in London, getting stranded at an airport ,.. and so on. And I really wanna get some  "real " adventure. As far as I am concerned , Alls well that ends well!<br><br>

I also love gardening , having pets , listening to weather reports and news ! <br><br>

Signing off , <br><br>
