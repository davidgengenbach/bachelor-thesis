<h1>Welcome Quince Beta Testers!</h1>

This is a work in progress.  Some features are obviously not
implemented yet.  Most notably, I haven't written the Quince server;
so what you see is just a dumb front-end.  Please <!WA3><A
HREF="mailto:ben@cs.wisc.edu">mail me</A> if you find any bugs or have
constructive criticism of any kind (other than to get a life!).<br><br>
Thanks for your feedback,<br>

<h2>Known Problems</h2>
<h3>Netscape 3.0 for Unix</h3>
	<ul>
	<li> Deletion from the word list is broken. 
	</ul>
<h3>Explorer 3.0 for Win95</h3>
	<ul>
	<li> There seem to be occasional white stripes across the board and the
timer -- they're covered by the board/timer, but they show just a little
at the sides.  Hard to describe...  I couldn't figure out a pattern to
when they appear and disappear. -Dan Prince
	</ul>

<h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
	<ul>
	<li> Goal: find as many words on the board as you can in three minutes.
	<li> Valid words consist of a sequence of neighboring tiles from the board.
	<li> The neighbors of a tile are the tiles bordering it in all directions - vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.
	<li> A tile may not be re-used in spelling a word.
	<li> Words must be four letters or longer.
	<li> If playing Euclidian, edge tiles have fewer than eight neighbors.  
	<li> If playing non-Euclidian, the neighbors of an edge tile are considered to "wrap around" the board.
	</ul>

<h2>Entering Words</h2>
	<ul>
	<li> Enter words either by dragging them out on the board or typing
	  	  them into the text box below the board.
   <li> Erroneously entered words can be deleted from the word list by selecting the mistake and pressing <i>Delete</i> or <i>Backspace</i>.
	<li> When dragging out a word, you can back up by dragging over the tile just before the tail of your selection.
	<li> When dragging out a word, wou can press and hold the <i>Shift</i> key to disable selection; this is useful when selecting wrapped words in Non-Euclidian mode.
	<li> Clicking on the word list to the right of the screen displays the word on the board.
	<li> Clicking on the buttons beneath the board has the following effects:
		<ul>
		<li> "<" - rotates the board counter-clockwise
		<li> "-" - flips the board vertically 
		<li> ">" - rotates the board clockwise
		</ul>
	</ul>

<h2>Sequence of Play</h2>
	<ul>
	<li> When you first enter Quince, a dialog box appears asking you to provide a name for yourself and select a language (English only at first).
	<li> Browse the channels of the Quince server with the channel selector.
	<li> When you find a game that you what to join, click on the "Join" button.
	<li> When that game enters a new round, you can begin playing.

	<li> At the conclusion of a round, a window will appear that shows:
		<ul>
			<li> The words found by each player not found by any other player.
			<li> All the words found by the Quince server.
			<li> Words found by a player, but not by any other player or by the Quince server are flagged as questionable.
			<li> Point summaries for all players.
		</ul>
	<li> You have 30 seconds to review the results of a round before the next round begins.
	</ul>

<h2>Scoring</h2>
	<ul>
	<li> Points are only awarded for words that you find that no other player found.
	<li> 1 point for a four-letter word
	<li> 2 points for a five-letter word
	<li> 3 points for a six-letter word
	<li> etc...
	</ul>
