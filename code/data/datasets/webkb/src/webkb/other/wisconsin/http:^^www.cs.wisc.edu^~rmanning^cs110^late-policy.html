<H1> Late Policy </H1>

Try to get your program done by the beginning of class the day it is due, so
you can turn in your printout to me directly. 

<P> However, I will officially allow you to work until the Vectra lab closes
on the day the assignment is due.  BUT: in this case it is your
responsibility to make sure a printout of the program gets to me.
Sliding the printout under my office door (room 1349) might be a good
way to do this... 

<P> If your program is in by the official deadline, no points will be
deducted for lateness.  Unofficially, if you get your program in
before I start grading them I won't deduct any points either.  BUT:
you never know when I'm going to grade the programs so you're taking
your chances if you go this route. 

<P> This is a credit/no credit course; if you learn how to program and
it shows in your assignments then you'll get credit, so don't
stress-out.  If you slack-off and don't do the assignments, or if
you're just not picking-up the concepts, then you'll get no credit.  

<P> Have fun with the programs and play around with the features of
C--that's the best way to master the language.
