<LI>To be on time, your paper copy of the program must be handed in by the 
<B> BEGINNING </B> of class on the day it is due. <br><br>

<LI>You will be allowed to turn <B>ONE</B> program up to one class period 
late with no penalty on the condition that you send me an E-mail message at 
least 48 hours before the deadline.  You may use this extension for any 
reason (e.g. the Packers were playing the Lions) but I highly recommend that you 
wait until you really need it.<br><br>

<LI>You will be allowed to turn <B>THREE</B> programs up to one class period 
late with a twenty percent (20%) penalty.  After this quota is met, all 
late programs will be accepted only under extreme circumstances (e.g. severe 
illness, death) and require 48 hours notice prior to the set due date.<br><br>

<LI>Programs more than one class period late have the same policy as a fourth 
(or more) late program (see above).<br><br>
