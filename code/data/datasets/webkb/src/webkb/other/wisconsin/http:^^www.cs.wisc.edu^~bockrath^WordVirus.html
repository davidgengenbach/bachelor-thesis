<html><title>Word Virus</title>
<body>
This virus has been going around, if you have Microsoft Word, please
check your system.

(This info is from Tech-partners)
The "Concept" virus is written using a WordBasic auto macro, which
means that it can affect both Macintosh and Windows versions of
Word 6, and  Word 7 for Windows '95. The current version is harmless
but there is no reason why it could not be altered to be harmful;
anyone who has the virus has the source code.

virus (excerpted from their tech-note #Q134727 in the
