<title>Golfing at Torrey Pines</title>

I was in San Diego in June attending a conference, 
and I took the opportunity to hop over for some
Golf at Torrey Pines Municipal GC, the home of the
Buick Invitational. I paid through my nose but came
away with a photograph or two for my trouble. This
is on the 165 yard Par3 6th hole on the North course.
<p>

Can you figure out what's wrong with the photograph?

p.s. No, it's not the terrible
form at the top of the backswing. That has been fixed. :)
