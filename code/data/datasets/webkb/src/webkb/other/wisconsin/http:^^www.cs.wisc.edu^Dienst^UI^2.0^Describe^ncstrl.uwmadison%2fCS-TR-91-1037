<H2>Dependence-Based Representations for Programs with Reference Variables </H2>

 Three features common to modern programming languages are popular because they simplify the development of efficient programs. The first, the assignment statement, allows the components of a data structure to be redefined as a computation progresses. The second, dynamic allocation, allows memory for data structures to be acquired, destroyed, and reused at need. The third, the reference (i.e., pointer) variable, allows multiple data structures to share a common substructure. These three features, unfortunately, make it difficult to estimate program behavior at compile-time. Such estimates play a crucial role in the (automatic) improvement, modification, and reuse of existing software.<P>
