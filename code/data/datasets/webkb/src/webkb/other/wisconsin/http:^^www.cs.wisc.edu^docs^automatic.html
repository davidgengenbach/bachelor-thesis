<H1>Automatically Indexed Documents</H1>

The Web server runs a script three times a day to check for HTML files with
special names in people's home directories.  If these files exist, they are
linked into master lists for easy accessibility.  The auto-indexed pages
currently include:

<UL>
  <LI> <!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><A HREF="#homepages">``Home'' or ``signature'' pages</A>
  <LI> <!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><A HREF="#classes">Classes pages</A>
</UL>

<A NAME="homepages"><H2>``Home'' or ``signature'' pages</H2></A>

Directories of Computer Sciences
<!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/directories/facstafflist.html">Faculty and Research Staff</A>,
<!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/directories/gradlist.html">Graduate Students</A>, and
<!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><!WA4><A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/directories/csmajors.html">Undergraduate Majors</A> are 
automatically generated. Links to home pages are included for
every file with the name 
<TT>~<EM>username</EM>/public/html/<EM>username</EM>.html</TT> in the 
<!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/csl/faq/software/afs.html">AFS</A> filesystem.  (This isn't true
yet.  Currently only those accounts that fit into the above lists are
indexed.  We will be adding a catch-all ``other'' list soon.)
<P>
Remember that our server translates <TT>~</TT><EM>username</EM> to 
<TT>~<EM>username</EM>/public/html</TT>, so the URL for user Joe's homepage, 
for example, would be <TT>http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~joe/joe.html</TT>, even 
though it is stored in the filesystem at <TT>~joe/public/html/joe.html</TT>.
<P>

<A NAME="classes"><H2>Class pages</H2></A>

Pages for <!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/directories/classes.html">classes</A> are looked for 
in two places.  The first is any file
matching the pattern <TT>~cs(course_number)-(section)/public/html/cs(course_number)</EM>.html</TT>.  The second is any with the same name,
but in the course instructor's account instead of the course account.  The
second form is the only one available to cs302 instructors.  <P>
