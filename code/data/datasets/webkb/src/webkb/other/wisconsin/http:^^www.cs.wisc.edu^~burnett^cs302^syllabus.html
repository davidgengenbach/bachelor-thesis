<h3>CS302-63 Syllabus</h3><p>
This page will be expanded/revised during the first few weeks.  Thank you
for your patience!<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Exams</b> (3) - 60% (20% each)
<li><b>Quizzes</b> (3-5) - 10% (equally weighted)
<li><b>Programs</b> (9) - 30% (<em>probably</em> equally weighted)
</ul>

<a href="syllabus.txt">Approximate Timetable</a> - this will give you a rough
idea as to the pace and ordering of the topics-to-be-covered.  You are
responsible for any "adjustments" made in class.
<p>
<b>Late Policy</b>: Your paper copy of the program must be handed in by the 
<em>beginning</em> of class on the day it is due.  The electronic copy will
not be used to determine the handin time.  Make sure that the paper copy
matches the electronic one; if it doesn't, then I will probably consider
the electronic copy a late submission.<p>

Programs will generally be due on a Tuesday.  In this case, you may hand
in a program up to 3 days late, and there will be a 15% deduction
for each late day.  Thursday submissions: paper copy must be handed in by
the <em>beginning</em> of class.  Wednesday and Friday submissions: paper
copy must be handed <em>directly to me</em> during my office hours.
