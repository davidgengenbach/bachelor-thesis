<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Program 2</H1>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Due Wednesday, September 25, 1996</H3> 
<hr><br>

In program 2, you are a computer programmer who has been hired by
a local restaurant to write a program for a new computer which will
replace an old cash register.  

<p>
The restaurant only has four items on the menu.  You may pick what those
items are and set prices for them (each item must have a different price).
You need to keep a running total of what is ordered and keep looping until
the cash register operator asks the program to print out the total bill.
Also, you need to keep track of how many of each item are purchased and
display them in the final bill.  Be creative with the name
of your restaurant, what sorts of food your restaurant offers, and what
the prices are (<I>ie, make up your own... don't just copy mine!</I>).

<p>
Here is an example of what your menu might look like.  The formatting
does not need to be exactly like this, but all dollar amounts must be
formatted to 2 decimal places.
<PRE>
 	 The Hamburger Shack
	 -------------------------------
	 A.  Hamburger            $1.00
	 B.  Cheeseburger         $1.20
	 C.  Double Cheeseburger  $2.40
	 D.  Bacon Cheeseburger   $2.00

	 Current Subtotal:  $0.00
	 Enter your selection -->
</PRE>

<p>
At this point, the cash register operator might press "A" (or, s/he 
might press "a".  Your program should do the same thing either way).
You should add the cost of item A to the running subtotal and ask
the operator if they are ready to print the final bill (the operator
will enter "Y", "y", "N", or "n" as an answer).  If the
operator is not ready to print the bill yet, redisplay the menu 
with the updated subtotal:
<PRE>
	Enter your selection -->  <B>A</B>

	New subtotal is $1.00
	Would you like to print the bill now (Y or N)?  <B>N</B>

 	The Hamburger Shack
	-------------------------------
	[...print your choices again...]

	Current Subtotal: $1.00
	Enter your selection --> 
</PRE>

<p>
When the operator says that, yes, s/he would like to print out a
final bill, your program should print out an itemized list of what
was ordered (and the total cost for each item), the subtotal, the
sales tax (use 5% for sales tax), and the total (subtotal +
sales tax).  For example:
<PRE>
	[...]
	Would you like to print the bill now (Y or N)?  <B>Y</B>

	Customer Bill
	-------------
	1 Hamburger	      $1.00
	2 Cheeseburger	      $2.40
	1 Bacon Cheeseburger  $2.00
			     ------
	Subtotal              $5.40
	Sales Tax             $0.27
                             ======
	Amount Due            $5.67
</PRE>

<p>
Notice that two cheeseburgers were ordered in this example, so the
cost is listed as 2 times $1.20, or $2.40.  Also notice that since
no double cheeseburgers were ordered, they are not mentioned on
the bill (it does not say "<tt>0 Double Cheeseburger</tt>").  The
program should stop executing after the final bill is printed.

<p>
<H3>What To Turn In</H3>

Once you have your program working, use the print capabilities of the
Borland output window (click on the upper left square in the output window
and then select "Print") to a create a printout of output which
demonstrates all of the features of your program.  Your output printout
should at least demonstrate ordering one of some item, ordering more than
one of some item, and not ordering any of a third item.  Submit print-outs
of both your source code and your output and an electronic copy of your
source code and executable file as before.
