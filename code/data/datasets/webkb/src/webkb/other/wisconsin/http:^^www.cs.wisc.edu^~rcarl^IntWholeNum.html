<P> <H2>math990 section 6 Introduction to Whole Numbers (Fall 1996)</H2>
<BR>

<H3>Summary</H3>
This course is designed to give a student a firm understanding of the concepts of
whole numbers.  Since this is an introductory class, emphasis will be placed on the 
idea of the number 1.  Depending on how well the class grasps this difficult concept,
we may even get to the number 2.  The text for this class is "Counting to One, I 
love to count!" by The Count.  When this class is completed, the student should 
have the ability to count to the number 1 starting from 0. (Note:  The number and 
concept of 0 is covered in math 890: Introduction to Nothing).


<h3>Grading</h3>
This class has several exams, each one based upon the scheduled weekly topic.  Each
exam will count for 1% of the grade.  Class participation is required.
