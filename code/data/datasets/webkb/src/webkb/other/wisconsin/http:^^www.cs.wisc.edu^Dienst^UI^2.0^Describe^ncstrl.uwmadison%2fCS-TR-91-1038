 The magnitude and complexity of existing and future software systems heightens the need for tools that assist programmers with the task of maintaining and developing software. One recurring problem that arises in system development is the need to reconcile multiple divergent lines of program development. When solved by hand, this reconciliation or integration process is often tedious and error prone. A better solution is the use of a \fIprogram integration tool\fP\(ema tool that takes as input several variants of a @base@ program, automatically determines the changes in each variant with respect to the @base@ program, and incorporates these changes, along with the portion of the @base@ program preserved in all the variants, into a merged program.<P>
