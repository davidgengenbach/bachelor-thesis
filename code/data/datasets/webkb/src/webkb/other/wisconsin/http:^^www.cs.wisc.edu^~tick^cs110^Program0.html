<DT>Due Date:
<DD>Friday 11/1/96, 5:00 pm<P>
<DT>Grade:
<DD>4% of your final grade.<P>
<DT>Text Covered:
<DD>None<P>
<DT>Problem Description:<p>
<DD>Program0 requires you to do no programming of your own, nor are you required at this point to understand what the program is doing (although it may make a little more sense once you run it). It's simply intended to get you used to using the PC's, MS-DOS, and Microsoft Fortran.
<p>
<li>Send me e-mail (tick@cs.wisc.edu) indicating which
email address you send and receive your mail from. <p>
<li>You need to be registered for this class in order to be given an account on the Vectras. The account will take about 2 days to set-up after you register. If your account won't be set-up yet by the due date of this program, let me know <STRONG>immediately</STRONG>.<p>  
<li>Check out <!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><A href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~tick/cs110/Short.html">the basics of using Fortran on the PC's</A>. This will tell you exactly what to do; just read the following comments below, then follow the steps.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Note that step 10 talks about copying additional files. For this program, you'll want to copy a file called prog0.dat (that's a zero, not the letter O) into your working directory.     
<p>
<li>When you type this program in, use your name instead of mine where it appears
near the top of the program. Also, make sure that you type this *exactly*
as you see it. The C's and line #s must be in the very first column, and
the rest (i.e. PROGRAM ZERO, IMPLICIT NONE, etc) must be in column 7...Use
the TAB key to jump to column 7.<p>
<li>Here is the program to type in (step 13):
