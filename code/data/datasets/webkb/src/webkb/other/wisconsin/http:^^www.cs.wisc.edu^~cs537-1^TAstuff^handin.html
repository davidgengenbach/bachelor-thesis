</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<H3>Hand-in Procedure</H3>
<P>
The procedure for handing in project 2 (and the rest of the projects
this semester) will be a little different than for project 1.
You should follow the guidelines below:
<UL>
<LI>Bring a <B>hard copy</B> of all your <FONT COLOR=#0000FF>.java
</FONT><FONT COLOR=#000000>files to class on the day the program
is due (if you do not want to lose late days). </FONT>
<LI>Submit an <B>electronic version</B> of <B>all</B> you files
(.java, makefile, output files, etc.) to the hand-in directory
of <I>either</I> you or your partner.  Your hand-in directory
for project 2 is in: <TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">~cs537-1/public/handin/project2.
</FONT></TT>If you are programming at home using the <I>Windows
95</I> version of Java, you will still need to hand in your code
on-line (and you should make sure it works in the Solaris environment
- which will entail adding the ThreadScheduler code).  
<LI>Add a <FONT COLOR=#0000FF>README</FONT> file to your electronic
hand-in directory that contains the following:
<OL>
<LI>Name of you and your partner.
<LI>Project information (project number, date, etc.).
<LI>Information on how to run your program.
<LI>A brief map of the classes you have written and what they
do.
<LI>Any other information you feel is important for the ta to
know.
</OL>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Output Files</H3>
<P>
 You should <B>not</B> hand in a hard copy of your output (it
will use too much paper).  Instead you should run the tests required
by the assignment and output the results to a file.  I would prefer
if you could create separate files for each test (e.g.: <TT>Alg1Peterson.test,
Alg2Peterson.test, Alg1Star.test, Alg2Star.test</TT>.) instead
of having everything bunched together into a single typescript
file.  You can do this by redirecting the output.  The format
of the output is described in the assignment.<BR>
<H3>Comments</H3>
<P>
 Comments are going to be worth <I>at least</I> 10% of the grade
for this assignment.  So if you do not want to lose any of the
points, you should follow the guidelines below:
<OL>
<LI>You should write your name and your partner's name, the assignment
number, and the hand-in date at the top of all your .java files
as well as give a brief description of what the file contains.
<LI>You should comment your variables so we know how they are
used.
<LI>Functions should be commented as to their purpose, what variables
are being passed in, what value is being returned (if any), as
well as any side effects.
<LI>You should document segments of code and provide the purpose
of each.  Particularly difficult segments of code will require
more commenting.
</OL>
<H3>Program Structure</H3>
<P>
 Program structure will also be worth <I>at least</I> 10%.  Some
guidelines follow:
<OL>
<LI>Your code should be correctly indented.
<LI>You code should have blank lines separating different segments
of code.
<LI>Variable names should have meaning.
<LI>Curly brackets should be correctly lined-up.
</OL>
