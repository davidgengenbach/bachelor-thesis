<h2>Todo List</h2>

These aren't in any particular order because I have trouble prioritizing.
If you think I could be making better use of my time, feel free to 
make your own todo list for me, just as long as I don't have to see it.<P>

I will sometimes not modify this file for long periods of time. <P>
