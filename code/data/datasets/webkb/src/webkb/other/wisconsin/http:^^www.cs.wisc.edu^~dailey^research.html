<strong>University of Utah, Physics Department:</strong> <BR>
Advisor: Eugene Loh, Cosmic Ray Research Group
<DL>
   <DT>Summer '91
      <DD>Designed, built, and tested a model system of optical fibers
	to be implemented as a part of the mirror calibration system of the 
	HiRes Fly's Eye currently being built.<BR>
	Co-worker: Zhen Liu
   <DT>Summer '92
      <DD>Designed, built, and constructed a "moon scope" - a portable
	calibrated instrument that would allow a comparison of the 
	atmosphere's ability to transmit light at different sites using a 
	common light source (the moon).
