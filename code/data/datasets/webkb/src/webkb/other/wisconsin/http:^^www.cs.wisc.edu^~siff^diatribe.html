<H1>Philosophy of the World Wide Web</H1>


<P>
This is <EM>my</EM> philosophy about the Web. It, in no way
represents, as far as I can tell, what anyone else thinks. The Web is a
<EM>public</EM> place. Therefore people should present <EM>personal</EM>
information on their web pages only if they are of the mind that their
lives "are open books." I myself susbscribe to the notion of privacy. Thus,
this URL is as personal as my web pages will get.

<!-- <P> Computers, the Internet, and the World Wide Web have become so
fast and so big that they seem infinite in their capabilities. They are
not. There is a tendency to waste bytes just as people used to waste
electricity, water, paper, or anything else. Notable examples include chain
e-mail messages, which waste bandwith on the Internet and delay
communications that might possibly have some relevance to something. Also,
Web documents and their users who seem obssessed with high resolution
pictures and animated clips. Again, thesThe World Wide Web is fun and
useful. The remainder of web site is designed to show what I feel are some
things that both fun and useful.
