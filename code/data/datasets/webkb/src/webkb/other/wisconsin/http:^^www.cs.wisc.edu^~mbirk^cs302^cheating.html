<center> <h2> Cheating and Academic Misconduct </h2> </center>

<p> Academic misconduct is a serious issue in a university.
The Computer Sciences Department therefore deals with this problem
in a serious manner.  Academic misconduct encompasses the acts of
presenting work as your own which is in part or in whole of someone
else's authorship, of giving your own work to another student, or of
misrepresenting your work in some other way.  A simple rule of thumb
is not to look at someone else's code or allow someone else to look at 
your code in any form.  In addition, don't discuss program design with
someone else to the extent that you are actually discussing the code itself.

<p> It is also considered academic misconduct to misrepresent your work
in any way.  If you turn in a hard copy of a program that does not match
the code on your disk, or if you turn in output that has been altered in
any way or which was not created by running the program you have written,
then you have committed academic misconduct.

<p> The usual sanction for academic misconduct is for the students
involved to be withdrawn from the course and explanatory letters to
be placed in their academic files.  At the very least, zeros are recorded
for the assignment in question.  Cheating is an unsavory situation, and
instances of cheating can cause heartache and disappointment for everyone
involved.  It is something that we try hard to avoid.  To this end, we
want to make it clear that we will work with you in gaining command of
the course material.  Don't go to a friend and use part or all of their
code.  If you find you are having problems, PLEASE come in to my office
hours.  If you have any questions about how closely you can work with
someone, be they classmates or tutors, come in and ask me about it.
It is my goal that each and every one of you learn the course material
and I will do what I can to enable you to do just that.
