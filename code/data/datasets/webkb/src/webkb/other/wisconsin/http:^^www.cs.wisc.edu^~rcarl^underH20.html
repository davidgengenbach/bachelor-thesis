This course is designed to educate a student in the art of underwater fire 
prevention.  The text for this class is "Preventing Underwater Fires" by 
Smokey the Duck.  The class will be taught how to put out certain types of underwater
fires such as ocean-bottom brush-fires and lake bottom bonfires as well as the 
prevention of those types of fires.  Instruction will also be given as to how not to
accidentally light a match or a bic lighter underwater.

<h3>Grading</h3>
The grading consists of one project worth 75% of the grade.  This project will 
consist of starting an underwater brushfire and then putting that fire out.  The 
student may choose the location of the fire from the following list:  The bottom of
the Mariana Trench or the bottom of the center of the Bermuda Triangle.  The other
25% will come from class participation and a personal survival bonus.
