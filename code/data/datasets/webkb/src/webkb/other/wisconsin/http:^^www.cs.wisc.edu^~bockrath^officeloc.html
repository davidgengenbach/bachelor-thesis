<h3 >Where is CS 3310? </h3 >
Presumably, you are standing on Dayton Street, Outside the main entrance 
to the CS building. <br><br>
Go straight into the building, through both sets of double doors,<br> down 
the office hallway, to the cross corridor<br> which leads to Union South on 
the Left Side.<br><br>
Turn Right.  There is a Bulletin board which has pictures of the CS 
people on it,<br> a Gray door, and the door to room 1325.<br>  Enter the 
Gray door.<br><br>
Continue Down the Hallway until you see the Stairwell. Go Up Three 
flights of Stairs.<br> There will be a door with the Label (CS 3310) on 
it.<br> Enter this door.<BR><br>
Go up the 4 steps, Look out the window, turn right, and enter the First 
Door.<br>
I'm Sure that everyone will be happy to see you.<br> My desk is the first on 
the right.<br><br>
