<h1>
Andy "Krazy" Glew's<br>
Favorite Quotes and Sayings
</h1>

This collection started out as a set of IBM computer cards pasted
to the wall of McGill's McConnell Engineering Computer Facility,
where I operated the RJE site and provided programming advice,
was pasted to the glass wall of my office at Gould, 
and has followed me around.

<UL>
<LI>
Expressing my observation that many bugs in P6 were caused by incorrect
design of one dimensional pipelines, not the multi-pipeline decoupled nature
of P6.

"In times of profound change, the learners inherit the earth, while the
learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no
longer exists."
<br>
--- Al Rogers, Global SchoolHouse Network, speaking at CUE

<DL>
<DT>Glew comment:<DD>
    I wonder if there is some correlation between "liberal" 
    and "ability to learn and adapt to new things",
    so that liberalism is a trait that has a survival advantage
    in times of rapid change, 
    but which is of less advantage during the long intervals
    of less change.
    The computer industry may act as an example:
    profoundly liberal when it started,
    conservative now that the time of great innovations and new ideas has passed.
