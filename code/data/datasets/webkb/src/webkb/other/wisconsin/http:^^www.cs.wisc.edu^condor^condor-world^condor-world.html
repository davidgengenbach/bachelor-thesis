The Condor-World Mailing List
</H1>
<HR>

The Condor-World mailing list is intended for distribution and
exchange of information regarding the Condor software developed at the
University of Wisconsin - Madison, Computer Sciences Department.
Condor-World should serve as a means to exchange information and
experience relating to Condor.  We would also like to use it as a
channel for comments, wishes and complaints regarding the system.  As
we continue to work on the problem of batch processing in a cluster of
workstations, we would like to know what <EM>you</EM> think about the
system.
