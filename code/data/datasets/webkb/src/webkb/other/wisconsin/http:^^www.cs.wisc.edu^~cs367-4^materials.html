<H3>Required</H3>
<UL>
 <LI><I>Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with C++: Walls and Mirrors</I>,
     by Frank M. Carrano, Benjamin Cummings, 1995.  
     The text is required for the course and is currently available at the
     UW Bookstore.  If you intend to become a CS major, I recommend you
     keep this text as a reference.
 <LI><I>CS1000: A Basic UNIX Primer for courses in the UW-Madison CS Dept.</I>,
     <!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/csl/cs1000/">which is available
     on-line.</A>  Paper copies are also available from the DoIT Document Desk .
</UL>

<H3>Optional</H3>
<UL>
 <LI><I>C++ Primer</I>,
     by Stanley B. Lippman, 2nd Ed., Addison-Wesley, 1995.
     A recommended C++ Reference.
 <LI><I>The C++ Programmer's Handbook</I>,
     by Paul J. Lucas, Prentice-Hall, 1992.
     Another good C++ reference book.
 <LI><I>Problem Solving with C++: The Object of Programming</I>,
     by Walter Savitch, Addison-Wesley, 1996.
     This is the text used by the CS302 C++ sections.  It presents the
     C++ language assumming no programming experience.  I would suggest
     this text if you need to brush up on your programming skills.
 <LI><I>An Intro. to Object-Oriented Design in C++</I>,
     by Jo Ellen Perry and Harold D. Levin, Addison-Wesley, 1995.
     This text was used by the CS302 C++ sections last Fall and would also be
     suitable if you need to brush up on your programming skills.
 <LI><I>CS1000 supplement</I>
     Longer reference on vi and the csh shell. I recommend this for those
     who intend to major in CS.
 <LI><I>Vi Quick Reference</I>
     Document 2616 in the DoIT Customer Center.
     Lists more commands than the introduction in <I>CS1000,</I> above.
 <LI><I>GNU Emacs Reference Card</I>
     Document 2625 in the DoIT Customer Center.
     Useful if you choose to use emacs instead of vi.
