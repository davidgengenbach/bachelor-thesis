Tyger! Tyger! burning bright <BR>
In the forests of the night.<BR>
What Immortal hand or eye<BR>
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?<BR>
<P>
In what distant deeps or skies<BR>
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<BR>
On what wings dare he aspire?<BR>
What the hand, dare seize the fire?<BR>
<P>
And what shoulder, and what art,<BR>
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<BR>
And when thy heart begin to beat,<BR>
What dread hand? and what dread feet?<BR>
<P>
What the hammer?  What the chain?<BR>
In what furnace was thy brain?<BR>
What the anvil?  what dread grasp<BR>
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?<BR>
<P>
When the stars threw down their spears,<BR>
And water'd heaven with their tears,<BR>
Did he smile his work to see?<BR>
Did he who made the lamb make thee?<BR>
<P>
Tyger! Tyger! burning bright,<BR>
In the forests of the night.<BR>
What Immortal hand or eye<BR>
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?<BR>
