<H2>What is SL 2.0 ? </H2>

The simulation library (SL) is a collection of C-language
functions that provide a framework in which to develop computer
simulations of 2D robotic systems. SL helps a programmer concentrate
solely on implementation issues specific to his/her simulation, such as
a particular motion planning algorithm or a new type of kinematic
structure. The idea is to (1) simplify and standardize the low-level
aspects of most simulation programs (e.g., graphics, user-interface
construction, run time interactivity), and (2) factor out the
repetitive steps specific to writing simulations in robotics.
For example, many simulations involve constructing and drawing
a robot in its environment. SL addresses that by providing a
high-level C-language interface in which to define, draw, and animate
a robot, its environment, and the interaction between these two.  <P>

The library supports:

<UL>
<LI> User-interface construction and run-time interaction
<LI> Drawing and manipulation of geometric primitives
<LI> Color and animation
<LI> 2D modeling transformations
<LI> Obstacle database management
<LI> Sensor-based motion-planning algorithms
<LI> Modeling and manipulation of 2D robots
</UL>

<H2>Downloading and installing SL</H2>

The library can be obtained via anonymous ftp from robios8.me.wisc.edu
in directory /pub/SL. Both
<!WA2><!WA2><A HREF="ftp://robios8.me.wisc.edu/pub/SL/irisSL.tar.gz">IRIX 5</A> and
<!WA3><!WA3><A HREF="ftp://robios8.me.wisc.edu/pub/SL/sunSL.tar.gz">SunOS 4.1.4</A>
versions are available. <P>

A compressed postsciprt version of the user's manual for the library
is also avaliable via anonymous ftp from robios8.me.wisc.edu in the
directory <!WA4><!WA4><a href="ftp://robios8.me.wisc.edu/pub/TechReports">
/pub/TechReports</a> as TR.RL-95002.ps.gz.
