	Gnats for Paradise
</title>

<h1>Gnats for Paradise
</h1>

This document tells you what you need to know to use
<!WA0><a href=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~curt/wgnats/gnats-man.html>gnats</a> for reporting  Paradise bugs.

<h3>Where it is</h3>

<p>
Gnats is installed in afs under /p/paradise/gnats.  That means
that everyone has access to the paradise gnats database where the
problem records are kept.
<p>
There are 3 things you can do with gnats: report problems, query the
problem database, and edit problems.  Gnats provides command line tools
for all of these things.

<h3>Reporting Problems</h3>

Problems are reported using the 
<!WA1><a href=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~curt/wgnats/send-pr.html>
send-pr program
</a>.  
If you run /p/paradise/gnats/bin/send-pr, you will find yourself in
the vi editor with a problem report template.  You can edit the 
template, and then do a "write-quit" to send the report to 
gnats.

<p>
<b>NOTE</b>:You can try out the system by reporting a problem within
the test category.

<h3>Querying the Problem Database</h3>
You can query the problem database using the 
<!WA2><a href=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~curt/wgnats/query-pr.html>query-pr program</a>.


<h3> Using WebGnats</h3>
<!WA3><a href=http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~curt/wgnats/webgnats.html>WebGnats</a> is a Web based interface to the gnats reporting and query
programs.  You can do most everything you need to, through
the
<!WA4><a href=http://happy.cs.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/wgnats/menu>WebGnats
interface</a>.

<p>
Problem reporting in web gnats is handled through an html form.  Each problem 
category can have its own form.  This allows different questions to be
posed for bug reports concerning different parts of the system.

<p>
In order to edit problems, you'll need to be running WebGnats from
a workstation with AFS access, and you'll need to have the following
in your .mailcap file.
<pre>

x-application/problem_edit; /p/paradise/gnats/bin/problem_edit %s

</pre>


<h3> Emacs </h3>
<p>
You can use gnats from within emacs by loading the gnats emacs 
interfaces. The files are located in /p/paradise/gnats/lib/emacs/lisp.
Look at the file gnats.el in that directory for configuration instructions.
