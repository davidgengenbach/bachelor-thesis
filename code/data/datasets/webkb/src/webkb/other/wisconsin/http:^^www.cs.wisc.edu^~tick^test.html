On the left is Oct 94, on the right is May 96. I may add a clean shaven/
goatee comparison, too, since I seem to let it grow for a week or two
and then shave it off, just to confuse people (and occasionally just shave
one side, although I haven't done that since Halloween ;) ). Speaking of
which jeff, at the bottom will soon feature something designed for me as a prank over
Spring Break a few years back...the culprits set that up as my start-up
screen and turned my monitor upside-down, but I'm not going to mention
names, Mika and Maura...Oopsie ;);)
