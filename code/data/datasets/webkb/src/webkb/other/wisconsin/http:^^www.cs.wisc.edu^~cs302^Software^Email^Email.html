<h1>Email</h1>

This information applies to the PC Eudora Email software in the 1370 lab. 
You access this through an icon labeled <strong>Email</strong> in the 
<strong>Networking</strong> folder.<p>
If you have problems with your Computer Science email, you should
contact your TA or the <!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><A
HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/csl/csl.html">Computer Systems Lab</A>.
Our email service provider is <em>not</em> the same as the campus
<em>WiscWorld</em> email service, so DoIT won't be able to help you
with any email problems.  You can, however, mail to any internet
address from the CS accounts, including WiscWorld and CAE accounts.

<h2><a name="email.starting">Starting the email application</a></h2><p>

In the "Networking" folder in the Program Manager, double-click on the
application labelled "email".<p>
Your initial "mail" password is the same as your initial network password.
Changing the network password, however, <em>does not</em>

<h2><a name="email.message.saving">Saving an email message</a></h2><p>

If you're using the email software in the 1370 lab, select from the 
<em>File</em> menu the item <em>Save As</em>. A dialog should appear.<p>

If you're saving the message to be an input file, uncheck the items
<em>Guess Paragraphs</em> and <em>Include Headers</em> if they're checked.<p>

Click on the <em>Drives</em> pop-up menu underneath the list of files to 
change the drive to U:, so that the file will be saved in your workspace.
If desired, change the U: directory by double-clicking on the directory
icons in the <em>Directories</em> list. (To move out of the current directory,
click on the topmost directory icon.)<p>

Finally, press the <em>Okay</em> button.

<h2><a name="email.sending.files">Sending files through email</a></h2><p>

	While in the course you may find it useful to email a C++ source file
or other files to your instructor.<p> 
	After you've started the Email application, create a 
<em>New Message</em>. Enter the intended recipient's address and
a subject.<p>
	Next, select from the <em>Message</em> menu the item 
<em>Attach Document</em>. In the dialog that appears, select the
document you wish to send.<p>
	Next, <strong>you must click off the Text->Doc button</strong> shown in the
icon bar. If you don't do this, your instructor will receive an unreadable
file.<p>
	Finally, you can press the <em>Send</em> button.<p>

<h2><a name="email.password.changing">Changing your email password</a></h2><p>
	In the "networking" folder, double-click on the "Change Password" icon.
You'll be asked for your name and password again. From here, you can
change your email password.<p>

Note, that if you put in the wrong password too many times, you will
be locked out of your account for a little while for security reasons.

<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The <em>Change Password</em> option in Eudora <STRONG>does
not</STRONG> work on our system.

<P>

<h2><a name="email.forwarding">Forwarding your mail</a></h2><p>
Unfortunately, the "Automatic Mail Forward" program does not yet
work.  If you want your email to be forwarded automatically, please
send email to <!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><A HREF="mailto:lab@cs.wisc.edu">lab@cs.wisc.edu</A> or
go to the 
<!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/csl/csl.html">Computer Systems Lab</A>
(on the second floor) during regular
business hours.
