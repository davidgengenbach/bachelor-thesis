<H1>Hints for Netscape</H1>

<P>Netscape is another World Wide Web browser like Mosaic.  There are
a few differences between Netscape and Mosaic, but very few should
have any impact on using the Web for this course.  

<P>Netscape is made by <!WA0><A HREF="http://home.mcom.com/">Netscape
Communications Corporation</A>.  For more information about their
software, check out their <!WA1><A

<P> You may find the <!WA2><A

feature of Netscape to be very useful to keep track of your
instructor's page, assignments, or anything else you might discover.
