<P><STRONG>11/8/96</STRONG> I checked out the columns problems. Many of the difficulties are associated with having the section break in the wrong place with respect to the paragraph marks. The other problem, the one involving the apparent lack of the creation of two columns, is a result of the next section starting on a NEW PAGE. Thus the two column section was in fact two columns. The problem was that there was so much space there was no need to go into the second column. In other words, the second column does not start until the first column is finished -- in the default case.
<P><STRONG>10/31/96</STRONG> A practice email was sent to all students. If you did not get the email, please send me an email; otherwise, you may miss important information.
<P><STRONG>10/20/96</STRONG> The Excel quiz is on Thursday. The exam building, Moore Hall, is located at 1575 Linden Drive, near Babcock. It is also the horticulture building.
