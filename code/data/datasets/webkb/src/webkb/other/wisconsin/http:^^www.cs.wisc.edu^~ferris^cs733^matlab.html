<H1>CS 733: Instructions to set up MATLAB</H1>

<H2> Introduction </H2>

Most of the assignments for this course will be carried out with the
aid of MATLAB, an interactive package for high performance scientific
computing.  To set up your ``sol'' account to use MATLAB, the
following should be carried out.

If logged in directly to a sol (e.g. sol10) then:

At the unix prompt, immediately after you login, carry out the following:
  
<PRE>
sol10> mkdir matlab
sol10> cp /u/c/s/cs733-1/public/startup.m  ~/matlab/startup.m
sol10> xterm -g 80x40 -e matlab &
</PRE>

The last command should set up a separate window from in which matlab
is running.  You can then use your favourite editor in the login
window to create any `m' files that you might need for your work.  All
the `m' files that are created by the instructor as well as the
homework and project data files in the public directory:

<PRE>
  /u/c/s/cs733-1/public  
</PRE>
  
are now available to you for use in MATLAB. 

For all homework assignments you should hand in your results produced 
as follows:
 
<PRE>
sol10> matlab
>> diary hwk1.lst
>> load hwk1 
>> .....whatever homework 1 requires 
>> diary off
>> exit
sol10> print hwk1.lst
</PRE>

<H2>Remote Unix Machine Users</H2>

Suppose that the machine you are logged on is not a sol, but is called
cheddar.  On a cheddar window you do the following:

<PRE>
cheddar> xhost +sol10
</PRE>


In the sol10 window on cheddar:

<PRE>
sol10> setenv DISPLAY cheddar:0
sol10> matlab
</PRE>
