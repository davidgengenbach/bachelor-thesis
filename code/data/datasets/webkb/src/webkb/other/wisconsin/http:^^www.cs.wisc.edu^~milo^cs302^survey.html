<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Class Survey</H1>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Due Monday, September 9, 1996</H3>
<hr><br>

This assignment is to make sure that you are familiar with email and also 
to let me know a little bit more about you. <p>

I would like you to attach a picture of yourself to a 8.5" x 11" sheet of
paper, label it clearly with your name and turn it in.  It should be a
picture that is recent enough so that the picture looks similar to what
you do now.  (I warned you about this on Wednesday, so no excuses.)<p>

I am terrible with names.  However, I hope that with the pictures to assist 
me in learning your names, I will quickly know you all by name. <p>

In addition, send me an email at <EM>milo@cs.wisc.edu</EM> with brief 
answers to the following questions about yourself:

<UL>
  <LI>  Name
  <LI>  E-mail address
  <LI>  Year in school (Senior, Junior, etc)
  <LI>  Planned major, if you have not chosen a major yet, that's fine.
  <LI>  Past computer and computer programming experience.
  <LI>  Motivation for taking this class.  What do you want to get out of 
this class?
  <LI>  One really interesting and unique thing about you that will help 
be remember you.  The stranger the better.

</UL>
This would also be a good time to express any concerns about the items 
covered under "Other Educational Concerns" on the general information sheet.
