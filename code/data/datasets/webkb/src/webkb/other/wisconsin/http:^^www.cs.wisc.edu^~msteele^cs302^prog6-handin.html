Program 6 Handin Dates
</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
 
I'm extending the deadline for program 6 only.  

<H3>Reasons:</H3>
<UL>
   <LI>  To be fair to people since I just made that last minute 
      correction and clarifications in e-mail
   <LI>  Because this project is taking people longer than I expected
      and most other TA's gave their classes a week and a half to
      do it instead of a week
   <LI>  Because it's midterm time, half of you are probably going to
      hand it in late anyway, and I'm feeling generous
</UL>

<H3>The new policy for THIS PROGRAM ONLY is:</H3>
<UL>
   <LI>  You may hand it in by 5pm Friday for 2 bonus points.
   <LI>  You may hand it in by the end of my office hours on Monday, 
      November 11 (2:30pm), for full credit.
   <LI>  You may hand it in by the beginning of class on Tuesday for
      the regular 25% reduction and by Thursday for the regular 50%
      reduction.
</UL>

<H3>So what's the catch?</H3>
<UL>
   <LI>  If you hand it in after Friday, you should not expect to get it 
      graded and returned before the exam
   <LI>  Remember that the exam on Tuesday counts 20% of your grade, whereas
      this program only counts approximately 4%.  Do the math and budget
      your time this weekend accordingly.
   <LI>  I'm going to be extraordinarily strict about deadlines this time.
      If you hand it in at 5:05pm on Friday, no bonus points.  If you
      slide it under my door at 2:35pm on Monday, it's late.
</UL>
