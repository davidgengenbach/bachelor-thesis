<em>Please</em> read the following before checking out your grades.<p>
<li> <b>Please do not send me e-mail about your grades posted here!</b>  Bring
the paper in question to class or office hours.<p>
<li> The last 4 digits of your student id number head the row containing
your grades.<p>
<li> This output from the grading program is updated infrequently; changes
made to your grade will not appear automatically.  I will attempt to update
this every other week or so.<p>
<li> I am unable to "guestimate" your final grade based on the scores on
this page.  There are many factors to consider when assigning final letter
grades.  However, your point average is the main factor in this decision.
Based on the fact that the median letter grade will be a BC, you should be
able to guess as well as I could.<p>
<li> Roughly 33% of your grade has been computed thus far.  Do not panic!<p>
