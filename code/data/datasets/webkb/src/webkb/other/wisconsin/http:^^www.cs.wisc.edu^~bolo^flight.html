<h1>Slipping the Surly Bonds of Earth</h1>

Bolo's a certified (or is that certifiable) airplane pilot!

<p>I currently hold a Commercial Pilot's License with
Instrument and Single Engine Land ratings.
I was planning on working on a Flight Instructors certificate
this year, but moving into and taking care of
<!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bolo/house.html">my new house</a>
has started consuming free time.

<P>Normally I fly a <em>Piper Cherokee</em>, either an
<em>Arrow</em> or an <em>Archer</em>.
I have been known to pilot a <em>Cessna</em> on occasion.

<p>The <em>Grumman Tiger</em> has always fascinated me.
I'd like to either spend some time flying one, and perhaps
get a "checkout" in it.
If you know of any for rent in the vicinity of Madison, WI, USA,
please <!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><a href="mailto:bolo@cs.wisc.edu">tell me</a>!

<p>Several years ago, I used to own part of an airplane,
a <em>Piper Cherokee 140</em>.
We spent a lot of time, and 2.5 ratings, together before I
had to sell that wonderful plane.
If you see <em>N5755U</em>, say "hi" for me!

<p>If you were wondering about the title of this page, it's
a reference to a memorable poem, 
<!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~bolo/poetry/high_flight.html">High Flight</a>,
by John C. Magee.
