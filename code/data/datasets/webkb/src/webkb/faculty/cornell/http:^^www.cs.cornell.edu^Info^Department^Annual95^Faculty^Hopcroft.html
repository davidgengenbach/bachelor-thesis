<h2>
John E. Hopcroft<br>
Joseph Silbert Dean of Engineering<br>
Professor of Computer Science<br>
PhD Stanford University, 1964

<p>

On January 1, 1994, I was appointed dean of the College of Engineering and 
now oversee the ten academic departments that comprise the college as well 
as various research units.  My involvement with the Computer Science 
Department continues through research on robust geometric algorithms, 
modeling and simulation, and information capture and access.
<p>
In collaboration with the Design Research Institute, we are developing 
technologies to facilitate information capture and access within an 
engineering design environment.  Among the technologies being researched 
are distributed databases and persistent object storage, document image 
processing and management, multimedia and user interface technology, 
information science for heterogeneous data, knowledge representation and 
organization, and remote collaboration technologies.
