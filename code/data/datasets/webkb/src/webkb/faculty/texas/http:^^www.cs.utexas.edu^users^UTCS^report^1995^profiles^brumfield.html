<h2>Summary of Research</h2>

I am interested in the role models play in computer science. Designers
of computing systems use mathematical models to study the performance
of existing and proposed systems. In a queueing network model, each
resource in the computer system is represented by a queue of tasks
awaiting service. The solution of the model involves the computation
of response times, queue lengths, and throughputs. <p>
