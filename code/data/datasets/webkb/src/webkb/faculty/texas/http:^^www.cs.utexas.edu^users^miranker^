<h1> Welcome to</h1>
<h1> Daniel Miranker's </h1>
<h1> Belated Web Presence </h1>

(under construction, see something you'd like finished, don't hold your breath,
just send me a note, miranker@cs.utexas.edu, I'll get it to you the old fashion
way.  My students pages wouldn't be a bad place to go either.}


<h2> On Rule Matching   </h2>

If you are here to learn more about the TREAT algorithm and its
comparison to RETE, be warned that both have been rendered obsolete by
the <!WA0><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/miranker/leaps-refs.bib"> LEAPS </a> algorithm.

<h2> Current Research Interests </h2>

My current research goals encompass the Venus rule language, its use
as the basis of Active, Distributed Databases and the fundamental
computer science problems and corollaries that have evolved from that
goal.

<li> (CSP) Constraint Satisfaction Search

<li> Query Optimization, both relational and <!WA1><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/miranker/ooq.ps">
object-oriented.</a>

<li> Parallel Execution of Rule-Based programs

<li> Knowledge Compilation
