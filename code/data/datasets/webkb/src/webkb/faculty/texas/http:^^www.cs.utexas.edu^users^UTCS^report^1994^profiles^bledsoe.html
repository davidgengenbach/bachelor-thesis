Automatic theorem proving and artificial intelligence <p>


<h2>Summary of Research</h2>


My research focuses on automated theorem proving and automatic theorem
proof checking. This involves the use of heuristics and higher level
plans, as well as the use of examples and of analogy. I am also
interested in research on analogy and learning in artificial
intelligence. <p>
