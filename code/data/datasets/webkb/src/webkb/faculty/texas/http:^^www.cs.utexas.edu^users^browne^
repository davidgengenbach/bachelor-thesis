<h2>Honors and Awards</h2>

<ul>
<li> Fellow, British Computer Society
<li> Fellow, American Physical Society
</ul>


<h2>Areas of Interest</h2>

Parallel computation with the major focus on parallel programming,
high level specification languages and integration of computer science
with application areas <p>


<h2>Summary of Research</h2>

I have been working on parallel programming for more than ten
years. The Computationally Oriented Display Environment (<!WA3><!WA3><A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/code">CODE</A>), an
abstract declarative graphical environment for parallel programming,
has evolved through three generations. Ongoing research includes
methods for optimization of parallel computation structures at high
levels of abstraction, integration of parallel structuring through
data partitioning into the generalized data flow model of CODE,
debugging in the graphical/visual environment, compositional
approaches to parallel programming and the addition of intelligence
process control to parallel programs in computational fluid
dynamics. I am also working on design and development of narrow domain
compilable high level specification languages including logic-based
languages and robust methods for programming intelligent real-time
decision systems. <p>
