<h2>Areas of Interest</h2>

Interconnection networks and parallel processing in computer architecture <p>


<h2>Summary of Research</h2>

My research in computer architecture focuses on <i>interconnection
networks.</i>  The success or failure of parallel computing systems rests
in the ability to devise appropriate cost/performance interconnection
structures. The most recent work on interconnections involves the
development of a wafer scale optical interconnection. A special kind
of laser and wave guide has been designed and is being
investigated. This technique leads to very fault-tolerant parallel
systems on the wafer. This same optical interconnection is being
applied to optical systems busses and optical communication
switches. Work on the performance of processor systems is
continuing. A methodology for measuring processor performance
portability across machines has been developed. In contrast to
benchmarking, it represents true measurement of a processor/memory
system. <p>
