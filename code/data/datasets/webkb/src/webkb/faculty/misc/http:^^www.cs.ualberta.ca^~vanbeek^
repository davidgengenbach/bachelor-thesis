<H2>Biographical sketch</H2>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
    I received my PhD in 1990 from the University of Waterloo and
    at that time joined the faculty at the University of Alberta
    where I am now an Associate Professor.
    I am a participant as a principal investigator in projects on
    intelligent scheduling and on speech understanding under the
    Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems (IRIS II).
    I have served on the program committees of several international
    conferences and workshops.
    In 1992, a paper I wrote was awarded honorable mention in
    the best written paper competition at the National Conference of
    the American Association for Artificial Intelligence.
    In 1995, a paper I co-authored won an Outstanding Paper
    Award at the International Joint Conference on Artificial
    Intelligence.
