<P>

My origins, like those of most people born in North America during this
century, are ambiguous and questionable.  I'm currently a research faculty
member in the 
<!WA0><A HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/index.html"> U.C. San Diego CS&E Department
</A>
where I research CS and a little E (every now and then) in a decidedly
pedagogical manner.  My current interests include
<!WA1><A HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/groups/hpcl/het.html">
heterogeneous computing</A> for performance as well as research in
parallel and distributed systems.  Consequently, I'm housed quite comfortably
in the 
<!WA2><A HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/groups/hpcl/hpcl.html">
High Performance and Scientific Computing lab.</A>
 
<P>
My vita
and some of my more recent
<!WA3><A HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/rich/publications.html">
publication efforts</A> are here as are a bunch of
<!WA4><A HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/jenny/work.html"> related pointers</A> to other Web locales.
Of course, research is not possible without readily accessible
<!WA5><A HREF="http://mls.saic.com/mls.coffee.html"> coffee </A>
and
<!WA6><A HREF="http://underground.net/Sdrocks/concerts.html"> music </A>
which luckly are available here in the San Diego area.  Occasionally,
a
<!WA7><A HREF = "http://www.thegroup.net/kidder/movies.htm#East"> movie </A>
is also necessary.
