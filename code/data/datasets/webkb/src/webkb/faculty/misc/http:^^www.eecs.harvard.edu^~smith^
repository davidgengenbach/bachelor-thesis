<h3>ARCHITECTURES AND COMPILATION TECHNIQUES FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTER
SYSTEMS</h3>

Individual advances in hardware and software technology continue to
spawn advances in the capability and performance of computer systems.
As impressive as these advances are, even better systems are often
possible if one redesigns the architectural interface that couples the
hardware and software.  Professor Smith's research focuses on the
experimental realization of these innovative compilers and computer
architectures.
<p>
Professor Smith's work consists of the design, implementation, and
evaluation of novel architectural mechanisms for high-performance
computer systems through the innovative combination of VLSI, compiler,
operating system, and network technologies.  For the last few years,
Professor Smith has worked on superscalar architectures, global
instruction scheduling algorithms, and compile-time transformations to
improve branch prediction and instruction fetching.  Presently, his
research team is exploring sophisticated compiler algorithms and novel
computer architectures that address the performance needs of
multimedia and system-intensive applications.
