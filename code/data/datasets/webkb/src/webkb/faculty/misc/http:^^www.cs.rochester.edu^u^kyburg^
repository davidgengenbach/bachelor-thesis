Both we and our machines must be able to take account of uncertainty,
for reasoning, for planning, in knowledge representation. Dealing
with uncertainty raises a number of fundamental questions:
<P>
How do you best represent uncertainty in a formal framework? Various
suggestions have been made; it is turning out to be the case that most
are reducible to probabilistic measures.  Is probability objective or
subjective? Purely subjective views of probability are of questionable
use; but objective logical views are not yet well developed. That is a
task we are currently working on.
<P>
Not only do we want to represent uncertainty in a fixed body of
knowledge, but we want to use new evidence to update those
probabilities. Various updating procedures have been proposed.
Analysis reveals that they have much in common, but efficient updating
is still a goal we are working on.
<P>
Finally, the reason for the intelligent use of uncertainty is for
making decisions. But the appropriate decision theory depends on the
treatment of uncertainty, and so is also an active area of research.
