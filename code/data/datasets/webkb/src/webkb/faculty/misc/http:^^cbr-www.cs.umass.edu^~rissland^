Edwina L. Rissland received her Sc.B. in Applied Mathematics with Honors magna
cum laude from Brown University, M.A. in Mathematics from Brandeis University,
and the Ph.D. in Mathematics from MIT in 1977. She has been on the faculty of
the Department of Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst
since 1979. She currently holds the rank of Professor. Recognized as a founder
and world leader in the areas of Case-Based Reasoning and AI and Law, she was
elected as a Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence
(AAAI) in 1991.
<p>
After receiving her doctorate, she remained at MIT as an Instructor and Research
Associate in the Mathematics Department for two years. In September 1979, she
joined the Department of Computer Science at UMass. For the 1982-83 academic
year, she was a Fellow of Law and Computer Science at the Harvard Law School.
Since 1985, she has held an appointment as Lecturer on Law at the Harvard Law
School, where she teaches a seminar on Artificial Intelligence and Legal
Reasoning during the Fall semester. 
<p>
Her current areas of research include case-based reasoning, AI and legal
reasoning, knowledge acquisition and machine learning, and CBR and intelligent
information retrieval.
<p>
Professor Rissland is Liaison on Law and AI for the AAAI (American Association
for Artificial Intelligence). She is currently Vice President of the
International Association for Artificial Intelligence and Law. She has served on
numerous program committees, including the annual national conference of the
AAAI, and every one of the biennial international conferences on AI and Law,
which began in 1987. She was Co-Editor of the MIT Press series on AI and Law and
is a founding member of the editorial board of the journal Artificial
Intelligence and Law. She is a co-author of the text Cognitive Science: An
Integrated Approach published by MIT Press/Bradford Books, and about to be
issued in its Second Edition.
<p>
Professor Rissland has lectured widely on AI, AI and Law, and Case-based
Reasoning. Currently she is principal investigator for several research projects
on case-based reasoning; grant support for these projects includes DARPA and the
NSF, as well as private industry. She has been an author on over fifty articles
and books and regularly publishes in the yearly AI conferences, such as AAAI and
IJCAI. She frequently consults with industry and government on these topics.
