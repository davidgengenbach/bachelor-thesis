I'm an associate professor and do <!WA6><A HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/marzullo/bibliography.html">
research</A> in fault-tolerant distributed systems. My most recent
interests are in the foundations of group-based programming and its
application to distributed computing architectures different than 
a collection of asynchronous workstations running on local area networks
of workstations. 

I'm affiliated with the following research projects:
<UL>
<LI> <!WA7><A HREF="http://www.nile.utexas.edu/NC/"> The Nile Project</A>
that has to do with distributed computing for high-energy
physicists. Our goal is to provide a deep hierarchical storage system
and a distributed runtime environment for very long-running jobs. My
main focus on this project is the distributed application management
issues: I'd like to be able to have the system adapt to changes in
resources, communication platforms, internet connections and internet
charges without having to rewrite the system or the applications
running on the system.<br><br>

<LI> <!WA8><A HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/marzullo/team.html"> The Team Project</A> that is building
distributed computing platforms for both hard and soft-real-time
systems. My main focus has been on providing the runtime environment
to make fault-tolerant hard real-time computing available to
inexpensive platforms.
</UL>

Some things that I'm working on with students and ex-students:
<UL> 
<LI> The message logging approach to making services tolerate crash
and communication failures, with <!WA9><A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/lorenzo/">
Lorenzo Alvisi</A>. We've come up with a simple and expressive way to
characterize the approach and have derived practical and optimal
protocols for both message passing and distributed shared memory
architectures. A paper describing the approach can be found 
<!WA10><A HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/marzullo/dcsfinal.ps"> here</A>
and a paper giving a set of protocols (with a comparison to Manetho)
can be found <!WA11><A HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/marzullo/ftcs.ps">here</A>.<br><br>
<LI> Group programming in a hard real-time environment, with <!WA12><A
HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/marzullo//users/mclegg/"> Matthew Clegg</A>.
We've combined some of the schedulability work done for uniprocessors
with the process group abstraction for distributed systems to come up
with a system that can tolerate timing, crash and communication
failures while still meeting hard real-time deadlines.<br><br>
One of the problems in such systems, of course, is clock
synchronization. A paper that describes how we do this can be found
<!WA13><A HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/marzullo/clocks.ps"> here</A><br><br>.
<LI> Failure models, with <!WA14><A
HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/sabel/sabel.html">
Laura Sabel</A>. We've taken apart some of the group membership
protocols to better understand what are the lower bounds are for
several of the properties that are commonly provided. One way to think
of this work is that we're looking at failure detectors that are 
<em>stronger</em> than a Perfect Failure Detector and at
<em>approximations</em> of such failure detectors that are
implementable.
<br><br>
If you're interested in failure detectors in general, you might take
a look at <!WA15><A
HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/chandra/FailureDetectionPapers.html">
a WWW page</A> that compiles papers on the topic.<br><br>
<LI> Comparison of fault-tolerance techniques,with <!WA16><A
HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/marzullo//users/jsussman/"> Jeremy Sussman</A>.
The goal here is to understand what are the intrinsic benefits of a
given fault-tolerance paradigm, such as the primary-backup approach,
coordinatory-cohort, or active replication.
