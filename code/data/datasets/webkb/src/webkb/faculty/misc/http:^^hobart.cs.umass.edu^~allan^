<p>I am a research assistant professor working with the <!WA5><a
href="http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/">Center for Intelligent Information
Retrieval</a> (CIIR).  My current work focuses on these areas:
<ul>
  <li> tools for browsing collections of documents

  <li> relevance feedback techniques

  <li> combining structural information about documents with textual
  information in order to improve quality of retrieval.  This is joint
  work with <!WA6><a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~rus/">Daniela
  Rus</a> at the <!WA7><a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth
  College's Department of Computer Science</a>.
</ul>
A list of my papers, including on-line copies of many of them, is
available <!WA8><a href="http://hobart.cs.umass.edu/~allan/Papers/list.html">here</a>.


<p> I got the Ph.D. in January, 1995, from <!WA9><a
href="http://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>'s <!WA10><a
href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Computer Science Department</a>.  My
advisor was the late <!WA11><a
href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Faculty/Gerard_Salton.html">Gerard
Salton</a> (1927-1995).  My thesis was on the automatic construction
of hypertext links.

<p> I am guest co-editor of a special topic issue of <em>Information
Processing and Management</em> on the tools for the automatic
construction of hypertext and hypermedia.  For more details, see the
<!WA12><a href="http://hobart.cs.umass.edu/~allan/ipm-call.html">call for papers</a>.

<p>
On an on-going basis, I am running a research group meeting called
<!WA13><A HREF="http://hobart.cs.umass.edu/~allan/irtopics.html">Topics in Information Retrieval</A>.  It is
also a seminar which students can take.

<hr>
In the old days, I played <!WA14><a
href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Activities/hockey/hockey.html">ice
hockey with Cornell's CS department</a>.

<p> At Cornell, I worked with the Smart system Information Retrieval
group.  I also participated in discussions with the <!WA15><a
href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/icap.html">Information
Capture and Access research group</a>.
