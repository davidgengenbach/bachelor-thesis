<H2>Research Interests</H2> <P><I><!WA6><a
href="http://dis.cs.umass.edu/research/negotiation.html">Negotiation
among computationally bounded self-interested agents</a>, multiagent
systems, distributed problem solving, distributed artificial
intelligence, negotiation, coalition formation, electronic commerce,
resource-bounded reasoning, normative methods for system design,
machine learning, combinatorial optimization, scheduling.  </I>

<P>My primary interests lie in inherently distributed combinatorial
problems - resource and task allocation and scheduling among agents
with different levels of autonomy, e.g. representing different real
world enterprises that are seeking synergies by limited
cooperation. Such settings occur for example in production scheduling
in multi-enterprise agile manufacturing, in negotiations with
real-world subcontractors, in vehicle routing among dispatch centers
of different companies, in meeting scheduling, in classroom scheduling
etc. I am studying different commitment strategies and protocols in
multiagent systems, and the possibility of carrying out contracts
without external enforcement. I have studied the role of marginal
costs as a basis for negotiation and questions of bounded rationality
and deliberation scheduling when the exact computation of marginal
costs is intractable. I have also analyzed the effect of asynchrony
and message congestion among negotiators and greater domain risk
tolerance to enhance the negotiation process computationally. I am
currently studying the usefulness of distributed versions of a variety
of combinatorial optimization algorithms from the AI and OR
communities. Some other research issues that I am currently addressing
are: using machine learning techniques to alternate between different
negotiation strategies based on dynamic properties of the environment,
cost-based constraint relaxation, anticipation of future contracts in
an agent's negotiation strategy, fair on-line profit division schemes
among agents, and contracts involving multiple agents as opposed to
just two. Lately, I have also developed a normative theory of
coalitions among bounded rational agents.

<P>My secondary interest is machine learning. On the theoretical side,
I lately coauthored a paper that disproved a justification for biasing
decision tree induction algorithms towards generating trees with few
leaves. I have also coauthored an empirical paper that studied the
applicability of Q-learning to multiagent settings. On the applied
side I am currently - in cooperation with domain experts who actually
need the solution - comparing a number of symbolic induction methods
and neural network algorithms to enhance classification accuracy in a
real-world biological problem. Specifically, we use the methods to
predict morbidity and mortality in equine colic.

<H2>Work Experience</H2>

<P><B>Research Assistant</B> for Prof. Victor Lesser, Fall 1992 -
present. University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Department of
Computer Science. Developed a normative theory of coalitions among
self-interested agents whose rationality is bounded by computational
complexity. Extended the contract net framework towards working among
self-interested agents whose rationality is limited by computational
complexity. Explored the advantages of different modes of commitment
and the use of marginal costs in negotiation among intelligent
agents. Invented a method that enables autonomous computational agents
to carry out exchanges without enforcement. Participated in the design
and development of a distributed scheduling system for airport ground
resource management. Discovered new structure in an abstract decision
problem (3SAT). Developed a method for calculating the value of
probabilistic information and a way to use this value for optimal
termination of anytime algorithms by conditioning the algorithm's
perfomance profile on execution so far.

<P><B>Research Scientist</B>, Fall 1990 - Summer 1992. Technical Research
Centre of Finland, Laboratory for Information Processing. Designed and
developed a prototype system for distributed optimization of vehicle
routes among autonomous dispatch centers. Studied issues of
commitment, asynchrony, message congestion, and risk attitude in this
domain using data from real dispatch centers. Built a train transport
optimization application for a large forestry company. Participated in
the development of a large scale forestry transport optimization
application involving multiple modes of transport and different time
scales.

<P><B>Researcher/Systems Analyst</B>, Spring 1990 - Fall 1990. Nokia
Research Center, Knowledge Engineering Department. Participated in the
development of an XIPlus-based expert system in the domain of
retirement and pension law. In parallel, participated in developing
and testing a compiler for transforming XIPlus rules into C-code.

<P><B>Systems Developer</B>, Fall 1988 - Spring 1990. Kielikone
Corporation. Converted the <I>Morfo</I> Finnish proofreading program
for use with different word processing programs and different
execution platforms.

<P><B>Database developer</B>, Summer 1989. Smart and Final Iris, Co.,
Los Angeles, California. Participated in the development of a customer
database.
