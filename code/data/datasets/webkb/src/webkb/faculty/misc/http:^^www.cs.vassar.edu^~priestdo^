	<p>The Archery Mini-Course <em>Split The Wand!</em> is back.
	If you need information about it send me mail.  If you want to
	shoot on campus and are not on my e-mail info list, please
	send me a note and I will add you to it.  You will then be
	informed of where and when we are shooting and be kept abreast
	of any last minute changes.</p>

        <p>There are also local (off campus) archery practices.  For
        information on these, send me a note and I will put you in
        touch with the person running them.</p>

	<p>We have been shooting on campus again since 1991.  I would
        be interested in any stories or information on Archery at
        Vassar back when it was a team sport.</p>

Standard.</a> </dt>

      <dd><p>March 1996.  From the abstract "The CES has
been designed to be optimally suited for use in language engineering
research and applications, in order to serve as a widely accepted set
of encoding standards for European corpus work...The CES specifies a
minimal encoding level that corpora must achieve to be considered
standardized in terms of descriptive representation (marking of
structural and typographic information) as well as general
architecture (so as to be maximally suited for use in a text
database).  It also provides encoding specifications for linguistic
annotation, together with a data architecture for linguistic corpora."</p><p></p></dd>

      <dt>tagusage</dt>
      <dd><p>This short shell script writen by Heiki-Jaan Kaalep and
then modified by me will do the tag usage
calculations for you and and format it in so you can just paste it into
your TEI or CES header (or any other DTD that wants tagusage).  It
is dependent on the unix carriage return so it will probably need
to be modified to work under dos. <!WA18><a

<dt>Using Cyrillic Entities with Emacs psgml mode</dt>
<dd><p>I have a system that lets you type the keys you would normally
type to generate a character but when you are in psgml mode it
generates the entitiy for this character, so you can type normaly and
be inserting entities.  It would work equally well for other character
sets (ISOlat1 or 2), I just had a need for cyrillic so that is the one I set up.</p>
<p>If you want to find out more you can read the <!WA19><a
href=http://www.cs.vassar.edu/~priestdo/cyrillic.entities.howto>HowTo file.  </a>I am looking some for people to
try this out and give me feedback before I put it up for public
consumption.  So if after looking at the HowTo you want the package,
please send me email and we'll work out a way to get it to you
(uuencoded mail probably).</p><p></p>
