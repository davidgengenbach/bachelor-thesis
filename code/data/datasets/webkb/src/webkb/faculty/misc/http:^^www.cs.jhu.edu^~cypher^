<dt><strong>Research:</strong>
<p>
<dd>Communication and synchronization in parallel and distributed computers including 
<dd>communication protocols, synchronization protocols, routing algorithms, fault-tolerant 
<dd>interconnection networks, and techniques for creating portable parallel applications.

<p>

<dt><strong>Current Projects:</strong>
<p>
<dd><strong>Portable and Repeatable Parallel Applications:</strong>
<dd>The goal of this project is the creation of software 
that will help application developers 
<dd>write correct message-passing code.  The software will 
take a trace of the communication 
<dd>events in an MPI (Message Passing Interface) application 
and determine if the application 
<dd>will always yield the same results given the same inputs.  
The software will use a novel 
<dd>type of vector clock in order to detect race conditions.
<p>
<dd><strong>Fault-Tolerant Communication Networks:</strong>
<dd>This project studies how communication networks can be 
designed to tolerate a small 
<dd>number of faults.  There are two main goals: 1) the 
design of networks that can support 
<dd>pipeline (1-D) computations efficiently in the presence 
of faults, and 2) the creation of 
<dd>techniques that prevent deadlock despite faulty switches or wires.
