have a home page, so here goes.  With a little effort, this might work itself into reasonable

Actually, I do have a <!WA1><a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~patt/cyprus.gif"> more nearly current</a> picture, 
which was taken in a museum in Cyprus in June, 1995 by Greg Egan, professor at
Monash University.

Once I get things straightened out, there will be links to:
<ul>
<li> <!WA2><a href="http://www.engin.umich.edu/class/eecs100/">EECS 100</a>, a serious Introduction 
to Computer Science and Computer Engineering for
Undergraduate majors in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering.
<li> <!WA3><a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/HPS/">HPS</a>: My research group.
<li> Our industrial affiliates program in the Computer Science Division at Michigan IPoCSE.
<li> a reasonably current cv, in ascii, suitable for reading.  Postscript is available for the asking.
<li> My views on Education.
<li> My views on Computer Architecture.
<li> Other recent drivel that I have generated and feel compelled to share with you.
</ul>
