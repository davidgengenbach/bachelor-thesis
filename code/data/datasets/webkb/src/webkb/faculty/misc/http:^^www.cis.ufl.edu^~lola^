I'm a faculty member with the University of Florida's
<!WA2><a href="http://www.cis.ufl.edu/">Computer
and Information Sciences Department</a>.<p>

<ul>
     <li> Email address: <i>lola@cis.ufl.edu</i>
     <li> Office: E506 CSE
     <li> Phone: 904/392-9684<p>
</ul>
Every semester I teach two introduction to COBOL classes
and one section of <!WA3><a
href="http://grove.circa.ufl.edu/~u3063bnk/"> Computers in
Modern Society </a>.  <p>

Besides teaching in CIS, I write <!WA4><a
href="http://www.cis.ufl.edu/~lola/poems">poetry </a>.  I've
published five books of poems, as well as an introductory
prose poem to a coffee table book of photographs of Florida:

<ol>

<li><em> Planting the Children</em>, University Press 
of Florida, 1983. 
<li><em> Castings</em>, Countryman Press, 1984, second edition
Betony Press, 1992.
<li><em> Across Her Broad Lap Something Wonderful</em>, State
Street Press, 1990 (out of print)
<li><em>Forty-Four Ambitions for the Piano</em>, University Press
of Florida, 1990, second edition Betony Press, 1992.
<li><em>Hunger</em>, University of Iowa Press, 1993 (Winner of
the Iowa Poetry Prize).
<li><em>Visions of Florida</em>, with photographs by Woody
Walters, University Press of Florida, 1994.

</ol><p>

There's a sixth book of poems, <em>Extranjera</em> forthcoming
from Story Line Press, and I'm working on a book of essays and a
children's story.  Besides writing, I most love to do poetry
readings, and have read (recited; I perform from memory) at many
universities and writing centers around the country.  Usually
when I read, I also teach a writing workshop.  My one peer
contact every year is attending the Associated Writing Programs
annual conference, a wonderful way to see friends and learn about
new writing.
