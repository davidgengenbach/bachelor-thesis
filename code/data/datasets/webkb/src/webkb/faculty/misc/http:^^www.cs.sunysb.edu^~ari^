<H2>Short Biography</H2>
Arie E. Kaufman is a Leading Professor of
<!WA7><a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/">Computer Science</a>
and Radiology at the
<!WA8><a href="http://www.sunysb.edu/">State University of New York
at Stony Brook,</a>
where he
is the director of the Cube project for volume visualization supported
by the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Hughes
Aircraft Company, Hewlett-Packard Company, Silicon Graphics Company,
Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Center for Biotechnology, and the
State of New York.  His research interests include volume
visualization; computer graphics architectures, algorithms, and
languages; user interfaces; scientific visualization; and multimedia.
Kaufman is the Editor-in-Chief of the new
<!WA9><a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~tvcg">
IEEE Transaction on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)</a>.
He has lectured widely and published numerous
<!WA10><a href="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~vislab/list_papers.html">
technical papers </a>
in these areas, including the IEEE
tutorial book on Volume Visualization.  He has given several courses
on Volume Visualization for SIGGRAPH, Visualization, VBC, CGI,
EUROGRAPHICS, GI, and IBM.  He has been the Papers Chair and Program
co-Chair for Visualization '90-'94 and co-Chair for several
EUROGRAPHICS Graphics Hardware Workshops, and the chairman of the IEEE
CS Technical Committee on Computer Graphics.  He received a BS in
Mathematics and Physics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in
1969, an MS in Computer Science from the Weizmann Institute of
Science, Rehovot, in 1973 and a PhD in Computer Science from the
Ben-Gurion University, Israel, in 1977.
