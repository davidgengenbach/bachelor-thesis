<h2> Areas of Interest </h2>
Neural networks, stochastic function optimization,
parallel pattern recognition systems,
scientific and biomedical computing, time series analysis,
numerical and combinatorial
optimization problems, and human computer interaction.<p>

<h2> Summary of Research</h2>

My research examines using advanced, parallel simulated annealing
and genetic algorithms methods in multivariate function approximation
and combinatorial optimization tasks. My research also involves
using neural network methods for pattern recognition and analysis,
including time series analysis.

In the 
<!WA1><A NAME=derm HREF="http://www.cs.utsa.edu/research/biomedcomp.html">
<B> Biomedical Computing Laboratory</B></A>
I am working on two
research projects:
1) Computer Aided Fetal Heart Rate Analysis and
2) Computer Aided Dermatological anaylsis of Pigmented Skin Lesions.
Both projects involve using artificial neural networks for
biomedical pattern recognition.
