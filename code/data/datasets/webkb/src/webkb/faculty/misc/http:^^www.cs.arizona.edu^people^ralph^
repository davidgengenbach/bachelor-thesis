<BR>
<HR>Ralph E. Griswold holds a B.S. degree in physics and M.S and Ph.D. degrees
in electrical engineering, all from Stanford University.<BR>
<BR>
He became a member of the Programming Research Department at Bell Laboratories
in 1962, where he started research on symbolic computation and the design
and implementation of high-level programming languages for non-numeric computation.
This work led to the development of the first SNOBOL language. Subsequent
work led to the SNOBOL4 programming langauge, which is still in use today.<BR>
<BR>
In 1967, he was appointed head of the Programming Research and Development
Department at Bell Labs, where he continued his research and also supervised
groups involved in a wide range of computer science research.<BR>
<BR>
In 1971, he joined the faculty of The University of Arizona as the first
Professor of Computer Science. He developed the newly formed department
where he was department head until 1981. In 1990 he was appointed Regents'
Professor of Computer Science.<BR>
<BR>
While at The University of Arizona, he continued his work on programming
language design and implementation, which led to the programming languages
SL5 and <!WA1><A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/index.html">Icon </A>. More recently, he has
worked on program visualization and graphics programming.<BR>
<BR>
In 1995, he retired to have more time for his research, programming, and
graphics interests.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Griswold is the author or co-author of six books on programming languages,
the implementation of programming languages, and programming methodology.
He presently is co-authoring a book on <!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/gb.html">graphics
