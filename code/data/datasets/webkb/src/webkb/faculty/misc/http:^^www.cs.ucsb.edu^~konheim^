Dr. Konheim received the B.E.E. and M.S. (Mathematics) from the Polytechnic 
Institute of Brooklyn in 1955 and 1957, respectively.  He was awarded the 
Ph.D. (Mathematics) from Cornell University in 1960.
<p>
While a Research Staff Member in the Mathematical Sciences Department at 
the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights (1960-82), 
he was a visiting Fellow in Mathematics at the California Institute of 
Technology (1962) and a Senior Fulbright Scholar at the Institute for 
Pure and Applied Mathematics at the University of Heidelberg (1966).
<p>
Dr. Konheim's professional interests span several areas in Computer Science.
His early work at IBM was related to the application of neural-like networks 
(Perceptrons) to pattern-recognition problems.  The analysis of computer 
algorithms evaluated methods for improving the efficiency
of storage schema (hashing, padded lists, sparse tables and disk access).
<p>
IBM's Liberty Banking Systems included a cryptographic function based 
on the LUCIFER algorithm developed by his group at the Yorktown Research 
Center.  This work led to the Data Encryption Standard which was evaluated 
by his Yorktown Probability and Cryptography Group and certified as a 
National Standard in the 1970's.  Dr. Konheim has spent several summers 
working for the government in the area of cryptanalysis.
<p>
In 1970, he began to study the performance of computer communication 
systems while on sabbatical at the IBM Zurich Laboratory.  In connection 
with the design of IBM's digital PBX, mathematical techniques for 
modeling loop systems and multiplexing by polling were developed. 
<p>
His current research interests include<br>
<p> 
<li><em>(i)</em> the effect of interference 
of virtual circuits in window-based flow control, 
<p>
<li><em>(ii)</em> the performance of packet-radio networks,
<p>
<li><em>(iii)</em> input rate control for B-ISDN,
<p> 
<li><em>(iv)</em> estimation of rates with heterogeneous ATM traffic at 
the uni and 
<p>
<li><em>(v)</em> enhancing the thruput in fast packet switches.
<p>
Dr. Konheim has held adjunct positions at the Balfour School of Science 
(Yeshiva University), CCNY Graduate Center, Courant Institute (New York 
University), and The Technion (Israel).
<p>
He is a member of the MAA, ACM, SIAM and a Senior Member of the IEEE.  
He is on the editorial board of <em> The Mathematical Scientist</em> and 
the <em>Telecommunications Research Journal</em>.
<p>
He is the inventor on four U.S. Patents.
