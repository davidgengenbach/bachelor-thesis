<p>
<strong> I am teaching </strong> (fall 1996) 
two sections of CS170 "Introduction to Algorithms"<br>
together with 
<!WA4><a href="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/csbrochure/faculty/vazirani.html"> 
Umesh Vazirani</a><br>
office hours and TA to be announced.

<p> I am also a CS undergraduate advisor.  Office hours for the week
of August 19:  Tue 10-12, Thu 2-4, Fri 10-12.  <strong> 
Please sign up outside my door for an appointment. </strong>

<p>
<strong> I studied </strong> in Athens Polytechnic (BS in EE 1972)
and Princeton (PhD in CS 1976).  

<p>
Since then,
<strong> I have taught </strong> at Harvard, MIT, Athens 
Polytechnic, Stanford, and UC San Diego.<br>
I came to Berkeley in January 1996 (but I was here also in 1979 as
a Miller fellow).


<p>
<strong> I am interested </strong> in the theory of algorithms and
complexity, and its applications to databases, optimization, AI, 
and game theory.

<p>  
<strong> I have written </strong> these books 
<ul>
<li> <em> Elements of the theory of computation </em> 
(Prentice-Hall 1982, with Harry Lewis, <em> second edition
to appear soon </em>)
<li> <em> Combinatorial optimization: algorithms and complexity
</em> (Prentice-Hall 1982, with Ken Steiglitz)
<li> <em> The theory of database concurrency control </em> 
(CS Press 1988)
<li> <em> Computational Complexity </em> (Addison Wesley, 1994)
</ul>
and many papers.
