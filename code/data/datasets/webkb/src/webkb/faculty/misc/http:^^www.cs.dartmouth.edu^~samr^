<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>
Professor Rebelsky's research interests include <em>programming languages</em>
(particularly lazy <!WA4><a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~samr/functional.html">functional programming</a>,
the use of term rewriting systems in programming, and
techniques for multi-paradigm programming), <em>hypermedia</em> (systems,
interfaces, and retrieval), and the use of <em>computers in education</em>.  
His thesis research was on the design and use of a demand-driven term-based
communication system.

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>
I'm teaching two courses this term: <!WA6><a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~samr/Courses/CS4.97W">CS4</a>, a survey
course intended for nonmajors and <!WA7><a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~samr/Courses/CS68.97W">CS68</a>, a 
majors-only course on programming languages.
</p>

<p>
I've taught a number of courses at <!WA8><a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/">Dartmouth College</a> and <!WA9><a
href="http://www.uchicago.edu">The University of Chicago</a>, including
introductory calculus, introductory programming (parts 1 and 2),
undergraduate programming langauges, graduate programming languages,
computer science for nonmajors, undergraduate operating systems and
undergraduate networking.
</p>

<p>
I also teach the occasional continuing education course, often on subjects
pertaining to electronic publishing.  These days, I've been teaching HTML
to a number of groups, and therefore maintain a rough collection of
<!WA10><a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~samr/HTML/html-links.html">online HTML references</a>.  I'm also starting
to teach JavaScript to a number of people (primarily in preparation for
using it in our nonmajors course) and have created some
<!WA11><a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~samr/JavaScript/">JavaScript reference materials and examples</a>.

<h2>Fun</h2>
<p>
I'll admit that most of my free time is spent with my wife and new son
(born July 31, 1996)
</p>
<p>
On a completely separate note, also maintain the
<!WA12><a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~samr/jojofaq.html">Jonathan Richman FAQ</a>, but I
haven't had a lot of time for that in recent months.
</p>
<p>
I also waste my free time collecting music (my tastes vary -- roots rock,
singer-songwriters, power pop, great Boston bands, ...).  One great place
to look for independent music on the net is 
the <!WA13><a href="http://www.ishops.com/ocean/index.html">Indie Ocean</a>, and
I'm not saying that just because they bribed me to.  They carry lots of
great Boston-based musicians, like Barrence Whitfield and Robin Lane.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
This is not a fancy page (but you could tell that).  This is because I
am a strong proponent of <strong>logical</strong> markup, rather than
<em>physical</em> markup.  That is, I believe most HTML authors should
place emphasis on indicating the <strong>role</strong> of each piece of text, 
rather than the <em>appearance</em> of that text.
