<P>
In Fall 1996, I am teaching two courses.
<!WA1><A href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/g/50/index.html">COMP 50: Computing on the Internet</A>
is an introduction to computing and to the Internet for those with little
or no background with computers.  
<!WA2><A href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/g/40/index.html">COMP 40: Computer Architecture</A>
treats aspects of computer hardware that are most relevant to software 
development.
In the past, I have also taught courses in compilers, parallel computing,
and operating systems.
<p>

My 
<!WA3><A href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~dwk/research.html">research</A>
interests include discrete mathematics, parallel computing,
and system software.  
<p>

My personal interests include playing soccer, hiking and nontechnical 
climbing, music (I play numerous instruments, none well), and photography.
My wife and I live in Winchester, Mass.
We have two children; one is at Colorado College and the other is a graduate 
of Carleton College now at Cornell Law School.
<p>

I grew up in Oklahoma and went to school at the University of
California at Berkeley where I earned a bachelor's degree in
Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and a Ph.D. in
Applied Mathematics. 
With my family, I
have traveled extensively in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.
