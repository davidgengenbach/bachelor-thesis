<h2>My History Up to Today</h2>
I received my Ph.D. at Berkeley under Prof. Eugene Wong, working on database
design and translation within the Ingres Relational Database project. I had the good fortune to have also worked one summer with the System-R Relational Database Group at IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory, so I was located in the center of the relational database design and implementation universe.<p>
After my Ph.D., and some career fits and starts, I landed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I shifted my interests into VLSI and CAD, in particular, database support for VLSI CAD environments. I was so successful, that an opportunity presented itself to return to Berkeley in 1983, which I accepted gladly, selling my snow tires. Since that time, my research and teaching interests have focused on the design, engineering, and implementation of advanced high performance computing systems.<p>

Always one to exhibit a short attention span, in 1984 I switched from CAD to processor and memory system design. Between 1985 and 1989, I led the design of the distributed cache and virtual memory organization of the SPUR multiprocessor project. We invented the term "snooping caches" (also known as "snoopy" caches), and implemented one of the first invalidation protocols. The overall SPUR project was led by Dave Patterson, and involved Richard Fateman, Paul Hilfinger, Dave Hodges, and John Ousterhout. Snooping cache schemes are used in many multiprocessor servers on the market today.<p>

In 1986, I had an idea for building high performance storage systems by ganging together a large number of small formfactor disk drives, much like the processors in a multiprocessor. Between 1987 and 1992, I led the design and implementation of the Berkeley RAID (Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks) high performance storage system (we coined the term "RAID"). This work was done in overall collaboration with Dave Patterson and John Ousterhout. Click <!WA16><a href="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~randy/RaidI.jpg">here</a> for a picture of "RAID the First" and <!WA17><a href="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~randy/RaidII.jpg">here</a> for a picture of "RAID the Second," which is <i>still</i> functional in 1996. <!WA18><a href="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~randy/RaidIIa.jpg">This</a> is the innovative "shelves of disks" that gave us such incredible MBytes per square foot for its time (72 3.5" disks in a 19" rack). This multibillion dollar per year industry all started with a simple idea in Berkeley in 1986! Too bad I didn't get any royalities.<p>

Unsatisfied with academic life "as usual," and after the elections of 1992, I decided to take a leave during 1993-1994 at the Computing Systems Technology Office (now "Information Technology Office") of the <!WA19><a href="http://ftp.arpa.mil">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a>. I started as a program manager and ended as an office deputy director. However, along the way, I was responsible for establishing whitehouse.gov and the president and vice.president Internet mail accounts, I participated on Vice President Gore's 
<!WA20><a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/npr/nptoc.html">National Performance Review</a>, and played a lead role in formulating the 
<!WA21><a href="http://www.hpcc.gov">Federal HPCC program's</a> Information
Infrastructure Technology and Applications research program in support
of the Administration's

Infrastructure</a> Initiative.<p>

On July 1, 1996, I became the first Computer Scientist to be the Chair of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

<!WA27><img src="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~randy/BARWAN.gif" align="left" hspace=6>
Growing out of Bob Brodersen's <!WA28><a href="http://infopad.eecs.Berkeley.edu/">InfoPad Project</a>, we have been working to develop wireless networking and applications support technologies that make it possible to support seamless roaming within buildings and over the wide area, while efficiently supporting applications that process real-time streams like video as well as web documents.<p>
Our current interest is to examine the issues of wireless/wireline network integration, internetwork operation, and end-to-end quality of service guarantees in the context of a local-area wireless testbed in Soda Hall and a wide-area testbed located in the San Francisco Bay Area. The overall effort, in collaboration with Eric Brewer, is called the
<!WA29><a href="http://daedalus.cs.Berkeley.edu/">Daedalus Project</a>.
The combined in-building, metropolitan-area, and wide-area testbed is called
<!WA30><a href="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~randy/Daedalus/BARWAN/BARWAN_index.html">BARWAN</a> (Bay Area Research Wireless Access Network). This work is supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under its <!WA31><a href="http://glomo.sri.com/glomo/">GloMo Program</a>.<br clear="left">
<h2>Heterogeneous Collaboration Environments</h2>
<!WA32><img src="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~randy/collab.gif" align="left" hspace=6>
With Steve McCanne, who is joining the faculty this year, we are studying how to extend the technology we have developed for adapting data representations in real-time into a comprehensive open framework for collaboration. Elements of this new effort include room-sized collaboration environments, extensive enhancements to the existing MBone collaboration tools, and integration of wireless access into the collaboration environment. We expect to deploy these technologies in a classroom testbed within Soda Hall.
