<b> Research Interests:</b> Parallel computing, parallel programming 
tools and systems, scheduling and compilation, scientific computing
and digitial libraries. 


<P> 
Tao Yang received the B.S. degree in Computer Science from Zhejiang University,
China, in 1984,  the M.E. degree in Artificial Intelligence from Zhejiang 
University in 1987. He received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees 
in Computer Science  from Rutgers University in 1990 and 1993.
He joined the Department of Computer Science at UCSB in 1993 as an 
Assistant Professor. 

<P> Dr. Yang is a member of the Parallel Systems Group at UCSB. His main 
research interests are 
algorithms and programming environments for parallel and distributed processing,
program scheduling and compilation,  and parallel scientific computing.
He has proposed efficient scheduling algorithms and
developed a parallel programming system for exploring task parallelism on 
message-passing machines, and applied this system in scientific computing.  
He has also conducted the research on parallel numerical algorithms and
knowledge-based systems. Dr. Yang is currently investigating the 
partitioning and scheduling methods and systems for program parallelization, 
irregular sparse matrix computations and WWW/digital libraries.

<P> Dr. Yang is a PC member and the tutorials chair for <!WA1><a href="http://www.ippsxx.org/"> IPPS'97
(11th Inernational Parallel Processing Symposium)</a>, 
a PC member and local organizer of 
 <!WA2><a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/Conferences/IRREGULAR96/"> Irregular'96

local arrangements and registration co-chair for the 
ACM PPoPP (Symposium on Principle and Practice of Parallel Programming)
and ACM SPAA (Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures) in 1995.
Dr. Yang is  on the editorial boards of
Journal Discrete Mathematics \& Theoretical Computer Science and the
Journal of Computing and Information, and a guest editor for a special issue 
on partitioning and scheduling in Journal Parallel Processing Letters. 
Dr. Yang received the Research Initiation Award from NSF in 1994,
UC Regents' Junior Faculty Award in 1994 and
the Outstanding Computer Science Professor of the Year Award in 1995.
He is  a member of ACM, IEEE, and SIAM.
