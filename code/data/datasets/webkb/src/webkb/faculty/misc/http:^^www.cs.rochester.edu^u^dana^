Introduction to Natural Computation (Due 97)</A>
<P>
Dana Ballard's main research interest is in computational theories of
the brain with emphasis on human vision. In 1985 with
Chris Brown, he led a team that designed and built a high speed
binocular camera control system that is capable of simulating human
eye movements. The system is mounted on a robotic arm that allows it
to move at one meter per second in a two meter radius workspace.
<P>
This system has led to an increased understanding of the role of
behavior in vision. The theoretical aspects of that system were
summarized in a paper ``Animate Vision,'' which received the Best
Paper Award at the 1989 International Joint Conference on Artificial
Intelligence.
<P>
Dana is also interested in models of the brain that relate to detailed
neural models. With <!WA3><A HREF = "http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/rao"> Raj Rao</A>, Virginia DeSa, 
Steve Whitehead and Andrew McCallum, he has been
investigating the role of reinforcement learning in the learning of
simple tasks such as Block Stacking. The solutions that can be learned
are suboptimal but extend to complex environments that cannot be
handled by traditional approaches. This work has been the basis for
the study of human eye and hand movements using virtual environments.
Other research is directed towards learning more general visuo-motor
behaviors. Lambert Wixson and Polly Pook have combined the vision
system with the Department's Utah dextrous hand. Virginia deSa has
studied temporally correlated visuo-motor signals using neural
network models.
