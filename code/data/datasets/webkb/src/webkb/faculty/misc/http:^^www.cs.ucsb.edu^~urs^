<P>My research centers around programming languages (in particular, object-oriented
languages) and their efficient implementation. In my previous life at <!WA1><A HREF="http://www-cs.stanford.edu">Stanford</A>,
I developed an optimizing compiler for the pure object-oriented language
<!WA2><A HREF="http://self.smli.com">Self</A> which removed a large part of the
overhead traditionally associated with message passing. The resulting Self
system outperforms comparable systems (such as commercial Smalltalk implementations)
by a factor of two to three on some medium-sized (500-line) benchmarks.
</P>

<P>A second aspect of that project was to integrate optimizing compilation
into an interactive programming environment by developing techniques to
avoid long compilation pauses and to allow source-level debugging of optimized
code. <BR>
</P>

<P>I'm interested in many aspects of language implementation, such as </P>

<UL>
<LI>compiler optimizations to eliminate message sends (profile-based compiler
optimizations, type inference, etc.), </LI>

<LI>efficient dispatch techniques for statically- and dynamically-typed
languages, </LI>

<LI>compiler support for garbage collection (&quot;garbage prevention is
better than garbage collection&quot;), </LI>

<LI>measurements and analyses of the execution characteristics of (optimized)
object-oriented programs, for example, their instruction mix, cache performance
etc., and </LI>

<LI>software engineering related aspects of object-oriented programming,
such as profilers and debuggers for OO programs. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Current projects include optimizing compilers or runtime systems for
Self, C++, and Java. Check out the <!WA3><A HREF="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/oocsb/papers.shtml">publications
page</A> if you're interested in more details. Some of my research results
have recently been incorporated into <!WA4><A HREF="http://www.animorphic.com">Animorphic
Systems</A>' Smalltalk and Java Virtual Machines.</P>

<FONT SIZE=-1>(If my name displays as &quot;H lzle&quot; on your screen,
then your program can't display that funny &quot;o&quot; with the two dots
on top. Changing the font usually helps; e.g., on my system, Times Regular
doesn't work but Times Small or New Century Schoolbook do. The correct
ASCII way to spell my name is &quot;Hoelzle&quot; -- in German, the &quot;o
with Umlaut&quot; expands into &quot;oe&quot;; but often, people also spell
it as &quot;Holzle. It's pronounced like <!WA6><A HREF="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~urs/urs.snd">this</A>.) </FONT></P>
