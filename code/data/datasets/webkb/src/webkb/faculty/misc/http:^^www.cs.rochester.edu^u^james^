<P>
James Allen's research interests span a range of issues covering
natural language understanding, discourse, knowledge representation,
common-sense reasoning and planning. These areas of research are
combined in <!WA3><A HREF="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/research/trains/home.html">the TRAINS project</A>, a long term effort co-directed with
Len Schubert. The TRAINS system is an intelligent planning assistant
that can converse in spoken natural language with a person to create,
discuss and evaluate various plans involving freight shipments by
train. In particular, Allen's research breaks down into two main
subareas, broadly classified as research in discourse and research in
plan reasoning.
<P>
The research in discourse is focused on two-person extended dialogs
in which the speakers have specific tasks to accomplish. An emphasis
in this work is the representation and use of the context of the
dialog to solve problems in semantic interpretations and the
recognition of the intentions underlying the speakers' utterances.
Work in this area has included developing the first computational
model of speech acts, the development of a multi-level plan-based
analysis involving discourse-level plans as well as domain-level
plans, and the development of several different discourse-plan
recognition algorithms. In addition, we are exploring how prosody and
intonation signals discourse intentions and how this interacts with
the plan-based dialog model. While it is important for work to be
formally well-defined and understood, it is equally important that
computational theories can lead to effective implementations. As a
result, a considerable amount of effort has also been made in
developing an expressive hybrid knowledge representation system that
can support complex reasoning about plans and actions.
<P>
The research in plan reasoning draws much of its motivation from the
dialog work. In particular, the representation of plans must support a
wide range of different forms of reasoning: plan construction (i.e.
traditional planning), plan recognition, plan evaluation, and the
communication of plans between agents. Much of our work in this area
has focused on the representation of time and action, and we have
reformulated the planning problem as a problem in temporal reasoning.
Within this framework, we have developed a representation of plans
that is temporally explicit and supports plan construction,
recognition and communication. We are also exploring methods of
temporal reasoning that are viable even with large data sets of
temporal information.
