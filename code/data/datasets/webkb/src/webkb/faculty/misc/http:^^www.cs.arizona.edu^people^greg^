<p>Greg Andrews received a B.S. degree in Mathematics
from Stanford University in 1969 and a Ph.D. degree
in Computer Science from the University of Washington in 1974.
From 1974-79 he was an Assistant Professor at Cornell University.
Since 1979 he has been at The University of Arizona,
where he is currently Professor of Computer Science.
From 1986-93 he chaired the department;
in 1986 he received a distinguished teaching award.

<p>Greg has been on the editorial board of <i>Information Processing
Letters</i> since 1979.
He was the general chair of the Twelfth
ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in 1989
and has been on the program committees of numerous conferences.
From 1988-92 he was on advisory committees
for the computing directorate of the National Science Foundation.
Since 1991 he has been on the Board of Directors of the Computing

<p>Greg's research interests include all aspects of concurrent
programming.
A long-term project has been the design and implementation
of the <!WA1><a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/sr/www/index.html">
SR programming language</a>.
Current work focusses on the development of
<!WA2><a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/filament/index.html">
Filaments</a>, a software package that provides efficent fine-grain
parallelism on a variety of parallel machines.
He has written two books published by Benjamin/Cummings:
<i>Concurrent Programming:  Principles and Practice</i> (1991) and
<i>The SR Programming Language:  Concurrency in Practice</i>
(1993, with Ron Olsson).

<p>When he's not in the department or at home,
Greg can usually be found at some golf course.
He keeps trying to get ready for the PGA Senior Tour, but his
"friends" tell him the tour already has enough caddies.
