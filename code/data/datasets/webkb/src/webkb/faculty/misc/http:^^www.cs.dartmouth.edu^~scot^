		Professor Drysdale's research area is algorithms, primarily 
		computational geometry. Much of his work has dealt with 
		computing a structure called the Voronoi diagram and its 
		geometric dual the Delaunay Triangulation. In particular, 
		he has invented algorithms for computing the Voronoi Diagram 
		of line segments, for Voronoi diagrams when distances are 
		measured by Convex Distance Functions, and for Voronoi diagrams 
		which simulate crystal growth.  He has found ways to use 
		the Delaunay triangulation to find fixed-radius near neighbors, 
		to find the k nearest neighbors of each point in a set, and to 
		enumerate 
		pairs of points in increasing order of interpoint distance. 
		Professor Drysdale has also done work on computing greedy
		triangulations and has been working with a Mechanical 
		Engineer in the area of Numerical Control (NC) machining.
