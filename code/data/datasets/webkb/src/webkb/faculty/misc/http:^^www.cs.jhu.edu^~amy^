<h2> Assistant Professor </h2>

<h2> Education </h2>

<pre>
Ph.D. 	Computer Science 		   University of Pennsylvania 	1988 
M.S.E. 	Computer Science 		   University of Pennsylvania 	1984 
B.S. 	Mathematics and Computer Science   Hofstra University 		1982
</pre>

<h2> Research </h2>

Programming languages, concurrent and distributed systems, real-time
computing, hardware verification, object oriented programming.

<p>

Process algebras have been widely studied for modelling concurrent
processes.  One of Prof. Zwarico's primary research interests is in
extending this formalism so that it can be used in the specification
and analysis of real-time systems and also systems with probabilistic
behavior. Research in this area has produced semantic models for both
real-time and probabilistic processes as well as logics for reasoning
about these processes.

<p>

In addition, she has used some of the techniques from process algebra
in the verification of both synchronous and asynchronous circuits. In
conjunction with Prof. Smith, Prof. Zwarico has developed and proven
correct a method of synthesizing correct gate-level descriptions of
circuits.She and Prof. Smith are also investigating various areas in
the semantics of object oriented programming.
