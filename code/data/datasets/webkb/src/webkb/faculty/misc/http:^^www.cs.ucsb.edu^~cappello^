<strong>Research interests:</strong> Multiprocessor scheduling, self-directed learning.
<p>
Peter Cappello received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Princeton University in 1982. He joined UC Santa Barbara's Department of Computer Science in July of that year. He is a member of the Department's Algorithms and Computational Complexity group, where he currently investigates multi-processor scheduling, systolic arrays, and the relationship between algorithms and architectures for parallel processing.
<p>
He has published journal articles on integer multiplication, special-purpose architectures for digital signal processing, computer-aided design of digital filter chips, parallel algorithms for scientific computations, bit-level systolic algorithms, formal manipulation of systolic algorithms, a programming language for systolic algorithms, and optimal multiprocessor schedules for fundamental algorithms.
Dr. Cappello is a senior member of the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and a member of the IEEE Computer Society, the IEEE Signal Processing Society, and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). He also is a member of the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory, and the IEEE Signal Processing Society's Technical Committee on VLSI, of which he served as founding Chair.
<p>
He chaired the 1984 IEEE Workshop on VLSI Signal Processing, and co-edited VLSI Signal Processing (IEEE Press). He was Program Co-Chair for the 
1994 Int. Conf. on Application Specific Array Processors (ASAP'94), and Conference Co-Chair for 
ASAP'95.
Dr. Cappello is a past Associate Editor of the <em>IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing</em>, and is on the editorial board of the <em>Journal of VLSI Signal Processing</em>.
