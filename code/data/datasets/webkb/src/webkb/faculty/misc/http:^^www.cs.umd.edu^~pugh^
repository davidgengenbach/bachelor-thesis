<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p> This semester (Fall 1996) I'm teaching <!WA10><a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/cmsc430-f96-0201/">CMSC430</a> - aka Compilers.
<p> In the Spring, I'm going to be teaching a new course:
<!WA11><a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/cmsc498p-s97/">CMSC498P - Advanced Object Oriented Programming</a>


<H2>Web stuff</H2>

<UL>
<LI><B>Java stuff</B>: I've compiled a <!WA12><A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java">list
of Java resources</A>, including information about a Java course I offered
via ITV June 5th and 6th.</LI>

<LI><B>Introductory WWW tutorial </B>: I wrote an <!WA13><A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/intro-www-tutorial/">introductory
WWW tutorial</A> you are invited to read. I've written it to bring it up
to date with HTML 2.0.</LI>

I'm building and maintaining web pages for POPL97: the ACM conference on
Principles of Programming Languages, to be held in Paris, 1997.</LI>

<li><b><!WA15><a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/fridayFacultyLunch">Friday faculty lunch</a></b>:
	I organize lunch orders and deliveries for Friday Faculty Lunches.
	As part of this, I've scanned in the menus for a number of
	restraurants in the College Park Area that deliver.

<H2>RESEARCH INTERESTS:</H2>

<P>The design and analysis of practical algorithms and data structures,
both in general and for problems that arise in the implementation of programming
languages and environments are under investigation.</P>

<P>I developed skip lists, a probabilistic data structure that can be used
in place of balanced trees. Although a skip list may not be balanced, the
probability of a skip list being substantially unbalanced is insignificant.
Algorithms for insertion and deletion in skip lists are simpler and faster
than equivalent algorithms for balanced trees.</P>

<P>My current research focuses on compilation techniques for making effective
use of massive parallelism for computationally intensive scientific problems.
I am investigating algorithms for data dependence analysis in program,
programming languages for scientific computations, and a framework for
performing loop transformations of programs to improve their performance
when executed on massively parallel computers.</P>

<P>Most recently, my research has focused on the use of integer programming
algorithms in array data dependence analysis. Although that integer programming
is NP-complete, the Omega test, an algorithm I developed, is efficient
for problems that arise in practice. In examining the question of array
data dependence more closely, I have found that the queries that really
need to be asked are more complicated than can be answered using integer
programming and that we really need decision procedures for a subclass
of Presburger arithmetic. I have been able to extend the Omega test so
that it can answer these queries.</P>
