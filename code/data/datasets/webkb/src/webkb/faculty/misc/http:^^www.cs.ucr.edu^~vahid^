<h2>Education and Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>B.S. in Electrical Engineering, University of Illinois, 
         Urbana-Champaign, 1988.
<li>M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science, University of California,
         Irvine, 1990 and 1994.
<li> R&D engineer, Hewlett Packard, Santa Clara, California.
<li> R&D engineer, AMCC, San Diego, California.

<h2>Research Topics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hardware/software codesign of embedded systems, with emphasis
    on functional partitioning.  An embedded system is almost any 
    computing system other than a desktop computer or server.
    Examples include automobile cruise-control and fuel-injection, 
    aircraft autopilots, telecommunication products, TV set-top
    boxes, network switches, VCR's, camcorders, robot controllers, 
    medical devices, and audio/video encoders and decoders.
    Hardware/software codesign is the problem of designing
    systems implemented with both standard processors and custom
    digital hardware processors.  Tasks include specifying the 
    system's functionality, partitioning the functionality among 
    standard and custom processors, interfacing the hardware and
    software, and simulating the entire system to verify correctness 
    before creating expensive implementations.

<h2>Recent Results</h2>
<ul>
<li> A model for hardware/software partitioning (SLIF-AG).
<li> Demonstration of the advantages of functional partitioning
     over the current structural partitioning approach for
     distributing a system among packages (with Yu-Chin Hsu
     and Thuy Le). 
<li> New system-level transformations (e.g., procedure exlining,
     procedure cloning) that ease the task of exploring size/performance 
     tradeoffs, a task currently accomplished by manually rewriting a 
     specification.
<li> Communication libraries for embedded processor, PC, and FPGA
     data transfer (with Linus Tauro).
</ul>

<h2>Past Results</h2>
<ul>
<li> Definition of the SpecCharts language, a combination
     of VHDL and Statecharts, for simple and natural
     embedded system specification.
<li> Development of the SpecSyn system-design tool, for
     rapid exploration of various hardware/software implementations
     and automatic refinement into a more detailed specification.
