<H2>Amy W. Apon</H2>
<H4>Lecturer of Computer Science</H4>
<hr>

<P>

Dr. Apon received her Ph.D. in Computer Science at
<!WA0><a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/">Vanderbilt University</a> in
August, 1994.
Dr. Apon also holds  an M.S. in computer science and and M.A. in
mathematics from the
<!WA1><a href="http://www.missouri.edu/">University of Missouri-Columbia</a>.
 and has a decade of diverse professional computer science experience.
She was a Software Design Engineer with Texas Instruments from
1983-1986 where she worked on artificial intelligence applications to
large military systems.
She was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science for four years at 
<!WA2><a href="http://www.ecok.edu/">East Central University</a>
 in Ada, Oklahoma, and also at 
<!WA3><A href="http://www.fisk.edu/">Fisk University</a> for one
year. 
She was a Research Instructor 
 in the 
<!WA4><a href="http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/dbmi/">Division of Biomedical
Informatics</a>
 at Vanderbilt University during 1995-1996, where she worked on
computer applications to medicine and on enterprise capacity planning.

<P>
Dr. Apon's research is in the areas of performance evaluation of distributed 
and parallel computer systems and the development of new types of
analytic models of these, including queueing networks, Petri nets,
and simulation models.  
She is also interested in research in the architecture and management of large distributed 
networks and network applications, including
 large medical information systems.
She has authored or coauthored several 
<!WA5><a href="http://www.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~apon/papers.html"> papers </a> in the measurement and modeling
of parallel computer systems.
Many of her collaborators are members of the 
<!WA6><a href="http://cswww.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~peg">Performance Evaluation
Group</a> at Vanderbilt.
She is the recipient of a research grant from the National Science Foundation
for the study of alternative models of distributed and parallel computer systems.

<P>
This year Dr. Apon is teaching in the 
<!WA7><a href="http://cswww.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/">Department of Computer
Science</a> at Vanderbilt.
