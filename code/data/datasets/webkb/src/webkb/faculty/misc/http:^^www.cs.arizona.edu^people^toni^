Pitassi received bachelors and masters degrees from 
Pennsylvania State University
and then received  a PhD from the University of Toronto in
1992. After that, Toni spent 2 years as a postdoc at UCSD,
and then 2 years as an assistant professor (in mathematics with
a joint appt in computer science) at the University of Pittsburgh.
Since September, 1996, she has been at the Department of Computer
Science at the University of Arizona, as an assistant professor.
