<h2>Java for Wavelets</h2>
Java is still a bit painful, but it provides extraordinary potential
for use in research and teaching. Here is a small collection of
subdivision and wavelet related applets that students, collaborators,
and I myself have written. Check them out!
<ul>
  <li>A simple demonstration of how to draw smooth curves through
      <!WA2><a href="http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~ps/java/chaikin.html">corner cutting</a> (and my first
      attempt at Java...). This is an instance of subdivision which is
      intricately linked to wavelet constructions.
  <li>One of the students in CS274b, Dmitri Linde, took this applet
      as a starting point for his <!WA3><a
      href="http://dmitri.caltech.edu/cs284/h2">homework</a>
      assignment. It demonstrates B-splines and Bezier curves of
      varying order and lenght all rolled into one application. They
      are all generated through subdivision.
  <li>Dmitri Linde also implemented his <!WA4><a
      href="http://dmitri.caltech.edu/cs284/proj">CS274b project</a>
      in Java. AWESOME!
  <li>Wim Sweldens wrote a little applet that allows you to explore
      the space of all <!WA5><a
      href="http://netlib.att.com/math/people/wim/cascade/index.html">four tap wavelets</a>.
</ul>
Watch this space for more to come as <!WA6><a
href="http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~astle/proposal.html">Mike Astle</a>
and Dae Kang start hacking Java this summer!

<h3>Research Interests</h3>

My main interest right now is in <b>multi level methods</b>. So far
this has been happening under the headline of <b>wavelets</b>, but we
are generalizing the ideas more and more, so whether it should still
be called wavelets is up to debate. An overview of <!WA19><a
href="http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~ps/Research.html">research projects</a> in the computer graphics
group as a whole gives some more ideas about concrete projects that
are happening or about to happen.

yet. Here are a few
