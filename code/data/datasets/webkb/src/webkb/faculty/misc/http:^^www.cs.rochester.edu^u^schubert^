<P>
Len Schubert's research interests center around language, knowledge
representation, inference and planning. A unifying theme is the
development of foundations for general, extensible story
understanding and conversational systems. This has led to the
development of strategies for human-like, error-tolerant parsing, and
of increasingly expressive logics for capturing the content of natural
language utterances in all their richness. The most recently developed
representation, episodic logic (EL), associates episodes with 
sentences and allows for adjective/adverb-like predicate modifiers, 
property/proposition-forming operators, and other language-like 
constructs, simplifying the process of mapping from language to 
the meaning representation.
<P>
The theoretical investigation of natural language processing and
knowledge representation has been accompanied by the development of
implemented systems intended to support language understanding, 
reasoning and planning. This work has focused on probabilistic 
input-chaining and goal-chaining strategies for plausible inference 
in EL, on concept- and topic-centered strategies for access to 
relevant information, and on provably efficient ``specialists'' 
that accelerate inference about time relationships, taxonomies, 
parts, colors, numbers, and sets.
<P>
The most recent implemented system called EPILOG incorporates all of
these functions and effectively answers questions posed in EL (with
output in English), using general world knowledge about things,
people, events, actions, and causes. Schubert also collaborates with 
James Allen on the TRAINS project, aimed at building a conversationally
proficient interactive planning assistant in a dynamic world. This 
has provided both a context for some of the above work on language 
processing, and an impetus for recent work on ``scalable'' temporal 
reasoning, and on a new approach to the frame problem in planning, 
called ``explanation closure.''
