Yuan-Fang Wang received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering
from National Taiwan University in 1981, and his master's and Ph.D.
degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of
Texas at Austin in 1983 and 1987, respectively.  From 1981 to 1982, he
was a teaching assistant in the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering, and from 1982 to 1987, a research assistant in the
Computer and Vision Research Center, both at the University of Texas at
Austin. He joined the Department of Computer Science at the University
of California at Santa Barbara in 1987, where he is currently an
associate professor.       
<p>
Dr. Wang is a member of the IEEE Computer Society.  He served on
various program committees and chaired several technical sessions in
professional conferences.  He has been a member of the
IEEE PAMI Technical Committee since 1987. 
<p>
Dr. Wang's research activities center around computer vision, image
processing, parallel processing, and computer graphics.  In computer
vision and image processing, he has conducted research on shape
modeling, physically-based 3D reconstruction, sensor data fusion, 3D
shape recognition, analysis of time-varying image sequences, and
analysis of structured light images.  He has also performed research on
designing and implementing distributed, object-oriented 3D graphics
systems, and on developing a practical and reliable image analysis and
tracking algorithm to achieve automated instrument localization and
scope maneuvering in endoscopic surgery.
