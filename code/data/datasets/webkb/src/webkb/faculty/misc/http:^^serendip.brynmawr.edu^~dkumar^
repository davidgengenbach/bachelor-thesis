Welcome to my not so formal and not so structured home page.
No, this home page is not under construction, it is undergoing
a steady evolution. It will serve to provide a glimpse into
my life, and related things.
<p>
I work on Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI, <!WA2><IMG SRC="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/~dkumar/eye.xbm">)
architectures. This research falls in the realm of Artificial
Intelligence. The task is to build models of rational cognitive
agents that are endowed with beliefs, desires, and intentions.
Most of my work has so far been carried in conjuction with the
<!WA3><a href="http://www.cs.buffalo.edu/pub/sneps/WWW/"> SNePS Research Group.</a>
<P>
SNePS is a semantic network processing system. The illustration
below shows a SNePS representation of the sentences:
<p>
<i> All humans are mortal. </i> <br>
<i> Socrates is human. </i> <br>

The above illustration is from January 1991 issue of Scientific American article
<B> Silicon babies </B> where 
<!WA5><a href="http://www.cs.buffalo.edu/pub/WWW/faculty/shapiro/shapiro.html"> Stu Shapiro 
</a> was interviewed after I had
presented some results from my thesis at the AAAI Spring Symposium on
Integrated AI Architectures.

In the summer of 1994, I spent some time traveling in Southern Utah.

People from various eras have left their marks on this rock. A gathering
place of ideas new and old. Sort of what I would like to create in
the <i> cyberspace </i>. Check out some of these efforts on

<b> Where to find me...</b><p>
I live on a computer called blackcat (<i> dkumar@blackcat.brynmawr.edu </i>),
a cross-cultural, ancient, as well as a contemporary icon of things good
and magical. Sort of like the Newspaper Rock.
