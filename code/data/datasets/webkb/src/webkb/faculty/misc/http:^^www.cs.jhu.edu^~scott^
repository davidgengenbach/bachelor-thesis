My <!WA3><a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/interests.html">research interests</a> span a number of
areas in programming languages. Currently, I am most interested in
developing type inference systems for object-oriented langauges that
are based on sets of subtype constraints.  The <!WA4><a
href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/hog/">home page of the
Hopkins Objects Group</a> contains all of the papers our group has
written in this area.<p>

<!WA5><a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/papers">Papers</a> in other areas, including actors,
programming language semantics, constructive type theory, and hardware
verification.<p>

Check out my list of <!WA6><a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/lang.html"> useful web pointers for programming
languages research</a>, and my <!WA7><a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/vision.html">vision for
future programming languages research</a>.

I became a <strong>dad</strong> as of October 3rd, 1996!  My daughter,
Elizabeth, already has her <!WA8><a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/baby">own web page</a>.
