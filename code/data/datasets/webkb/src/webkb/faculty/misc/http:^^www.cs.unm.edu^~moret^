<strong>In Memoriam:</strong>  My good friend and climbing partner Jane
Tennessen died Sunday, June 23, when climbing with two other common friends
in the Sandias.  Jane was 34 years old, a licensed clinical psychologist,
the clinical director of the Santa Fe Rape Crisis Center, and a wonderful
friend -- happy, helpful, and loved climbing.
I have <!WA2><A HREF=http://www.cs.unm.edu/~moret/jane.html>a small tribute</A> to her, along with a pictorial.
She died through human error, not her own -- her only error was to trust too
much in another climber, who took her (experienced and technically sophisticated
at sports climbing, but completely inexperienced on natural routes) and
a novice climber on a serious (5.9+), 8-pitch route with thin protection.
The anchors at a belay station pulled and all three fell to their death.
I mourn her loss.

<h2>Education and Experience</h2>
<ul>
<li>Baccalauréat degrees in Latin, Greek, and Mathematics
<li>Diploma of Electrical Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology<br>
    (<!WA3><a HREF="http://www.epfl.ch/">Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale</a>) of Lausanne
<li>Software and firmware engineer for Omega Electronic in Bienne for 2 years
<li>MS and PhD in Electrical Engineering from the
   <!WA4><a HREF="http://www.utk.edu/">University of Tennessee</a>
<li>On the faculty of the Department of Computer Science since 1980<br>
    (Chairman from 1991 until 1993)
</ul>
<p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<ul>
<li>pattern recognition
<li>complexity theory
<li>algorithmic paradigms
<li>computational geometry
<li>the empirical assessment of algorithms and data structures
<li>applications of the above to practical problems, especially 3D simulation
</ul>
He has published over 30 papers in these areas and co-authored (with Henry Shapiro)
a graduate text on algorithms; a <!WA5><a HREF="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~moret/papers.html">list of publications</a>
(and Postscript versions of some of them) is available.  He is the Editor-in-Chief of
the <!WA6><a HREF="http://www.jea.acm.org">ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics.</a>
<p>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
In the Department, he teaches courses in algorithms and data structures,
in computational geometry, in parallel algorithms, in complexity theory,
in computability theory, and in pattern recognition.
