His interests are in all aspects of workstation cluster computing.
While at Stanford, he was involved in the design and implementation of
the V-System.
At Rice, he has worked on two distributed shared memory systems, Munin and 
<!WA6><a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~willy/TreadMarks/overview.html">TreadMarks</a>,

memory-based permanent storage system.
He has also worked with Alejandro Schaffer on
<!WA8><a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~schaffer/fastlink.html"> FASTLINK</a>,
a project to provide fast sequential and parallel genetic linkage analysis
software.<p>
