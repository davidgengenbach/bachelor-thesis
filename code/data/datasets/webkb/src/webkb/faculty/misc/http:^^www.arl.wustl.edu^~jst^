<h1>Selected Current Research Projects</h1>
<i>Extending ATM Networks for Reliable Multicast</i>.
This project involves extending ATM switches to assist in the provision of
end-to-end reliable multicast in which the amount of work that must be done
by senders and receivers is essentially independent of the size of the
multicast. It involves the addition of several mechanisms to ATM switches.
One mechanism provides <i>redundant acknowledgement suppression</i>
so that senders receive only a single acknowledgement for every packet sent.
A second mechanism allows multiple senders on a many-to-many multicast to
send multi-cell packets on a single virtual circuit without losing the
ability to properly demultiplex them at the receiver. This is done using
a <i>dynamic virtual circuit subchannel mechanism</i>.
Details can be found in
in a recently completed
<!WA2><a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/cs/techreports/1996/wucs-96-16.ps.Z">technical report</a> and

<i>Gigabit ATM Switching.</i>
We're nearing completion of a set of three chips and
associated hardware and software that implements a uniquely scalable and
flexible
<!WA4><a href=http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~jst/gigatech/gigatech.html>ATM switch</a>.
supporting link speeds from 150 Mb/s to 2.4 Gb/s and
capable of supporting configurations with total throughputs from 10 Gb/s
to more than 10 Tb/s.
This system uses a unique cell recycling technique for multicast
switching which has optimal scaling properties, allowing large
switches to be implemented for a fraction of the cost of competing
architectures

This work is part of a major ARPA-funded project on

network technology</a>.
<p>
<i>ATM Network Design</i>.
Classical network design techniques are not well-equipped to cope with
the design of ATM networks, which are characterized by statistically
unpredictable traffic and a wide range of different application types
with diverse requirements, including multicast. Network design methods
that allow network managers to define traffic requirements at a fairly
gross level and adopt a worst-case approach to network design appear
to be more appropriate.
See the following reports for recent results
[<!WA9><a href=http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~jaf/jaf-dissertation.ps.Z>FI94</a>,<!WA10><a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/cs/techreports/1996/wucs-96-03.ps.Z">FI96a</a>,<!WA11><a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/cs/techreports/1996/wucs-96-06.ps.Z">FI96b</a>].
<p>
<i>Distributed Control of ATM Networks</i>
The design of ATM switching hardware is now fairly well-understood.
However, distributed control systems for effectively managing large scale networks (with thousands or millions of terminals) remain unavailable.
While a number of proposals have been put forward in the ATM Forum,
there is a limited understanding of how competing approaches compare
with respect to performance, use of network resources and even correctness.
We are developing a framework for precisely defining and analyzing
network control systems that allows the essential issues to be separated
from the welter of protocol and implementation details that often make
it difficult to make meaningful
comparisons [<!WA12><a href="ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/doc/techreports/wustl.edu/cs/1995/wucs-95-12.ps.Z">TU95b</a>]
and using this framework to develop precise characterizations
of new approaches to distributed network control
[<!WA13><a href="ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/doc/techreports/wustl.edu/cs/1995/wucs-95-09.ps.Z">WU95</a>]. In addition, we have designed and are implementing a particular
network control system details of which can be found in

<h1>Selected Past Research Activities</h1>
<i>Queueing Analysis of Multistage Switching Networks</i>. Multistage
switching networks are among the simplest and most cost-effective
architectures for large ATM switching systems. This work developed
new methods for analyzing queueing performance for these systems,
in order to improve accuracy and extend them to handle shared-buffer
switch elements and alternative flow control strategies

<p>
<i>Nonblocking Multirate Switching</i>. This work extends the classical
theory of nonblocking networks to apply to switching systems supporting
communication channels with different rates that can share the capacity
of both external links and internal switch data paths. It applies directly
to multirate circuit switching and ATM switching systems that use static
routing. We've obtained results generalizing classical results for
both point-to-point [<!WA23><a href="http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~jst/pubs/infocom89.ps.Z">ME89a</a>,<!WA24><a href="http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~jst/pubs/siamjc89.ps.Z">ME89b</a>] and
multipoint [<!WA25><a href="http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~jst/pubs/ieee293a.ps.Z">ME93a</a>] switching systems.
<p>
<i>Analysis of Algorithms for Hard Combinatorial Problems</i>.
This research centers on methods for analyzing the performance of
algorithms for hard combinatorial problems. We are interested in both
worst-case analysis and probabilistic analysis. The probabilistic analyses
make use of problem-specific probability distributions selected to
help clarify real differences among competing algorithms
