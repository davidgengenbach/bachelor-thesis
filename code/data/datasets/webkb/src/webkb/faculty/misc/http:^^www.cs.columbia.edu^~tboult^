This is Terry Boult's home page. Mouse my face for a color photo.
<p>


I am now a <em> visiting scientist </em> in the <!WA2><a
href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> of <!WA3><a
href="http://www.cc.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a>.  I'm an Associate
professor in the <!WA4><a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/www/www-data/eecs.html">EE/CS
department</a> of <!WA5><a href="http://www.lehigh.edu">Lehigh University</a>. 
<p>

My research interests span vision, numeric computing, information-based
complexity, image processing, object oriented software, and light-wave
networks.  To learn more about my research see  <!WA6><a
href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tboult/research.html>TBoult's Research Page</a> 

<p>

I am also an ex-Columbia-faculty (86-94), an ex-Columbia-graduate
student (MS in CS 83-84, Ph.D. in CS 84-86) and an ex-Columbia-undergraduate
(B.S. Applied Math 79-83).  As a doctoral student I received an IBM graduate
fellowship.  I was awarded an NSF Presidential Young Investigator (1990) and
have support from NSF (3 other grants), ARPA, and industrial funding from
AT&T, IBM, Texas Instruments and Siemens.  Eight CU doctoral students have
graduated under my direction, two of them (G. Wolberg and L. Wolff) have
since won NSF NYI's.  In 1990 I received the NCR Stakeholder award which is
given from time to time to an outstanding EE or CS faculty member at
Columbia.

<p>

While I'm not paid by Columbia, I still visit a bit because I have students here
including Ph.D. students: 
<ul>
<li><!WA7><a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tboult/Symlinks/brown>Lisa Brown</a>
<li><!WA8><a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tboult/Symlinks/chiang>Ming Chao Chiang</a>
<li><!WA9><a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tboult/Symlinks/fenster>Sam Fenster</a>
<li><!WA10><a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tboult/Symlinks/odonnell>Tom O'Donnell</a>
</ul>
and few undergraduates and MS students.  
<ul>
<li><!WA11><a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tboult/Symlinks/russell>M. "Russell" Sarder</a>
<li><!WA12><a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tboult/Symlinks/veronica/>Veronica Hidalgo</a>
</ul>
<p>

I maintain research connections to the <!WA13><a
href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/robotics/">Vision/Robotics Lab</a> with
	<ul>
<li> <!WA14><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/robotics/people/allen.html">Prof Peter
Allen</a>
<li> <!WA15><a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tboult/Symlinks/kender>Prof. John Kender</a> and 
<li> <!WA16><a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tboult/Symlinks/nayar>Prof. Shree Nayar</a><p>
</ul>

I also have research collaborations with the information-based complexity
group of 
<ul>
<li><!WA17><a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tboult/Symlinks/traub>Prof. J.F.Traub</a>
<li><!WA18><a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tboult/Symlinks/henryk>Prof. H. Wozniakowski</a>
<li><!WA19><a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tboult/Symlinks/agw>Visiting Prof. Art Werschulz</a>
<li> <!WA20><a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tboult/Symlinks/paskov>S. Paskov</a>
and
<li><!WA21><a href=http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tboult/Symlinks/simon>S. Baker</a>
</ul>
See also <!WA22><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cacnet">CAC-NET</a> which is  an electronic
conferencing  system for researchers in algorithms and complexity.<p>

I dabble a bit in many things including vision, numeric computing, image
processing, object oriented software, and light-wave networks.  I 
also enjoy Baking, board games, boating, cooking, fishing,
guitar,  golf, hiking, poetry, racket sports, scuba diving, skiing/shredding,
swimming, volleyball and water skiing. (When I get the time, of course ;-)
I'm even decent at a few of these, e.g. I
placed first in the 1991-1992 Budweiser/NASTAR All-star ranking for New Jersey
skiers in the 30-39 age bracket with a time was just 5\% behind that
posted by the NASTAR National Pace-setter, U.S. Olympian Matt Grosjean.
