My interests include Scientific programming environments; Algebraic
manipulation by computer (programs like Macsyma, Mathematica, Maple,
Axiom, Reduce); Distributed computing; analysis of algorithms;
Programming and measurement of large systems; Design and
implementation of programming languages; Optical character
recognition. 

<P> There is a public ftp repository of programs, papers, and 
reviews written by my students and myself ...
I've linked a subset of them here: 
<!WA1><A HREF="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~fateman/algebra.html">Berkeley computer algebra papers</A>.
 Some pointers to work in symbolic mathematical computing
can be found by visiting <!WA2><A HREF="http://symbolicnet.mcs.kent.edu/">
SymbolicNet</A>.
<p>
You might also visit <!WA3><A HREF="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~fateman/ocrpapers.html">Berkeley OCR/math papers</A>.
If you are interested in an ambitious senior project OCR
program using C++, Tcl/TK, visit <!WA4><A HREF="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~fateman/kathey/ocrchie.html">OCRchie</A>.
<p>
You might like to visit
our prototype TILU on-line table-lookup
<!WA5><A HREF="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~fateman/htest.html">Symbolic Integration Service</A>.
<br>
You can also get a copy of 2171 integrals that TILU can do, and see if
you can do them all, and if you can do them faster. This
table combines many simple examples (for timing) and a few
harder ones near the end (for challenges).  This is a preliminary
version, and doesn't include that much of the literature on integration
yet. Here's
the <!WA6><A HREF="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~fateman/examples.in">list of examples</A> as of May 23, 1996.
It is 163k bytes.  We have a file with the answers too, naturally.
Our answers may be more cautious than those that come out of a
computer algebra system. For example, our answers will
sometimes include variations that depend
on constraints on the parameters in the integrand. If you
wonder what our answer is, you can try TILU: paste the integrand -- the part
between "(INTEGRATE" and " X)" into the input box, set up 
appropriate limits, and execute the query.
<p>
Computer algebra fans may also wish to see work done by my colleague
<!WA7><A HREF="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~jfc/">John Canny</a>.
and his students, including applications
of algebraic algorithms.

Other work at Berkeley
by colleagues in scientific computing can be found by following the
links to their home pages:
<!WA8><A HREF="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/">James Demmel</a> and
<!WA9><A HREF="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/">William Kahan</a>.
<p>
Visitors to this page
may be interested in a Common Lisp package and libraries
called
<!WA10><A HREF="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~fateman/mma.mailer">Mockmma</A>.

To the user, this somewhat resembles Mathematica (tm),
but has the advantage of being totally open (full source code).
One can manipulate polynomials in several variables over the integers,
rational functions, and a variety of other mathematical
objects. Manipulations include simplification, differentiation, integration,
evaluation, pattern matching, etc. 
<P>
Some of you may wonder what kind of optical character recognition
we are doing on equations, so you might wish to see
<!WA11><A HREF="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~fateman/ocr.html">a few scanned equations </A> 
to see what this is about.
We are also drafting a brief
discussion on an <!WA12><A HREF="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~fateman/ocrchallenge.html">OCR equation-recognition
challenge </A>.
We hope to develop more expertise
in understanding documents as part of an
<!WA13><A HREF="http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu"> Electronic
Environmental Library Project.</A>
<P>

I am on sabbatical in the  Fall, 1996 semester, but I expect to
continue running a seminar discussing issues of the electronic library
project
<!WA14><a href="http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~fateman/docstruct.html"> CS298-23,
document structure analysis </a>.
