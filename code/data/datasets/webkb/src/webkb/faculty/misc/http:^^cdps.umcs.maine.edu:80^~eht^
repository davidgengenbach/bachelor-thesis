Elise H. Turner (Assistant Professor, Computer Science) began her appointment
at the University of Maine in September, 1995.  Prior to that, she was a
faculty member at the University of New Hampshire since 1989.  She received the
Ph.D. degree from the <!WA1><A HREF="http://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Institute of
Technology</A> in 1989 (thesis area: artificial intelligence, natural language

Professor Turner's research interests and publication areas include:
communication during multi-agent problem solving, discourse
processing, planning in real-world domains, the interaction between
communication and problem solving; distributed artificial intelligence, in
particular cooperative 
distributed problem solving (CDPS); and cognitive science.  She is the
director of the <b>COLA</b> project to develop a language for cooperating
underwater vehicles and a project to develop methods for selecting information
to include in problem solving dialogues (NSF
Grant No. IRI-9309703).   She is also  co-founder of the UNH <!WA2><A
