</PRE>

Dr. Joshi was born in New Delhi, India, many (or not so many, depending on
your POV) moons ago. Assorted geeeky acts like memorising the schedule for 
Indian Railways (North Zone) at an early age showed to all and sundry that he
was destined to be a Professor. He set out to fulfil this prediction with
gusto, in the process asking long, complicated and troublesome questions of his
teachers at Modern School and <!WA3><A HREF="http://www.iitd.ernet.in/">IIT Delhi</A>. 
While in his senior years in high school, and through his undergraduate 
education, he continued his interest in asking (and answering) questions by
representing his institutions in debating and quizzing at an intercollegiate
level. He also got involved in research activities, which lead him to <!WA4><A HREF="http://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue</A>
University in 1989, from where he obtained his Ph.D degree in 1993. Currently,
 he is found raoming the campus of the <!WA5><A HREF="http://www.missouri.edu"> University of Missouri</A> in the guise of an assistant professor. He 
continues to ask many questions, though he concentrates on answering only
some of them. These are detailed next .....   


<H2>Research</H2>
<!WA6><IMG SRC="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse/softlab/../gifs/softlab/softlab-logo-small.gif"> 

My research focusses on <I>Intelligent Networked Systems </I>, and covers the
broad area of <B> Networked Systems</B> and <B>Artificial/Computational
Intelligence</B>. Of particular interest to me is the use of <I>Distributed
AI (Adaptive MultiAgent Systems)</I> and <I>soft AI (NeuroFuzzy Learning)</I>
approaches. I am working on using techniques from Computational Intelligence
and Agent-based systems to aid in the effort of realizing
<I>MetaComputing</I> or <I>Networked computing</I>, especially for the
Scientific Computing domain. This involves creating problem solving
environments <I>(PSEs)</I> which make the underlying neworked and distributed
system transparent to the user.  This work also looks at supporting mobile
and ubiquitous platforms by making systems <I>mobile aware</I>. To this end
we do research in various facets of <B>Mobile Computing</B>. I also
investigate and using such systems with <B>multimedia</B> to improve
<I>education</I> and <I>telelearning</I>. This work was started while I was at Purdue, as a part of the
efforts of the PSEs group (<!WA7><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/jrr">John
Rice</A>, <!WA8><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/enh">Elias Houstis</A> and
<!WA9><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/saw">Sanjiva Weerawarana</A>) and
the Telematics group (<!WA10><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/ake">Ahmed
Elmagarmid</A>, <!WA11><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/enh">Elias
Houstis</A> and <!WA12><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/mja">Mike
Atallah</A>).
<BR>
Another current research activity deals <B>computer &amp; human vision</B>, and explores the
nature of motion correspondence process in biological systems, using relevant
information from Neurobiology and Psychophysics. I am also working on 
understanding the effect of the geometry of visual space on the human ability
to solve difficult problems. This work is done jointly with Prof. Zygmunt Pizlo of the <!WA13><A HREF="http://www.psych.purdue.edu/">Psychology</A> department at Purdue.
