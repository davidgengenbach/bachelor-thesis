Pat received her B.A., M.S., and Ph.D. from <!WA3><A href="http://www.nyu.edu">New York University</A>.  Her Ph.D.
advisers were Drs. <!WA4><A href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/gottlieb/index.html"> 
Allan Gottlieb</A> and <!WA5><A href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/grishman/index.html">Ralph Grishman</A>.  She is a member of
Phi Beta Kappa and an honorary member of the Golden Key National Honor 
Society.  Before joining NMSU, Teller was a visiting researcher at IBM
T. J. Watson Research Center.  Dr. Teller's main research interests are 
parallel and distributed computing, computer architecture, operating systems,
and performance evaluation.  These research interests are the main focus
of her Parallel Research Group at NMSU.  Dr. Teller's research has been
funded by Sandia National Laboratories, the U. S. Army Research Office, and
Los Alamos National Laboratory. Teller is a reviewer for major conferences
and journals and has been on the program committee of several major 
conferences.  She has been invited to speak at various workshops, conferences,
universities, and industrial centers.

<p>
Abstract.  Trace-driven simulation of shared-memory architectures can be as 
accurate as execution- or program-driven simulations for a large class of 
parallel programs. Traces for programs in this class can be scheduled or 
unscheduled. A scheduled trace is a set of traces generated by running a
parallel program on a real or simulated MP, while an unscheduled trace is an 
augmented trace generated by running a parallel program on a uniprocessor. 
Scheduled traces can be used to drive simulations of only MP systems with the 
same number of processors as the MP that generated the trace and are limited 
to the same static task-to-processor scheduling as the MP that generated the 
trace. In contrast, unscheduled traces offer much more flexibility. In this 
paper we show how unscheduled traces can be used to simulate dynamic task-to-
processor scheduling, MP systems of different sizes, and multiprogramming. In 
addition, we show how an unscheduled trace allows the task granularity of a 
traced program to be varied from simulation to simulation and how operating
system references can be inserted dynamically during simulation.

<h2> <!WA17><A href="http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~teller/CS579.Fall95/index.html"> 
CS579 Simulation of Computer Architectures </A> </h2>.
CS579 is a special topics course for graduate students.  The course will
cover research in the area of simulation of computer architectures, both
uniprocessor and multiprocessors architectures.  
You can examine the syllabus of the course, lecture notes, and 
papers that are being analyzed by the students, among other things.

<h2> CS273 Course Materials</h2>  
<p>CS273 is a course in Machine Organization and Assembly Language.  This course is described in "Mobile robots teach machine-level programming",
which will appear in the proceedings of Supercomputing '95.  Course materials,
including transparencies and a MC68HC11 simulator with a graphical user 
interface
will be available at this WWW site during or before December 1995.
