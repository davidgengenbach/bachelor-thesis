in operating systems and programming methodology in France and working
on the specification, design, and verification of fault-tolerant
software in England, he joined IBM Research in 1982.  While at IBM,
he worked in the area of fault-tolerant distributed systems and 
protocols.  After joining UCSD in 1991, he founded the Dependable
