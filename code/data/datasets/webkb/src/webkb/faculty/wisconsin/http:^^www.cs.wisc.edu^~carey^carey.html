<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<i>Database management systems, parallel and distributed computing,
applied performance evaluation.</i><p>
My research interests lie in two main areas:  database system performance
and next-generation database systems.  In the performance area, topics
of current interest include performance tradeoffs and techniques for
object-oriented database systems, design and evaluation of algorithms
related to transaction processing, and scheduling of complex multi-user
database workloads based on user-specified performance goals.
In the next-generation database system area, I have been involved in the
EXODUS extensible DBMS project;  I am now involved in SHORE, a project aimed
at developing a scalable repository for the storage and sharing of persistent
objects in a heterogeneous environment.  The goal of the SHORE effort, which
is building upon experience from the EXODUS project, is to meet the object
management needs of (and to replace the use of Unix files in) applications
such as CAD/CAM and CASE.
<p>
Most recently, I have moved from academia to industry.  After twelve great
years as a part of what's become the best academic database systems research
group in the known universe, the time has come for me to tackle some new and
different challenges.  I am now working at the IBM Almaden Research Center (the
source of a number of of the papers that I've been teaching to my students for
the past twelve years).  My IBM work will be related to objects and databases,
with a significant fraction of my time being spent on a relatively new project
there called Garlic.  Garlic is an effort to build a heterogeneous multimedia
information system that allows data living in a variety of repositories to
be queried and manipulated as though it resided in one, homogeneous, object
database.  I spent 1993-94 on sabbatical at IBM working on Garlic, continued
to work on it in Madison in 1994-95 (focusing, with a graduate student, on a
query/browser front-end tool called PESTO), and am once again working on the
Garlic project "on location" at IBM Almaden.
