<P> <H1>Bienvenido!</H1>

<P> I'm a new staff member working on the Paradyn Project. I just finished my
Ph.D. at the <EM>University of Southampton</EM> in England and I did my 
undergrad and MSc at the <EM>Universidad Simon Bolivar</EM> (Caracas, Venezuela).

<P> I was born in the beautiful city of Barquisimeto, Venezuela. Barquisimeto
is located on the central-western part of Venezuela and has a population of
about 1 million people. Barquisimeto is also known as the 
<EM>musical capital</EM> of Venezuela. 

<P> My main research area is Performance Analysis and Visualization of 
Parallel Programs. However, apart from being a researcher, I like to play
classical guitar. In fact, I studied for a few years with two excellent
<EM>maestros</EM>: Rodrigo Riera and Antonio Lauro.

<P> I like to spend my time:
<UL>
<LI> Playing guitar 
<LI> Reading good books (e.g. Sherlock Holmes stories) 
<LI> Cooking
<LI> Watching baseball
<LI> And working too!! :-)
</UL>
