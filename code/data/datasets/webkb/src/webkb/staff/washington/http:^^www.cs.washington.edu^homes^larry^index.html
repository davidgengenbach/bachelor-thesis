<BODY><P>
<b> Larry McMurchie</b>, Director, NW Laboratory for Integrated
Systems, has a BA in Chemistry from Western Washington University
(1971) and a Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Washington.  He
worked in the area of Quantum Chemistry during his graduate studies.
His primary focus was the numberical evaluation of a class of
integrals over Gaussian functions.  He later applied this work to the
construction of large sparse Hamiltonian matrices.  He is a coauthor
of a comprehensive package of computer programs (MELD) used in <i> ab
initio</i> calculations on small molecules.
  
<P>
Since joining the staff of the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering, Larry has supervised the work of the technical staff of
the Laboratory for Integrated Systems.  He was a coauthor or WireC, a
schematic capture system that allows designers to mix C code with
schematic symbols to creat a concise, parameterizable representation
of a design.  Larry was also involved in the development and
commercialization of the MacTester, an integrated software/hardware
environment for the functional testing of chips, boards and
subsystems.  Recently he has worked in the area of CAD for FPGAs and
has developed a general purpose performance-driven router for FPGAs.
