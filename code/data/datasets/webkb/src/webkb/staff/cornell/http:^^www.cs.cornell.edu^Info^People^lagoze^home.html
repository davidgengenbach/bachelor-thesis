distributed digital library servers accessible over the World

My primary research involves defining the services and protocols
for an interoperable digital library infrastructure. In this area,
I have collaborated with the <!WA13><!WA13><!WA13><!WA13><!WA13><!WA13><!WA13><!WA13><A HREF="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us">Corporation for National Research Initiatives</A>

in Warwick, U.K. Finally, and also as part of this work, I am
very interested in extending the World Wide Web using distributed
object technology. You can read my <!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><A HREF="http://cs-tr/~lagoze/w3c-omg.html">position paper</A>

<P>
There is more to me than this research. Who knows, you may meet
me at a conference, workshop, or meeting and find that out. As
a poor substitute for personal contact, let me say a little more
about me.
<P>
That character on my lap in the picture at the top of this page
is Lucy, my daughter. She rules the majority of my life, outside
of my work time. Toddlers are a constant challenge and joy. Lucy
gives meaning to my life that will never be provided by my work.
<P>
I am also an avid outdoor person. Put me in site of fast moving
water or a quiet lakeand I will itch to get out on it in a canoe.
Give me a beautiful day and I will think only about bike riding
along a quiet road or a backwoods trail. Tell me I have a spare
hour in my day and I will put on my running shoes and breath deeply
the fresh air.  I may spend much of my time in the digital world,
but it will never be a substitute for the joys of the physical
nor should it ever interfere with our desire to fight for its
preservation.
<P>
Hope to meet you sometime,
<P>
Carl
