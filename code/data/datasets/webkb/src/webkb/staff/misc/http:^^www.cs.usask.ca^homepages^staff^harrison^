<p>
Thanks for stopping by my work-related web page.  The purpose of this page is
to give you a bit of background of what I do here at the University of Saskatchewan
Computer Science Department.

<p>

I'm a full-time Research Assistant for the <!WA3><a href=
"http://www.cs.usask.ca/projects/discus/discus.html">DISCUS</a> (DIStributed
Computing at the University of Saskatchewan) Research Group in the <!WA4><a
href="http://www.cs.usask.ca">Department of Computer Science</a>, at
the <!WA5><a href="http://www.usask.ca">University of Saskatchewan</a>.  The DISCUS
research group is primarily involved with studying operating system, network, and multiprocessor
performance evaluation through simulation, measurement traces of live systems,
and queueing theory.  My specialization is high-speed networking (particularly ATM), and I report primarily to <!WA6><a href="http://www.cs.usask.ca/homepages/faculty/carey">Carey Williamson.</a>
<p>
Presently, I'm involved with upgrading our research cluster network infrastructure
from ethernet to ATM over OC-3 fiber.  I'm also involved with the 
<!WA7><a href="http://www.wnet.ca/multicast/">Multicast Test Project</a> between several
Canadian universities.  The objective of the project is to evaluate the performance
and suitability of various videoconferencing software packages over Canada's
ATM research network.  I also manage the DISCUS research cluster which consists
of HP, Sun, and SGI workstations, as well as a Fore and a Newbridge ATM switch.

<p>

I have an M.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of 
Saskatchewan (1995), and a  B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering (1986), also from 
this university.

Here is where you can try out some of the web stuff I've been tinkering and experimenting with.  Items may include ja*a, cgi, perl, and maybe some web-based network management stuff (Note:  any network management stuff will *not* be connected to a live network - either it will run off canned traces or will have simulated output).  Try this stuff at your own risk.  This is definitely a place where crash helmets and fire suits should be used, as I am in the process of learning to use this stuff.  Keep checking back, I hope to add new things on a regular basis.  <!WA13><a href="http://www.cs.usask.ca/homepages/staff/harrison/testtrack.html">  Start your engines!</a>
