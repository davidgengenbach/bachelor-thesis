<h1 align=center> Welcome to Greg Oster's Home Page </H1> 

<p>

Welcome to my home page, a small contribution to the info-glut of
Cyberspace.  Feel free to wander about and try things.  If you
notice any organization to the contents of these pages, please inform
me so that I can correct the anomaly.

<p>

I work as a Research Assistant for the <a
http://www.cs.usask.ca/projects/discus>DISCUS</a> (DIStributed
Computing at the University of Saskatchewan) Research Group in the <!WA0><a
href="http://www.cs.usask.ca">Department of Computer Science</a>, at
the <!WA1><a href="http://www.usask.ca">University of Saskatchewan</a>.
Current projects include investigating the performance of <!WA2><a
href="http://www.osf.org/dce/index.html">OSF's DCE</a> (Distributed
Computing Environment) and adding a wireless connection to a laptop in
our DCE Cell.

<p>

I have recently become quite interested in mutual funds and other
sorts of investments (perhaps that has something to do with RRSP's and
Tax season...).  A few pointers to some mutual fund things and some
investment calculators can be found on my <!WA3><a
href="http://www.cs.usask.ca/homepages/staff/oster/finance.html">Financial</a> page.

<p>

<!WA4><a href="http://www.cs.usask.ca/homepages/staff/oster/netbsd.html">NetBSD</a> is my all-time favorite operating
system.  I run NetBSD on both my Amiga 3000 (called "gonzo"), and Sun
3/50 (called "fozzie").  


<p>
Other bits and pieces:
<ul>
<li>
Saskatoon has a Free-Net.  You can find it right here: <!WA5><a
href="http://www.sfn.saskatoon.sk.ca">Saskatoon Free-Net</a>.
<li>
The best WWW search engine (in my opinion) is <!WA6><a
href="http://www.altavista.digital.com">AltaVista</a>.  
<li>
Favorite Major League BaseBall team: <!WA7><a
href="http://www.bluejays.ca">The Toronto Blue Jays</a>
<li>
A personal peeve (or Stupid People Tricks): <!WA8><a
href="http://www.cs.usask.ca/homepages/staff/oster/gun_control.html">Canada's "new" Gun Control Laws</a> 
</ul>

<p>

<!WA9><a href="http://www.cs.usask.ca/homepages/staff/oster/construction.html"> Stuff under construction </a> is my HTML 3.0
playground.  Please don hard-hat before entering.

<hr>

Should you wish to send me encrypted email, here is my <!WA10><a
href="http://www.cs.usask.ca/homepages/staff/oster/public.key"> PGP Public Key </a>.  More information on PGP
(Pretty Good Privacy) can be found <!WA11><a
href="http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/warlord/pgp-faq.html">here</a>

<p>

These pages are best viewed under some version of <!WA12><a
href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Arena/">Arena</a>, Netscape, or
Mosaic.  (No, I won't tell you where to get Netscape or Mosaic from.
You can find that out by visiting just about any other page on the
Web...)  Since I don't have many graphics yet (if you search a bit,
you can find some :-) ) these pages should be also viewable under
Lynx.
