<em>Research Interests</em><br>
Linda Torczon is one of the principal investigators on the <!WA1><a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/MSCP/MSCP.html">Massively
Scalar Compiler Project</a> at Rice and the project director of an effort funded by the State of Texas to study compiler-based optimization of non-numerical code.
Her research interests include code generation and optimization, 
interprocedural data-flow analysis and optimization, and programming 
environments.  In the code generation and optimization realm, 
she has published a set of improvements to graph coloring register allocation. 
She is also one of the key implementors of an optimizing compiler for Fortran.
In the area of interprocedural analysis and optimization, she has developed techniques for 
interprocedural constant propagation and recompilation analysis.  She has also completed 
studies on the effectiveness of several interprocedural constant propagation techniques.
In the programming environment arena, she was one of the driving forces behind the ParaScope
programming environment project.  She was a principal architect of the framework for
whole program analysis in the ParaScope programming environment.
The current <!WA2><a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/fortran-tools/DSystem/DSystem.html">
D System</a> project is a descendant of the ParaScope programming
environment.<p>

<em>Related Publications</em><br>
Torczon has produced a number of <!WA3><a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/MSCP/publications.html">publications
related to the Massively Scalar Compiler Project</a>.

<em>Other Projects</em><br>
Linda Torczon is the Executive Director of the 
<!WA4><a href="http://www.crpc.rice.edu/CRPC/">Center for Research on 
Parallel Computation</a>, an NSF Science and Technology Center devoted
to making massively parallel computer systems usable---as usable as 
conventional supercomputer systems are today.
She is also involved in the 
<!WA5><a href="http://riceinfo.rice.edu/armadillo/Rice/Rice_home.html">The Rice School/La Escuela Rice,</a> a Rice-Houston Independent School District laboratory 
school for students from kindergarten through eighth grade.
