<H3> Biography: </H3> <P>
I am currently a visiting scholar at the
<!WA1><A HREF="http://www.cs.uiuc.edu">University of Illinois, Department of
Computer Science</A>. I'm working in the <!WA2><a href="http://biobio.cs.uiuc.edu/osl.html">Open
Systems Laboratory </a>. I came here from
<!WA3><a href="http://www.hitachi.co.jp/Lab/hrl.html">Hitachi Research
Laboratory</a>, <!WA4><A HREF="http://www.hitachi.co.jp">Hitachi, Ltd.</A>,
Japan. My main research topic now is distributed real-time systems.</P>

I received my BS in 1986 and MS in 1988 by
<!WA5><A HREF="http://www.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp">Information Science of the
Kyoto University</A>, Japan. The research I have done there was mainly
on compilers of the VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) computers.

After I joined Hitachi, Ltd., I have done the research on
multi-processor operating system, especially on memory management. I
have also done some work on dependable distributed systems.<P>

<H3>Miscellanious Stuff:</H3> <P>

My real name is Masahiko Saito. The easiest way to call me is to say
"Site Oh!" consecutively, which is the pronunciation of my last name.
(It may be difficult to pronounce my first name.)
You can also call me "miyabi" which is my nickname in Japan as well
as my user name. "Miyabi" is another pronunciation of one of chinese
characters of my name which is usually pronounced as "Masa."
It also has a meaning "of Kyoto," which is my home town.<P>

My hobby is <!WA7><a href="http://biobio.cs.uiuc.edu/~miyabi/picture/bike.jpg">mountain-biking</a>, going
to hot springs and going to see
<!WA8><a href="http://biobio.cs.uiuc.edu/~miyabi/picture/capilano.jpg">suspension bridges</a>. I love
mountain-biking most. But there is no mountain here in
Illinois.;-)<P>
