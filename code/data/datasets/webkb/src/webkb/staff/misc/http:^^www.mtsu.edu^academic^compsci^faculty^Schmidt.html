Hi there.  Sorry, every time they take a picture of me, I break the camera.  
It's too expensive to replace those cameras, so you'll just have to put up 
with the text.<p>
You can always reach me at one of the following: <p>
<ul>
<li><b><i><!WA0><A HREF="http://www.mtsu.edu/~ggjns">ggjns</i> @ mtsu.edu</A></b>
<li><b><i>root</i> @ knuth.mtsu.edu</b>
<li><b><i>postmaster</i> @ mtsu.edu</b>
</ul>
<p>
I'd like to hear from you if you have any questions or comments about the software, performance or accounts on MTSU systems.  Contact me at:
<ul>
<li>615-898-2129 (my desk)
<li>615-898-2397 (Computer Science office number)
<li>615-898-2144 (the Computer Science Lab number)
<li>615-898-5567 (our FAX number)
<li>615-252-5938 (my beeper number: wait briefly for 3 beeps, then enter the number you want me to see, press "#" and hang up)
</ul>
Oh, you might also want to come by and see me.  I'm in <b> Kirksey Old Main (KOM) </b> room <b> 351 </b> over by the elevator.
