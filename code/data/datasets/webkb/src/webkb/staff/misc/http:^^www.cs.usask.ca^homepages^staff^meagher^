<HR>
My current interests are: navigation, visualization, groupware, 
interface design, history of technology, and distributed cognition.    
If you can make any sense out of all this stuff, drop me a line.

I am currently working as a research associate on the Network Centre's of 
Excellence TeleLearning Project.  Our group at the University of 
Saskatchewan is developing software to support peer learning in the 
workplace.  Our testbed for this project is the Regional Psychiatric Centre 
(RPC) in Saskatoon.  RPC is a forensic mental health hospital serving the 
prairie region (i.e., Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta).  We are in the 
process of designing a peer-help system for the Offender Management System 
(OMS).  OMS is used to keep track of information on around 100,000 offenders 
across Canada.
