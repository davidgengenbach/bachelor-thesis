<h4>Webology</h4>
One of the main reasons for this page is that I'm taking a course
in "<!WA7><a href="http://gulf.uvic.ca/~csc586">Advanced Webology</a>"
and need to have a cyberspace playground. This is it.
<ul>
<li>You might want to check out the original (as far as I know)
<!WA8><a href="http://gulf.uvic.ca/~bmarykuc/cgi/count.cgi">Non-Sequential Counter</a>, another first
on the World Wide Web.<p>
<li>This image is a dull clickable map:

<!WA10><img align=middle src="http://gulf.uvic.ca/~bmarykuc/images/rgby.gif" ismap></a></p>
<li><b>Course Requirement:</b> I have a <!WA11><a href="http://gulf.uvic.ca/~bmarykuc/Hello.wav">boring audio message</a> here.
<li><b>Course Requirement:</b> I have a <!WA12><a href="http://gulf.uvic.ca/~bmarykuc/BinConv.html">silly Java applet</a> here.
<li>In keeping with my tradition of attempting way-too-ambitious projects,
here is my Webology term project on
<!WA13><a href="http://gulf.uvic.ca/~bmarykuc/project0.html">Java Agents</a>.<p>
</ul>

I think that <b>Java</b> is really cool. I just got "Roaster", which is
a Java development environment for Macintosh. I plan to write a
whole bunch of <!WA16><a href="http://gulf.uvic.ca/~bmarykuc/javastuff.html">Java applets</a> and post them here.

I do some consulting work for the
<!WA19><a href="http://iris.esg.cous.uvic.ca/">Apple Education Consultant
Program (AECP)</a>. If you are interested in using Macintosh in
education or for research, or have an interest in developing
Macintosh software, give us a call.
<p>We've planned a few events for this term:
<ul><li>Some time in
February (the 5th?), we'll be doing an
<!WA20><a href="http://www.opendoc.apple.com/">OpenDoc</a> hands-on
demonstration. OpenDoc's pretty cool. If you're interested,
check out Apple's <!WA21><a href="http://cdog.apple.com/">CyberDog</a>
Web site.
<li>Very soon, I'll be doing a seminar on 
<!WA22><a href="http://www.natural.com/pages/products/roaster/">Roaster</a>,
the Macintosh-hosted Java development kit.
</ul>
Please let me know if either of these interest you, or if you
have a particular topic that you'd like to see covered in an AECP
seminar.<p>

<h4>My Job</h4>
In real life, I'm the Manager of the Systems Group at Essential
Planning Systems, and I also write a lot of code. EPS develops 
and sells Geographic Information System software worldwide. EPS
doesn't have a Web page yet, which is too bad because that means
I can't put a link here. Our cousins at <!WA47><a href="http://www.pci.on.ca/">
PCI</a> have a page though.<p>
At the moment, I'm writing a file
access API for the Pamap GIS. The rest of our group is working
on providing massive user interface enhancements.<p>
