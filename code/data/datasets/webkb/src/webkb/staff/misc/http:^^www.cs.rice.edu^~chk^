<strong>Charles Koelbel </strong>, Research Scientist <br>
B.A. (1983), Augustana College <br>
M.S. (1985), Ph.D. (1990) Purdue University <P> 

Chuck Koelbel's research interests center on mapping algorithms and programs 
onto distributed memory multiprocessors. His doctoral dissertation presented a 
compiler which translated Kali, a shared-memory imperative language, for 
execution on the Intel iPSC/2. A unique feature of this work was a unified 
treatment of regular computations, for which the communications can be 
generated at compile time, and unstructured computations, for which run-time 
support is necessary. Both types of support are necessary for a truly general 
system. Since coming to Rice he has worked closely with K. Kennedy and others 
to apply his methods to the FORTRAN D compiler project. He is also studying new techniques for implementing adaptive and dynamically 
varying data structures on distributed memory machines. These data structures 
are needed in many areas, including sparse matrix calculations which have 
applications in finite element methods and linear programming. 

<P>In addition to 
his research responsibilities, Chuck Koelbel served in 1992 and 1993 as executive director 
of the High Performance FORTRAN Forum, a group of academic, industrial, and 
government organizations defining extensions to the FORTRAN language for use 
on scalable parallel machines. He continues to be active with that group.<HR>
