Hercules aka Dippus J. Cat aka Dippy Kitty is an 18 lb Domestic Shorthair
who is approximately 4-1/2 years old.  He is an obsessive fetcher - whenever
he hears the sound of a wounded piece of paper, he's there.  He could 
probably teach a Patriot missile a thing or two about target acquisition and
tracking.  He also enjoys 200MPH circuits around the duplex, and full-body
catrubs with full force, as well as the occasional shoulder perch.
He unfortunately Bogarts - when they have catnip, he positions his body
so as to block Ariel from getting to it.<BR>
<BR>
Ariel aka Bitchcat aka Felinoid Chest Tumor is Hercules' sister.  She weighs
12 lbs.  Other than lying on my lap/chest, she enjoys kneading at the base
of my neck.  She is also a shoulder kitty par excellence.  She guards the 
top of my monitor jealously - that is HER perch.  She will also fetch, with 
indifferent consistency.  She is in charge of killing bed mice as well.
She LOVES bread.<BR>
<BR>
They are both the sweetest kitties in the world, and of course adore me.
I have the marks of their claws and fangs to prove it.  They will growl at
intruders faithfully to protect me from harm.  Of course, there is a time 
limit at which time they head for the underside of the waterbed.  Darwinism
in action.  They purr at the drop of a hat, or Pounce, or whatever I'm 
eating.  They always have to at least smell what I'm eating, and will fight
the most vicious beasts of the Universe for Fig Newtons.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, they're not spoiled.<BR>
