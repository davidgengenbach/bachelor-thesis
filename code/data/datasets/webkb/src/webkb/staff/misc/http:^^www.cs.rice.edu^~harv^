<em>Background</em><br>

After receiving his Bacherlors' Degree in Computer Science from Rice
University in 1988, Tim Harvery went to PRC, a subcontractor to
NASA, where he worked as programmer and technical lead building some
of the support software on the Space Station Freedom project. <p>

In 1991, Tim came back to Rice to work on the Massively Scalar
Compiler project.  He helped design the ILOC language and implement
the parser and support routines (the <!WA1><a
href=ftp://cs.rice.edu/public/preston/optimizer/shared.ps.gz>shared
code</a>) which serve as a platform upon which all of the MSCP
optimization passes are written. <p>

After finishing the shared libraries, Tim has kept busy by writing an
implementation of Wegman and Zadeck's <em>Sparse Conditional Constant
Propagation</em> algorithm.  He also wrote an SSA-based peephole
optimization pass.  His <!WA2><a
href=ftp://cs.rice.edu/public/preston/optimizer>implementation</a>
of dominator calculation based on the algorithm by Cytron <em>et
al.</em> is available by ftp.  His <!WA3><a
href=ftp://cs.rice.edu/public/preston/optimizer>implementation</a> of a Static Single
Assignment form converter is also available. <p>


<em>Current Work</em><br>


Tim is currently working on a reimplementation/webification/augmentation of
Preston Briggs' register allocator.<p>

<em>Future work</em><br>

Tim is going to be looking at new implementations of register
allocators. <p>
