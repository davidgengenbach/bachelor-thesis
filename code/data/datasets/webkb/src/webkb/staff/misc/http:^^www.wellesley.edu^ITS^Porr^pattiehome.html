<H3>Professional Interests</H3><P>
My research and greatest professional interest is in Residential Computing and the
effect that this has on higher education. I participate in the <!WA12><A HREF="http://rescomp.stanford.edu/resnet96/">ResNet</A> program which
has been based at Stanford University.  ResNet 97 will be held
at Wellesley College June 21-25, 1997 and I will be serving as Chairwoman. Plan to join us....it will be GREAT!<P>

I enjoy surfing the Net and looking for 

<!WA13><A HREF="http://rescomp.stanford.edu/others.html">ResNet Resources at Other Academic Institutions</A>.<P>
I also participate actively in <!WA14><A HREF="http://www.sewanee.edu/OtherPlacesToGo/CLAC.html">CLAC</A> (Consortium of Liberal Arts Colleges).  I find that
getting to know technology/information professionals from other small liberal arts colleges.  I recently served as moderator for a
panel of student RCCs (Residential Computing Consultants) at the annual CLAC meeting.
As a result of that session, several CLAC members asked that I outline the basics of the
<!WA15><A HREF="http://www.wellesley.edu/ITS/Porr/rcc_training_outline.html">Residential Computing Consultant Training</A> here at Wellesley.<p>
