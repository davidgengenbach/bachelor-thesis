<h1> Computer Science Department.</h1><p>

<hr>
The Department of Computer Science offers a full range of courses designed 
to prepare students who plan to enter computing careers in business, 
government, education, and industry as well as those who plan to enter 
graduate school.  The Department emphasizes a blend of theory, abstraction,
and design needed to prepare students to meet their future goals.

<p>

Programs in the department lead to the Bachelor of Science degree with a 
major in Computer Science.  Students may select an emphasis in Business 
Applications. Only one minor is required for a Computer Science major.  The 
department cooperates with the Aerospace Department to offer the Airway 
Science curriculum approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.  In 
addition, a minor in Computer Science is offered.
