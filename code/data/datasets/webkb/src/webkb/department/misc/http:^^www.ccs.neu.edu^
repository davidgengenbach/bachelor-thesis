<DT><!WA17><A HREF="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/gradschool/">Graduate School</a>
<DD> The College of Computer Computer Science offers full-time and
     part-time programs leading to the M.S. in Computer Science and to
     the Ph.D.  It offers an exciting environment combining
     student-centered education and a cutting-edge research program.<P>

<DT> <!WA18><A HREF="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/gradschool/irm/">Graduate Certificate in Information
     Resources Management</A>
<DD> A graduate-level Certificate offered jointly with the College of
     Business Administration, consisting of a coherent set of six
     courses that cover both the technological and behavioral
     perspectives on computing systems and networks.  This program
     recognizes that, in addition to people capable of building
     systems, there is a need for people who understand the impact of
     computers on individuals, work groups and society, and who can
     contribute to the formation of policies for technology
     development and use.<P>

<DT> <!WA19><A HREF="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/">Research Interests</A>
<DD> The College of Computer Science has a wide diversity of research
     interest which we are actively pursuing.  We are proud to be on the
     cutting edge of many of the most interesting technologies.  Our
     growing national reputation is reflected in the substantial
     increases in external funding we have experienced in each of the
     last several years.<P>

<DT> <!WA20><A HREF="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/co-op/">Cooperative Education</A>
<DD> Northeastern University has an aggressive Cooperative Education program
     that provides an excellent real-world experience to its students.
     Here is some information on the Co-op program within the College
     of Computer Science.<P>

<DD>InfoCity is an undergraduate project designed to influence both
     the academic and social life of the <!WA24><A HREF="http://www.ccs.neu.edu//">College of Computer
     Science</A>. InfoCity focuses on making a text-based virtual reality
     of the college's workplace.  Students (both <!WA25><A

     administration</A> can cooperate in a multi-user, virtual environment.
     Our community can connect from their dorms, homes, or offices at any
     time of day or night. Ideally, this environment would provide many
     things such as advising tools, expansion of office hours to everyone's
     convenience, and a social climate for members to have informative
     exchanges of their expertise.
