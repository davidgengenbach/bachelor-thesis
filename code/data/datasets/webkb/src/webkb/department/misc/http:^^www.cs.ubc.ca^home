UBC Computer Science Home Page </H1>

This is the World Wide Web home page for the University of British Columbia
Computer Science Department.  The weary cyberspace traveller might like
to know that we're located in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
<P>
Since we were the first HTTP server in BC, you may have
come here expecting to find
the <!WA1><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/dept/ubc">University of British Columbia</A> or
the province of <!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/dept/bc">British Columbia</A>.
Fortunately, you <EM>can</EM>
get there from here.
<P>
Paths to all the nooks and crannies of this web can be found here.
They're broken down into major categories and presented in a narrative
style.  If that doesn't appeal to you, there's a
<!WA3><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/inmenu/top/-">menu-style list</A> of everything here.

<H2>Computer Science Department</H2>
You can read a little
<!WA4><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/dept/annual95/report.html">about the department</A> and
see the
<!WA5><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/userinfo/menu">people behind it</A> and
<!WA6><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/dept/userwebs">what they do</A>.

We also have information specifically for our
<!WA7><A HREF="http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca">undergraduate students</A> and for our

If you'd
like to apply for graduate school here,
we have some
<!WA24><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/dept/grad/application">application forms</A> available.
There are other
<!WA25><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/dept/online">forms for internal use</A>.



<H2>Using and Building the World Wide Web</H2>

For those of you just starting to use WWW, there are some
<!WA26><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/doc/browsing">hints on using your Web browser</A>.
After that you may want to
<!WA27><A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html"
>learn about HTML</A>, the lingua franca of the web.  Or you can just
jump right in and find out how to
<!WA28><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/dept/webdoc/spider">make your documents available to the world</A>.
There's a few other things our server allows like
<!WA29><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/dept/webdoc/userinfo">adding to your userinfo page</A>.
<P>
There are web browsers for the Macintosh and the PC.

Contact phillips@cs.ubc.ca if you'd like a copy.  They should really
be on-line somewhere.
You can even read about
<!WA30><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/spider/phillips/webserv">setting up your own HTTP server</A>,
but CS people probably don't need to go to the trouble.

<H2>Facilities</H2>

The department's computers consistly largely of UNIX workstations with some
Macintoshes and PCs lying around.  There's lots more to say about the
facilities, but no one has written something down to reference.  Some
system documentation like <!WA31><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/softcat">the software catalog</A>,
<!WA32><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/man">UNIX manual pages</A> and
<!WA33><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/doc/info.html/index.html">GNU texinfo</A> is on line.

<H2>Library</H2>

The department has its own
<!WA34><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/doc/reading-room">reading room</A>,
but you should take a look at the list of
<!WA35><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/doc/rr/trs.html">electronic jounals</A>
and other on-line information.  Besides all that, we've got the
meagre beginnings of a virtual library including such things as:
<P>
<UL>

<LI>Webster <!WA36><A HREF="http://webster1.cs.ubc.ca:2627/dict">dictionary</A>
	and <!WA37><A HREF="http://webster1.cs.ubc.ca:2627/thesaurus">thesaurus</A>.
<LI><!WA38><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/phonebook/ubc">UBC Phone Book</A>
<LI><!WA39><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/doc/ean">EAN mailer user manual</A>
<LI><!WA40><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/elements">Periodic table of the elements</A>
<LI><!WA41><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nhl">NHL 1994-1995 Hockey Schedules</A>
</UL>
<P>
The UBC library has its own telnet-based
<!WA42><A HREF="telnet://library.ubc.ca">card catalog</A> to which we've hacked
up a reasonably spiffy way of
<!WA43><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/library/due">finding what books you have due</A>.

<H2>Gateways and Special Services</H2>

We have some gateways to <!WA44><A HREF="http://web.cs.ubc.ca/grn/newsgroups">USENET news</A>
and <!WA45><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/ftp">anonymous FTP</A> that are must sees.  The first
is a multi-part article decoding service -- it tramps through various
newsgroups hourly; finds multi-part or encoded articles like images,
sounds, shar files and the like; and assembles them into an easy to
view and easy to download form.  The second is a gateway to our
<!WA46><A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.ubc.ca/">anonymous FTP archives at ftp.cs.ubc.ca</A>
and features the ability to browse straight into zip files without
having to load them entirely over to your site.
<P>
The <!WA47><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/opengov">open government mirror</A> is a copy of the
web created by Industry Canada to explain some of the whos and hows
of Canadian government.
<P>
And then there's <!WA48><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/spock">Mr. Spock quotes</A>.

<H2>This Web Server</H2>

A few documents here refer specifically to this server.  Some
<!WA49><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/doc/stat/all.day">daily and hourly usage statistics</A>
are available along with a list of <!WA50><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/doc/world/history">what's
new</A> here.

<H2>UBC, BC and the World</H2>

If you're looking for UBC related information, starting with our
list of <!WA51><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/doc/ubc-infoserv">UBC information servers</A>
may help.  Our teeny <!WA52><A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/dept/bc">British Columbia</A>
page will guide you to many other web servers in province.
<P>
Looking for something but don't know where to start?
Two suggestions come to mind.
First is the
<!WA53><A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/MetaIndex.html"
>Internet Resources Meta-Index</A> which has a bunch of
possible starting points mostly consisting of searchs and
some subject indicies.  Second is the collection of
<!WA54><A HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/FAQ-List.html"
>USENET FAQs</A>.  It's essentially the collected wisdom of many
USENET groups whose topics are quite diverse.  It's much more useful
than it sounds.
