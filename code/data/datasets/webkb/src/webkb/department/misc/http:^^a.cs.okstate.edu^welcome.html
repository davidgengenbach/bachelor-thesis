There are also students enrolled in the Telecommunications Management 
Masters Degree.  There are 16 enrolled in the Computer Science area.
<p>
The number of students who graduated from the Computer Science Department
for the 1995-1996 year are:
<pre>
       Undergraduates:  29
       Masters:         21
       Ph.Ds:            3

The department not only delivers three degree programs  on campus in Stillwater, but it  has a Master's program at University Center at Tulsa.  Some of the courses are taught by faculty in Tulsa but other  courses are offered by compressed video to Tulsa and to four other sites located at companies in Oklahoma.  With the start of <!WA4><a href="http://www.onenet.net/">OneNet</a> in
the state of Oklahoma, the program will expand. <p>

Computer Science has also been offering a course for <b>NTU</B>(National Technological University) for five years.  This course has students enrolled throughout the United States.<p>

The department also plays a significant role in the Master of Science in Telecommunication Management program.  This is a program that combines courses from the Business College, Engineering College and the Arts and Sciences College. <p>

The department has seminars of interest at various times during the semester.
These include both internal speakers and external speakers.  The seminar
series is organized and managed by the Public Relations Committee with
assistance of the local chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery.
Usually there is one seminar a month.  Check out the list of Seminars listed
in the Departmental Information area.
