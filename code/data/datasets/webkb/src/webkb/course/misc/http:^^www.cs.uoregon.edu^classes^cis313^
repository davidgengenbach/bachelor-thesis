<p><li><b>Evaluation:</b> 
<UL>
<LI> There will be four or five written assignments
and three programming assignments.  These are to be done individually
rather than in groups.  
<LI> The midterm was held on Nov. 8.  Check out the
<!WA9><A HREF="http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/classes/cis313/midtopics.html">study guide</A> (html) and the 
<!WA10><A HREF="http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/classes/cis313/midterm.ps">sample solution</A> (postscript only).
<LI> The final will be held on Thursday, Dec. 12
at 10:15 (it's a two hour exam).
<LI>  The final will <B>not be in the regular classroom.</B>  It will
be held in <B>room 238</B>, down the hall.

</table><P>

<P><LI><B>Late policy:</B>  All assignments are due by 5:00pm of the
stated due date, though it is much safer to turn them in at class time.
Late papers are subject to a 5% per day penalty, up to a maximum
of 25%.  Late assignments will not be accepted once the graded
papers are returned or once sample are handed out.

<P><LI><B>Programming:</b> should be done in C++. The programs have
to be accompanied by a manual-like documentation page, analysis of
program correctness and complexity, and evidence of experimentation
that includes sample runs. Documentation should include both in-code
and general comments. Legibility of the code is essential. The
official center for computing activity is the Computing Room 100 in
Deschutes Hall.  Of course, if you have C++ available elsewhere,
such as at home, you are welcome to use it.  Due to the variety
of platforms used, you should turn in hardcopy.

<P><LI><b>Grading:</b> will be performed by an able and experienced
grader. Any contested score will be first referred to that person. Be
aware of the possibility of correcting grading mistakes both in your
favor and disadvantage, so that the challenged score can change in
either direction. <B> Note:</b> to allow for a larger margin
of subjectivity in grading, we will use the whole score range, from 0
to 100%; you may expect the average score (corresponding to B-) to be
around 50%. The final letter grade will be assigned based on the
total weighted score curve.
