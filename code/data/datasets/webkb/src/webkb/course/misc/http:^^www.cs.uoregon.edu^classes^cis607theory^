<H1>CIS 607, Fall 1996</H1>
<I>Quantum Computing Seminar</I>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P>
The purpose of this page is to provide some web links relevant to the
seminar on quantum computing.

<HR>

<P> In the directory /cs/classes/cis607theory/papers/ you can find
downloaded copies of some relevant papers.  Admittedly, this is of
no help for those of you on machines outside the CIS department.

If you have downloaded a potentially interesting paper, feel free
to move or copy it to that directory (and amend the README file
appropriately).  This can help avoid saving multiple copies of
these files.

<HR>

<P> The followng links were provided by Bill Kantor:

for SHOR'S factoring algorithm presented perhaps more slowly.
This all would need to be printed out, I suppose.  But it starts out assuming you know what 
 dopant impurities 
are??

tooooo much stuff
and seems to require SOMEONE whol knows some physics just to
translate the lingo.

<HR>

<P>
There is also a 
<!WA6><A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/explorations/091696explorations.html">
Scientific American article</A>
which itself is short but has some interesting looking links
(which are likely duplicated above).
<P>
Here is a link to the

Measurement in quantum mechanics FAQ</A>.

<P>
Charlie Wright mentions, concerning a tutorial available from a site
in Israel:
<P>
The tutorial looks eminently readable to me, and not as frighteningly
technical as it might at first appear. [Ignore the stuff about doping.]
<P>
It takes FOREVER to download it from Israel, but it's quite fast to get
from
