<h2> Background </h2>

This seminar will introduce students to an exciting area of research
that draws upon results from operations research (Markov decision
processes), machine learning (reinforcement learning), and traditional
AI (planning) to attack problems with great scientific and commercial
potential.  We will read and discuss a handful of recent papers that
will give students an appreciation for the state of the art.  Students
will undertake a group research project to solidify their
understanding of the basic concepts and perhaps to contribute to the
field. <p>

I will make a number of presentations to introduce students to the
background material necessary to read the research papers---only
undergraduate-level computer science knowledge and basic probability
theory and calculus will be assumed.  I think there are useful
contributions to be made by researchers in AI, algorithms, complexity,
numerical methods, and systems, and I think people in all these areas
would find some useful information in the seminar.  Everyone's welcome!

<h3> Description </h3>

Research in planning, making a sequence of choices to achieve some
goal, has been a mainstay of artificial intelligence (AI) for many
years.  Traditionally, the decision-making models that have been
studied admit no uncertainty whatsoever---every aspect of the world
that is relevant to the generation and execution of a plan is known in
advance.  In contrast, work in operations research (OR) has focussed
on the uncertainty of actions but uses an impoverished representation
for specifying planning problems.  <p>

The purpose of this seminar is to explore some middle ground between
these two well-studied extremes with the hope of understanding how we
might create systems that can reason efficiently about plans in
complex, uncertain worlds.  We will review the foundational results
from AI and OR and read a series of papers written over the last few
years that have begun to bridge the gap.


<h3>Philosophy</h3>

There are basically two or three papers on different approaches to the
same basic problem that I'd like people to read and understand.  These
papers are quite recent and represent active areas of research that
have been maturing quite quickly over the last few years.  As a
result, to get a deep appreciation for this work, we will need to read
a number of papers that introduce the necessary background. <p>

My approach to organizing the seminar will be to try to keep the
assigned reading to a minimum and to ask students to concentrate on
understanding the state of the field and on identifying the important
open research questions.


<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

The seminar should be accessible to any advanced computer science
student.  My goal is to introduce critical background material as the
need arises. <p>

Nonetheless, we need some common ground to begin.  I will assume that
students are familiar with programming (any language), algorithm
analysis (big O notation), calculus (derivates of multivariate
functions), and probability theory (conditional probabilities).

<h3>Postrequisites</h3>

In addition to exploring the question of how to create plans that are
effective in uncertain environments, there are a number of other
important topics that students will learn about in this seminar:
students will be exposed to Markov decision processes, dynamic
programming, linear programming, temporal difference learning,
supervised function approximation, gradient descent and neural
networks, STRIPS rules, and partial order planning.

<h3>Organization Meeting</h3>

On Thursday, September 5th (D344, 2:30-3:00), we'll get together to
discuss the best time to schedule the class.  If you can't make the
meeting, please send me email (<!WA9><a
href="mailto:mlittman@cs.duke.edu">mlittman@cs.duke.edu</a>).


<h3>Introduction</h3>

What is planning?  What is uncertainty?  What are some applications of
planning under uncertainty?  I'll lay out the space of issues and
describe the part of the space we'll explore. <p>

<h3>Markov Decision Processes</h3>

I'll introduce the MDP model, which is a formal specification for the
particular problem we will be examining.  I'll describe the
fundamental concepts (states, actions, transitions, rewards,
discounting, horizons), results (existence and dominance of optimal
value function, optimal greedy policies), and the algorithms (value
iteration, policy iteration, modified policy iteration, linear
programming). <p>

In a sense, these algorithms completely solve the problem of planning
under uncertainty.  The rest of the seminar is concerned with solving
MDPs more efficiently by exploiting additional structure present in
some instances. <p>

<h3>Accelerating Solutions to MDPs</h3>

One class of algorithms for solving MDPs more quickly restricts
value-iteration updates to states that are likely to benefit from
additional computational resources. <p>

Prioritized Sweeping uses a heuristic for measuring when updating the
value of a state is likely to be important for computing an
approximately optimal solution quickly. <p>

postscript</a>) <p>

Real-time dynamic programming attempts to find a good approximate
policy quickly by focussing updates on states that are likely to be
visited.  <p>

postscript</a>) <p>

Another approach is to explicitly produce a good partial policy by
identifying states that are likely to be visited and solving a smaller
MDP. <p>

<h3>Value Function Approximation</h3>

The above approaches represent states as being completely unrelated
objects.  In many domains, states can be described in such a way that
similar states (from a policy or value standpoint) have similar
representations.  For example, any attempt to create a transition
function for the game of backgammon would likely make use of a
board-based representation of states. <p>

This insight can be exploited by exchanging the classical table-based
method for representating value functions to one that uses a function
approximator (for example, a neural net) to map state description
vectors to values.  A wildly successful example of this is TD-Gammon;
this work makes use of several important background ideas including
gradient descent and temporal difference learning that we will need to
look at as well.  <p>

applied to MDP-like problems is Crites and Barto's elevator

An even simpler and similarly successful example for cellular phone
channel assignments is based on TD(0) and a linear function
approximator. <p>

Tesauro's work is difficult to generalize because it simultaneously
addresses many unsolved problems.  More recent work has begun to tease
apart the effect of using function approximation in dynamic
programming from the use of the temporal difference algorithm. <p>

<h3>Stochastic Planning</h3>

The work on function approximation attempts to exploit structure in
the state space but treats actions as black box tranformations from
states to distributions over states.  A promising alternative is to
use symbolic descriptions of the actions to reason about entire
classes of state-to-state transitions all at once.  This is the
approach taken in AI planning. <p>

In the last two years, planning algorithms have been proposed that
differ substantially from the classic planners.  Although
unconventional, these planners have been shown empirically to result
in much shorter running times (up to several orders of magnitude
faster).  Blum and Furst's algorithm views planning as a type of graph
search while Kautz and Selman reduce planning to a boolean
satisfiability problem. <p>

In spite of recent algorithmic advances, the traditional view of
planning ignores uncertainty.  Uncertainty can be introduced gently by
assuming a deterministic domain with some randomness added in. <p>

The Buridan system introduces a more general representation for
stochastic STRIPS operators and extends partial order planning to
stochastic domains.  Its representation is equivalent in
expressiveness to MDPs. <p>

An area of intense interest (but remarkably little work!) is combining
direct manipulation of STRIPS-type actions with a
dynamic-programming-based algorithm.  Several papers adopt the view
that function approximation is a form of ``abstraction,'' the form of
which can be derived automatically from a propositional representation
of the planning problem. <p>

Next we'll deal with partially observable Markov decision processes
and how to solve them.

<h3>Advanced Topics</h3>

If we make unexpectedly fast progress through the core topics, there
are a number of interesting issues we could explore including:
hierarchical solutions to MDPs, partially observable MDPs, solving
games. <p>

Here are some papers I've recently found that might be useful to
discuss.  The first gives a notation for representing multi-player
games of incomplete information that might be useful in defining a
similar notation for MDPs.  The second describes how to solve very
large (and even continuous state) MDPs efficiently using linear
programming. <p>

<h2> <A NAME="projects"><!WA73><img src="http://www.cs.duke.edu/~mlittman/courses/cps370/bulb-t.gif">Project Ideas<A> </h2>

The major thrust of the seminar will be to undertake a group project
exploring some facet of the problem of planning under uncertainty.
Some sample project ideas are:

<UL>
<LI> Are there methods of efficiently evaluating plans in complex
domains?
<LI> Do MDP aggregation methods have anything to offer?
<LI> Can hierarchical methods be applied to propositional state
spaces? 
<LI> Can Blum and Furst's <!WA74><a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/Web/People/avrim/graphplan.html">Graphplan</a>
algorithm be extended to stochastic domains?
<LI> How do the known results concerning the use of function
approximation in dynamic programming relate to one another?
<LI> How does Boutilier and Dearden's structured policy iteration
algorithm perform on some simple structured MDPs?
</UL>

We're starting to make some progress on a domain for later project
development.  Stephen Majercik has written up his ideas on a load
balancing MDP, which are accessible from his <!WA75><a
href="http://www.cs.duke.edu:80/~majercik/HomePage.html">home
page</a>. <p>

We've talked about using the <!WA76><a
href="http://robotics.Stanford.EDU/~koller/gala.html">GALA</a> system
as a basis for a general declarative language for specifying MDPs.
Another options is a <!WA77><a
href="http://envy.cs.umass.edu/People/sutton/RLinterface/RLinterface.html">standard</a>
proposed by Rich Sutton.
