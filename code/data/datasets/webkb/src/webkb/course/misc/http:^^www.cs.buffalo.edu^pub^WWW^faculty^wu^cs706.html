<H2>Course Description</H2>
<UL>
Multimedia systems are characterized by use of several different methods
of presenting data, such as voice, motion video, music, and text.
A conference call between several parties that use both voice and video,
and a playback of a recorded conversation are two examples of multimedia
applications.  Each type of multimedia data has different properties.
For example, the bandwidth required for CD quality audio is very different
from that required for full motion video, which is different from that
of plain text.  However, a property common to all of these data types is
that they are all real-time in nature.  The applications send stream of
data that must be used within a time interval because the data is useless
after that interval.  Optimal scheduling of real-time tasks on distributed
and multiprocessor systems is an essential issue for multimedia applications.
<BR>
<BR>
The objective of this seminar is to study the basic properties and
techniques for real-time system support for multimedia application.
We will study and present research papers in this area.  Topics
include real-time scheduling, causal message ordering, multiprocessor
real-time systems, etc.
