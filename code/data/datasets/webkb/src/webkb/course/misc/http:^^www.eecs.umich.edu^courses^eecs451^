<P>
Remember, the group projects will count for 15% of your grade and will be
due on December 13th.
<P>
For those of you doing data analysis on a PC, I suggest you consider
using the <!WA13><A HREF="http://web.cs.mun.ca/~chris3/goldwave/goldwave.html">
GoldWave Digital Audio Editor</A>. This is a shareware package that
can be found on the CAEN Pentium machines in the Media Union. The program
is located on the S: drive in the \BIN\GOLDWAVE directory.
<P>
GoldWave does not replace MATLAB for doing
Fourier analysis, filtering, LPC modelling, etc. but it is a good
tool for manipulation of audio at the sample level and performing
simple transformations such as volume adjustments. Most importantly,
GoldWave is an excellent tool for performing conversions between
audio formats and extracting short segments of your waveforms for input
to MATLAB. GoldWave will, for example, convert WAV files to/from MATLAB
format.
<P>
If you'd like some data to play with, and don't have any of your own
yet, here are 2 sample files that you can use. They are recordings
of Prof. Wakefield's voice pronouncing 5 vowels, as heard in class.
Use your browser's "Save Link As..." feature to save these to a file
in your account (Shift-Left-Click instead of just Left-Click if you
are using Netscape).
<P>
<B>NOTE: </B> these sounds are currently corrupted due to a bad file
transfer. I will have fixed versions of these sounds available ASAP.
<P>
<UL>
<P><LI>
The <!WA14><A HREF="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs451/gwvowel.raw">gwvowel.raw</A> file is in raw (i.e.,
headerless) 16-bit, signed, monophonic format. This file was created
on a PC so it is in little-endian format (meaning the least significant
8 bits of each 16-bit sample comes first in the file). 
<P><LI>If you want to do
your experiments on a big-endian machine (such as a Sun or HP), you should use
this file, <!WA15><A HREF="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs451/gwbsw.raw">gwbsw.raw</A>, which is the same data
but it has already been byte-swapped for you. If you use the wrong
file, there'll be no doubt about it when you play it over speakers or
headphones.

<A NAME="Code">
<H1><B>MATLAB Code</B></H1></A>
<P>
Here is some MATLAB code that may be of use
or of interest. You can get the code by clicking on each link,
copying the code, and pasting it into an editor window. Easier is to
use your browser's "Save Link As..." function to save the code to a file.
Using Netscape on a Unix workstation, Right-Click on the link and
select "Save Link As..." or Shift-Left-Click to achieve the same thing.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+2>PLEASE DO NOT PRINT OUT THIS CODE</FONT></B>. Remember
how uptight CAEN is about printing things out. Too many people printing
off copies of the same file will lead to all of these files being
removed.

<!WA30><IMG SRC="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs451/small-brain.gif" ALIGN=Middle></H1>

Here is a compendium of the "brain teaser du jour" questions that have
been sent out on the mailing list. Someone suggested they might make
good review questions or study aids (or even Quals questions, nudge nudge,
wink wink, say no more).

<UL>
<P>
<LI><!WA31><IMG SRC="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs451/new.gif" BORDER=0>
  Consider the analog unit step signal u(t)=1, t&gt;=0, u(t)=0, t&lt;0. Is there
  any sampling frequency we can use to sample u(t) so that the resulting
  digital signal, u(n), exhibits no frequency-domain aliasing?
<P>
  Realizing that the answer to the above question is "no", now consider
  the sampled signal u(n).  What does this signal look like, for *any*
  sampling rate? How can this be explained?
</LI>

<P>
<LI>
Show that an FIR system may be written as an IIR system with an
infinite number of poles.
</LI>

<P>
<LI>
Show that an antisymmetric impulse response (i.e., h(n) = -h(-n)) has
a zero in its frequency response at omega=pi (and, of course, omega=-pi).
</LI>

<P>
<LI>
Consider the discrete-time signal:
<P><CODE><PRE>
        x(n) = cos(2*pi*f*n) for n in the range [0,15]
</PRE></CODE>
<P>
and the frequency 'f' is 5/16. What is the 16-point DFT of this signal? Now
define the signal:
<P><CODE><PRE>
        y(n) = x(n), n in the range [0,15]
             = 0, n in the range [16,31]
</PRE></CODE>
<P>
What is the 32-point DFT of this signal? It is possible to answer all
of the above questions without a computer and without doing any math.
<P>
Having done so, repeat this exercise using MATLAB. Display the magnitude
of your DFT's on a logarithmic scale to see the difference between theory
and reality. Also, do it again using f=5.5/16. Think about what you'd
expect to see both for the 16-point DFT and the 32-point DFT.
</LI>

<P>
<LI>
Let {bk} be one set of basis vectors for N-point sequences. Let {vk}
be another set of basis vectors for the same space. Find the "change of 
basis" transformation.  That is, find a matrix T such that:
<PRE>
                            h
                       y = T x
</PRE>
<P>
transforms the vector of expansion coefficients x (expanded on the {bk}
vectors) to the vector of expansion coefficients y (expanded on the {vk}
vectors). As its name implies, this transformation maps a data vector
from one basis to another. Both x and y represent the same data vector,
but written in terms of different bases.
<P>
What's the change of basis transformation for mapping a Fourier expansion
onto a Hadamard expansion?
</LI>

<P>
<LI>
Consider the continuous function:
<CENTER><PRE>
f(w) = exp(-jw(N-1)/2)*sin(wN/2)/sin(w/2)
</PRE>
</CENTER>
<P>
where 'w' is a real-valued continuous variable, N is a positive integer (N>1),
'j' is the square root of -1, and exp() is the standard exponential
function (i.e., "e to the power of...").
<P> 
Compute the N-point circular convolution of f(w) with itself: f(w) ** f(w)
where '**' indicates circular convolution. NOTE: If you can do this problem
IN YOUR HEAD without doing ANY MATH, then you are in great shape (mentally
speaking, of course).
</LI>

<P>
<LI>
Consider two NxN circulant matrices A and B (see page 4 of Lecture 20
for an example of a circulant matrix).
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Show that AB (this is matrix multiplication) is also a circulant
matrix.
<LI>Show that AB=BA. Is this true in general (i.e., for ANY matrix)?
<LI>Why are the above properties important when considering which
matrices can represent linear circularly-shift-invariant operators?
<LI>Prove that circular convolution is commutative (HINT: you've already
done it).
</OL>
</LI>

<P>

<!WA32><A HREF="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs451/brain.html">Brain teasers from the first third of the course</A>
have been placed on a separate page.

<P>
So where are the answers? Come to <!WA33><A HREF="#Office">office hours</A>!

<P>
Want more? Tell me and I'll try to think of some.

The two recitation sections will be identical so please come to only

that is hard to do if everyone comes to the same recitation.
<P>
GGB 1371 is hard to find. It is in the north-east section of G.G. Brown,
in that heavy machinery area where they build the concrete canoe, etc.
If you're coming to Thursday's recitation, plan on a few extra minutes
for finding the room. Use the building maps posted on the walls. 
Bring your hard-hat.
