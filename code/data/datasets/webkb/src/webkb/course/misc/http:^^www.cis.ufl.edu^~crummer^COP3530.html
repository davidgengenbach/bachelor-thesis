<H2>Data Structures and Algorithms COP 3530, Spring 1996,   Dr. Crummer</H2>

<PRE>This core course in computer science has prerequisites CIS3020 (Intro to
Computer Science) and CDA3101 (Intro to Computer Organization) and is
described in the official U.F. catalog. The following information is my
description in finer detail of how I plan to conduct the course.

<li> <B>TEXT</B>: Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with C++,
           (Walls And Mirrors), by Frank Carrano, 1995
           Practice exercises will be assigned but not collected. 
           These are listed below.

<li><B>UNDERGRADUATE CONSULTANT:</B> 
Michael Mark, <mpm@cis.ufl.edu> is a consultant on duty for this course.
He holds consulting hours in the "fishbowl" area on the 2nd floor of CSE
near the CIRCA labs (just to the left as you enter the lab) with this current
schedule. Here are the current hours:

WEEK AFTER SPRING BREAK:
Mar 18- Mar 21 :  <to be updated periodically>
==============
        Monday 6 - 8pm	         
	Tueday 6 - 7pm
	Wednesday 5 - 8pm
	Thursday  6 - 10pm

<li><B>DISCUSSION SECTIONS:</B>
Based on the section number you registered for, you will attend one
discussion section per week. In that discussion section, you will
1) take occasional quizzes (announced or not), 
2) receive instruction on C++ implementation details of the 
   abstractions you are learning, and 
3) get instructions and guidance on the assigned personal and
   homework projects which you will submit on-line.

<li><B>COMPUTER LANGUAGE: C++</B>
We will use C++ in the lectures, discussion sections and all homeworks.
No prior knowledge of C or C++ is assumed, but you must have the course
prerequisites including experience in one or more high level languages.
You will using Borlands Turbo C++ on any CIRCA machines on campus.

<li><B>HOMEWORK SUBMISSION:</B> 
The electronic submission of homeworks requires that you have a "grove"
account. This process is explained in an evening hands-on session the first
week of class (sign-up in the first lecture).

EARLY HW: 
If you submit a homework early and then improve upon it, you may resubmit. The
last version submitted before the deadline will be used for grading.

LATE HW: 
Homework may be submitted late if there has not been a solution given out or
discussed in class. The penalty is 15% for each 24 hours or fraction thereof.
