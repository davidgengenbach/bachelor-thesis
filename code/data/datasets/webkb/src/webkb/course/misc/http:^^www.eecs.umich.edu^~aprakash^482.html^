EECS 482 is an introductory course in operating systems at senior
undergraduate level or first-year graduate level. 
The objective of the course is to familiarize you with 
the issues involved in the design and implementation
of modern operating systems. The concepts discussed are
applicable to a variety of systems. However, we will discuss many
examples that are drawn from historically significant and modern
operating systems including Multics, UNIX, Mach, and Windows NT.

<P>

Topics to be discussed include processes and threads, interprocess
communication,  concurrency and synchronization, deadlocks
communication in distributed systems including remote procedure
calls. CPU scheduling, virtual memory management, input-output systems, 
disk scheduling, file systems, and protection and security.

<P>

Students are expected to have extensive programming experience prior
to this course. Knowledge of the C/C++ programming language and
familiarity with Unix is required.

Prerequisites </B> <BR>  
<P>
Computer Organization (EECS 370) 
and Data Structures (EECS 380) are essential.

<P>
<B> Class Textbook </B> <BR>
<P>
<li> Operating System Concepts, 4th Edition by Silberchatz and Glavin,
Addison-Wesley.

<li> Supplemental reading material and notes provided during the semester.
<P>
<B> Other Suggested Textbooks </B> <BR>
<P>
<li> Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment by Stevens, Addison-Wesley
<li> Modern Operating Systems by Tanenbaum, Prentice-Hall
<P>


<B>Assignments<BR>
</B>
<P>
You will complete four programming projects, working individually or
in groups of two (your decision), relating to the implementation of
operating systems. All the programming will be in the C or C++
programming language. You should be prepared to spend substantial
amount of time on the readings and on programming projects.
<P>
There will also be several homework assignments, to be done individually.
<P>
<B>Grading</B> <BR>
<P>

Grades will be based on two exams, four programming assignments, and
several homeworks according to the following tentative weightage:
<P>

<li>	Homeworks: 15% 
<li>	Midterm: 20% 
<li>	Final:	 25% 
<li>	Four programming projects: 40%

<P>
From my experience in teaching software courses in the past, most
people do very well on programming projects. So, exams and homeworks
end up being the distinguishing factors that determine the grade for
most students.  On the other hand, doing poorly on the programming
projects is a sure way to fail the course.
<P>

Also, note that your grade is only determining your performance during
the term. It is not determining your future potential, how well you
will be able to apply the course in your employment, etc.  And, in the
end, how well you do in the future is what really matters.  So, it is
important to not lose sight of the bigger picture beyond
grades. Instead, simply focus on doing the course to the best of your
potential and making sure to take advantage of TAs any myself to learn
the material. Many employers treat the knowledge of the material in
the course as being a true test of an experienced software practioner!
<P>
<B> Policy on Collaboration<BR>
</B>
<P>
Unethical behavior such as copying/modifying someone else's project
assignment code, looking into other students' directories for material
when they do not expect you to, copying homeworks, etc., is not
permissible.
<P>

On the other hand, you are encouraged to discuss homework problems and
project assignments with each other. That fosters learning and most of
the work in computer industry is done as a team effort. In such a
case, please write the names of the students you discussed homeworks
or projects on your submissions. However, note that the homework
solutions or actual code must not be shared. Homeworks must be written
individually and any code submitted must be yours (unless instructor's
permission is taken and the source acknowledged).
<P>
<B> Class Communication Tools </B>
<P>
We will use a variety of mechanisms to communicate within the
class. Most will have links from the 
 <!WA7><a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~aprakash/482.html"> 
EECS 482 home page </a> at
http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~aprakash/482.html. Tools will
include class newsgroup, an experimental Java-based chat facility, 
and of course email. Also, we will attempt to provide
most of the handouts on-line.
