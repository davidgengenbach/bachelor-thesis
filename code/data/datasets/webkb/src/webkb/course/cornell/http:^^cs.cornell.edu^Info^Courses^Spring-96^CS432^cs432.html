<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p>This <b>three credit</b> course covers the fundamentals of database
systems and information retrieval. The course will be (roughly) two
thirds databases and one third information retrieval.

<p>Topics to be covered in database systems
include the following: data modeling, entity-relationship model,
relational model, physical organization, indexing and hashing,
relational database design, database query languages, query
optimization, crash recovery, concurrency control, and transaction
processing.

<p>The information retrieval part deals with how to find useful
information in large textual databases. This part of the course will
cover inverted file systems, the vector space model (the SMART
system), vector similarity, indexing, weighting, ranking, relevance
feedback, phrase generation, term relationships and thesaurus
construction, retrieval evaluation, and (if time permits) automatic
text structuring and summarization.

<h2>
Grading
</h2>

<b>Exams</b>: There will be <b>two midterms, each worth 20%</b> of
your final grade and <b>a final</b> exam, <b>worth 35%</b> of your
final grade.<p>

<b>Homeworks</b>: There will be <b>five homeworks</b> in the semester,
<b>each worth 5%</b> of your final grade.<p>

<h2>
<a name=1>Homework Policies</a>
</h2>
<ol>
<li>You can work in groups of <b>up to 3</b> people on a homework.
<li>If you work in a group, clearly indicate the names of all the
group members on each homework. The entire group will receive the same
grade.
<li>Homeworks will be available on the CS-432 home page on a Tuesday
and will be due <b>in class</b> on Thursday of the following week.
<li>A solution set (along with a grading guide) will be available (of
course after the due date <!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><img align=top src="http://cs.cornell.edu/Info/Courses/Spring-96/CS432/smiley.gif">) through
the course home page.
<li><b>No late homeworks will be accepted.</b> 
<li>Illegible homeworks are hard for your TAs to grade. Even though it
is not required, you are encouraged to type your homeworks. Use LaTeX
if possible, if you don't already know it, this will be a good
opportunity for you to learn LaTeX.
</ol>

<h3>
Homework Submission
</h3>
Please attach a <b>cover page</b> to your homeworks with names of all the
group members (sorted alphabetically by the last name). Also write
"CS-432 Homework-X" on the cover page.
<dl>
<dt>For Example:<p>
<dd> Bill Clinton
<dd> Bob Dole
<dd> Ross Perot<p>
<dd> CS-432 Homework-2
</dl>

<h3>
Graded Homeworks
</h3>
Graded homeworks will be returned <b>in class</b>, sorted
alphabetically by the last name of the first group member (from the
cover page). The grade will be listed on the first page
<b>following</b> the cover page.<p>

<b>If you do not want your homeworks returned in this way, please send
mail to the instructor.</b>

<h3>
Regrade Policy
</h3>
All regrade requests should be submitted to the instructor <b>in
writing within a week</b> after you get back your graded homeworks.
