frequently for updates.
<P>
This course may take more work than you are expecting, depending on how
well prepared you are.
In any event, this course can become extremely difficult if you get behind.
Due to the grading procedures, it is very risky to wait until near a deadline
to take a quiz or turn in a program.
A late quiz or program gets only <b>HALF</b> credit!
Waiting lines can become very long, hours before a deadline.
You have been warned.

<p>Unfortunately, this Web Page is under construction this semester.
Many of the links go nowhere.
Our apologies.
