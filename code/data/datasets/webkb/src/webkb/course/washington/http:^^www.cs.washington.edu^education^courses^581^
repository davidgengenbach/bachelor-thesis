<h2>Finding term project topics</h2>

During the week of October 12-18 students should be actively
exploring one or more topics for the term project.
Written descriptions of topics should be handed in
on Tuesday, October 24.  A template for the writeups
is available 
<!WA1><!WA1><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/581/topic-template.txt">here.</a>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<!WA2><!WA2><a href="http://www.epm.ornl.gov/pvm/pvm_home.html">PVM (Parallel Virtual
Machine)</a> is a software layear that permits a user program to run on a
virual machine made up of a heterogeneous collection of  one or more
workstations.  This is a convenient way to implement and study
distributed algorithms.
