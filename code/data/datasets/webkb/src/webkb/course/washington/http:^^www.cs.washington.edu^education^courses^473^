<H2> Hardcopy Readings:</H2>
<DD> Required text: <i>
The Elements of Artificial Intelligence Using Common Lisp</i>, 2nd edition,
W. H. Freeman, 1995. (I've worked hard to create an AI textbook that is 
self-contained, so you don't have to purchase a separate book on Lisp,
you don't have to buy a separate book on AI example programs, and you
don't have to purchase a separate book on the mathematical theory.)

<H2> Facilities:</H2>
<DD> In order to take advantage of the new Allegro Common Lisp for Windows
implementation of Lisp, with its excellent features for program
development and interface construction, we are using the
Intel Pentium PC laboratory in Sieg Hall.

<DD> There is a free version of Allegro Common Lisp that is
for Windows 95 and Windows NT.  It can be
downloaded from <!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><a href="http://www.franz.com">franz.com</a> on the Web.
If you have this kind of computer at home, with at least 8MB of RAM,
using this may be an attractive option for you.


<H2> Final examination:</H2>
<DD> The final exam for CSE 473 will be given
according to the UW schedule of final examinations.
It will be a closed-book, multiple-choice test.
Bring a mark-sense form with you to the test.  Here is a

of AI techniques in Lisp.  Topics include Lisp programming
techniques, knowledge representation, search, logical
reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, case-based reasoning,
planning, learning, language understanding, vision,
neural nets, and expert systems.
