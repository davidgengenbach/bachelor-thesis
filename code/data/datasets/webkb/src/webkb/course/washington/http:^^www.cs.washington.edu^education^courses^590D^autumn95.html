<hr>
No meeting November 14 --  

<hr>
Reading for November 21 --   
<p>
The readings for this meeting are all online (on the WWW).
<p>
The first paper combines some degree of "vision" (a little)
with some degree of technology (nothing particularly ambitious,
but a description of the state of the art)
<p>

The second paper is a non-technical piece that promotes the
theme of learners taking responsibility for their education --
something that will be increasingly important in the future.
<p>

The two choices for the third reading are papers that are more
sophisticated than either of the first two.  The paper "Beyond 
Browsing" elaborates on the possibility of group annotation of
WWW materials.  The paper "The DEC Web Toolkit" describes in
technical terms a layer of Internet infrastructure that could
make it possible to have "smart distributed tutorial" applications
that do more than what Mosaic or Netscape can achieve.
<p>

Please read both 1 and 2 and either of the options for 3.
