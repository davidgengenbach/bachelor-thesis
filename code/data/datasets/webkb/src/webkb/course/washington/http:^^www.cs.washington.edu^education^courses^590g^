CSE590G, aka "architecture lunch", will continue this quarter with
almost the same  format as previous years,
i.e., selection of papers to be discussed
at the beginning of the quarter, distribution on week n of
the paper to
be read during the week and discussed at week (n+1). There might 
be a few formal presentations of work in progress by
esteemed members of the "lunch".  Mostly
we'll have  (hopefully heated) discussions
on papers from the literature.

<br><br>

The only difference between this quarter and previous quarters
is that we'll start by reading the position papers from
participants of a recent NSF Workshop on
Critical issues in Computer Architecture Research.
You can get a copy  <!WA1><a href =" http://www.cise.nsf.gov/mips/MSAWorkshop96/index2.html">here</a>

<br><br>

Reading these positions papers will lead us to one or more
themes of papers to read this quarter.

<br><br>

With many thanks to Ruth Anderson, Molly Brown, Ori Gershony,
and Matthai Philipose a tabular summary of
the Gurus positions can be found 
<!WA2><a href = "http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/590g/ggg.ps">here</a>

<br><br>

For those of you who are new, our usual format is for one of the
students to lead the discussion of the papers, either informally
or with slides.  Credit for the course is variable: 2 credits if
you present, 1 if you just read.

<br><br>

The first meeting (organization meeting)
will be Tuesday October 1 at 12:30 in 
MOR 226
