<h3> Reading material:</h3>
<UL>

<LI> Pearl:  <EM>Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems</EM><br>
This is the "required" text for the class, and we will read several 
chapters.   You can probably get by without buying it if you're strapped
for cash, though it's a nice reference book. 

<LI> Shafer and Pearl:  <EM>Readings in Uncertain Reasoning</EM><br>
This is a nice collection of foundational papers on reasoning and 
uncertainty, and we will read several selections.  A copy will be 
available in the GRAIL library.

<LI> E.T. Jaynes:  <!WA4><A HREF="ftp://bayes.wustl.edu/Jaynes.book/">Probability 
Theory:  The Logic of Science</A>.<br>
Fragmentary edition of July 1995.  
This is an extremely interesting technical and historical look at the foundations
of probability theory, statistics, and decision theory.  Definitely worth 
looking at for the reference list and historical perspective alone!  The 
math can be heavy going in places, but it's beautifully written.

<LI> Neapolitan:  Probabilistic Reasoning in Expert Systems, Theory and 
Algorithms<br>
A significant overlap with the Pearl book, so a good 
secondary source for information about graphical models and propagation
algorithms.   This is available from the Math Research library.


<LI> Other papers to be arranged.
