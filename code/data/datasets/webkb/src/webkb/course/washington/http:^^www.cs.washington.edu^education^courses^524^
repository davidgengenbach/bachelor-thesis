<h2> Real Description <br></h2>

As a special topics course, the content is up to the whim of the instructor.
A more descriptive title for this year's course would be: A theory of shared 
memory parallel computing, or maybe, topics in the theory of SMPC.
The course will start with a collection of basic algorithms, and then we 
will spend some time on models of computation.  The <!WA19><a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/524/syllabus.html>
syllabus</a> gives a list of topics which could be covered.

<p>

My use of the term "shared memory" is to indicate that we will not be looking
at topics which pertain to specific interconnection topologies.  We
will consider some situations where the cost of memory access is
non-uniform.  

<p>
The course will be a theory course in the sense that we will not
consider particular real machines, we will prove some theorems, and
you will not be expected to log on to a parallel machine.  However,
topics may be motivated by practical considerations.  Our goal in
developing parallel algorithms will be to come up with algorithms
which could conceivably be efficient on some parallel machines.

<p>
I am expecting that there will be three or four problem sets,
containing a mix of routine and challenging problems.  I am not going
to require a project, (but I will be happy if students do outside
work on course related topics).

<p>
The text for the course will be "An Introduction to Parallel
Algorithms" by Ja Ja.  This is a nice book, although I will not be
following it very closely.  If you are feeling exceptionally cheap, you
could probably get by without purchasing a copy.  My original plan,
when I volunteered to teach the course a year ago, was that the text
would be "A Theory of Shared Memory Parallel Computing" by Anderson.
However, this book is progressing about as fast as Volume 7 of the Art
of Computer Programming, so I chose the Ja Ja book instead.

<p>

I am going to be quite flexible on how this course is taught.  My
choice of topics will be influenced by what is considered interesting
or uninteresting.  There is also a choice as to teach this course as
either a traditional lecture course, or to work in some research
content.  I have a number of open problems in mind which could turn
into very nice research results.  I could present my half baked ideas
on some of these, provided that others have the interest and
energy to think about them.
