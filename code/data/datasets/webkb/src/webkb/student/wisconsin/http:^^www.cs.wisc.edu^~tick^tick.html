<h4>
(in Ricardo Montalban voice): Welcome to my home page. Yes, I know that's not
a picture of me (at least, not on a good day), but I'm still looking for
one that's not too incriminating and one that doesn't make me look like a
convict. I do have my baby picture from my high school yearbook, but the last
time I showed that to someone I never heard the end of "What a cute baby!"
Can't have someone thinking that, now can we? :)
<p>
Well, I found a couple of pictures, but the Tick threatened to turn me into
a human Pez dispenser if I took his picture off, hence the pictures can be
found on a separate page by clicking <!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><!WA0><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~tick/test.html">here</a>. For an
autographed copy, sign my name on the monitor on top of where the picture
appears ;););)
