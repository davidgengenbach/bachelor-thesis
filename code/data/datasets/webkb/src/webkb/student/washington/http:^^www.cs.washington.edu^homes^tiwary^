I am a mostly-full-time fourth year graduate student. I work in the area of Single Address Space Operating Systems <!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/levy/opal/opal.html>(Opal)</a>, Persistent Object Systems, Object Oriented Databases, Application Workload Measurement and Operating System Support for Databases. In the past, I have worked with CAD infrastructures, User Interfaces and Distributed Object Systems. In my spare time, I work in the Computer Science group at the Research and Technology Organization of <!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><a href=http://www.boeing.com/>Boeing Computer Services</a>.

<h3><!WA9><!WA9><!WA9><!WA9><!WA9><a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/levy/opal/opal.html>Opal</a></h3>
I am working on distribution in Opal.  Opal is an operating systems project which addresses the issues and opportunities involved with creating a single, global address space, across multiple users and machines.   
<!WA10><!WA10><!WA10><!WA10><!WA10><a href=http://www.cs.duke.edu/~chase/>Jeff Chase</a> is the primary architect of Opal.  <!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><!WA11><a href=http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/levy/> Hank Levy </a> is the advisor working most closely with Opal and is also my advisor. 

<h3> Application Workload Measurement </h3>
I am also work on measuring and characterizing the behavior of persistent object applications and some general techniques for doing this. See the paper below for some of my work in this area.

<h3> Distributed Object Systems </h3>
I have worked on several distributed object systems in my professional career. This
experience was the basis of
