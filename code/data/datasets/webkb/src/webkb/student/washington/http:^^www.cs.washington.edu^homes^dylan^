<h2>What I do:</h2>
My research has concentrated on the interaction between applications
and operating systems. I implemented an operating system mechanism
that allowed applications to implement their own page replacement
policy when the kernel's policy caused them to perform poorly.

<p>
After that, I helped implement "scheduler activations" in the Mach
operating system. Scheduler activations are a mechanism that
help user-level threads systems interact properly with the kernel
thread scheduler.

<p>
These experiences lead me to work with the 
<!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><!WA8><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/spin/www/">SPIN project
</a> folks, who are building a new operating system architecture
that generalizes the idea of application-tailorable operating systems.  

<p>
My current work carries on the research started in the 
<!WA9><!WA9><!WA9><!WA9><!WA9><!WA9><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/levy/opal/opal.html">Opal project.</a> My thesis is investigating the interaction between
Object-oriented databases (OODBs) and operating system virtual memory.
This work is demonstrating that significant improvements in 
performance can be achived using <i>commodity</i> operating systems,
but in a different way than is currently done. Additional improvements
can come from modifying the operating system slightly to better
serve OODBs.

Geoff Voelker and I built this web for the Winter 96 quarter of the 590S 
systems seminar, which was dedicated to Java. I gave a lecture
introducing the Java language and environment.  Here are the
