<h1>Brian Pinkerton</h1><p>
<p>
These days, I'm trying to achieve some sort of balance between real
life and work.  Outside of work, I ski, paddle kayaks, and coach kids.
It's fun!  Every so often, I visit friends in California.  That's fun
too!

I'm currently in the Department of Molecular Biotechnology, working on 
algorithms and tools for mapping genes at a coarse level.  My hope is 
to find some interesting computer applications of sufficient research 
interest to computer scientists that I'll be able to earn my PhD by 
solving them.
<p>
Another current interest is the WebCrawler, a tool I wrote for finding
information in the Web.  In addition to being a great Web indexer, it
can act like an agent, and find stuff for you on the Web.  If you 
want to find out more about the WebCrawler, check out this
