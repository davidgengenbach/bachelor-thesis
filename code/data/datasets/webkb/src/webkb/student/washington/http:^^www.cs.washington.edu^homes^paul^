<p>I used to say that I was a first-year student, but during the

this characterization.</p>

<h2>Where did I come from?</h2>
<p>I got my high-school diploma from Live Oak High School in
Morgan Hill, CA, where I was taught Prolog for the first time.
I graduated in <!WA16><!WA16><!WA16><!WA16><!WA16><!WA16><!WA16><!WA16><A HREF="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</A> from

yes, I was taught Prolog once more at UW.  I'm just glad I
didn't use it during my year at the University of Bergen.)  I
also did research for a professor in the Electrical and

<p>While I was at UC Davis, my partners in various CS-related
activities tended to be <EM>Matt</EM>, <EM>Chris</EM>, and <!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><!WA21><A HREF="http://db.stanford.edu/~jedavis/home.html">James</A>.  (We even
got together recently, using Chris's marriage to Joanne as an
excuse; Chris's brother also made it
in the photo.)</p>

<p>Throughout my undergraduate years, I kept biking more and more,
but never very far (Davis isn't that big, and it's flat).
During my year as an exchange student to the University of
Bergen, I biked hillier and longer routes, so when I returned
to Davis, I took up rollerblading, since biking around town was
now too easy.</p>
<p>My biking dropped off during the year I worked at Hewlett
Packard, but it returned with a vengeance when I moved to
Seattle.  I've done the annual Seattle-to-Portland bike ride in
two days; I may do it in one some year.  But that's only in
season (March/April-June).  The rest of the year, I just
commute by bike and do lots of <!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><!WA22><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mfisher/dancing.html">dancing</A>, particularly Lindy
Hop.</p>
