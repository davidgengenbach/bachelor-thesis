<h1> <a name="top">Tracy Kimbrel is being held prisoner!</a><br></h1>

Tracy Kimbrel has been held prisoner at the University of Washington
since 1982 without charge or trial.  He was moved for six years to
another Seattle area prison, where most of the inmates are forced to
manufacture airplanes.  He escaped that institution, but was
recaptured and returned to the University of Washington.  Help end his
plight!  Rescue him from his imprisonment.

Here is a list of things he has done

while imprisoned.  Here are some more details and a statement of
what he promises to do for you
<!WA1><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/tracyk/statement.ps"><b> (history and goals) </b></a>
if you free him from his captors.
