Did you know that I'm a second year graduate computer science student
at the University of Washington?  Well I am.  And that's all I have to
say about that.<p>

For those business type people with little time on their hands, I had
to include my resume link at the top, in <!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><!WA1><a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/edhong/edresume.ps">postcript</a>
and in plain <!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/edhong/edresume.txt">text</A> form.<p>



My office: room 233 Seig Hall; (206)543-7798. <br>
My current home: (206) 244-1261<p>

Currently, I'm working with Anna Karlin and Craig Chambers on a 
theoretical model for dynamic compilation. More specifically, I'm working
on developing an on-line algorithm that will work well for
dynamic compilation. I plan this to be my quals project.  <P>

I own a Power Macintosh, so I guess that makes me biased towards
liking macs. However, I think better computers that are even
easier to use have yet to come....<p>
