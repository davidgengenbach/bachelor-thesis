Cecil is a new pure object-oriented langauge that we are using as a
vehicle for integrated research in the areas of language design,
programming environments, and optimizing compiler techniques.  We
intend for our techniques to scale to large, real-world programs, and
to keep ourselves true to this goal, we're implementing the Vortex
compiler in Cecil.  We currently have about 70,000 lines of Cecil code
in the compiler.

<h2>Research Interests</h2> 
</td>
<td>

My research concerns the efficient implementation of
object-oriented languages through compiler optimization techniques.
In particular, I am exploring how whole-program analysis can be used
to improve performance, how it affects incremental compilation, and
how it interacts with other optimization techniques, especially
profile-guided optimization techniques.  I am also interested in how
whole-program optimization affects language design: if it is assumed
that the compiler will have access to the entire program, then many
compromises made in existing language designs become unnecessary.  I
am interested in applying the lessons learned in exploring whole
program optimization towards designing a new systems programming
language that is both flexible and efficient, based on an underlying
implementation that does whole program analysis.<p>

To validate my research, I have been one of the three principal
designers and developers of Vortex, an optimizing compiler for
object-oriented languages.  Vortex defines a language-independent
intermediate language for object-oriented languages that is
high-enough level to permit optimization of features such as message
sends, closures, and object creations.  It also contains a unique way
of composing optimization passes so that they run in parallel,
obtaining better results than repeatedly running the passes
separately.  For example, the compiler applies intraprocedural class
analysis, profile-guided receiver class prediction, inlining, alias
analysis, splitting, and CSE all at once, in a single combined pass.
Part of the work on Vortex has been to develop ways of structuring
optimization passes to permit this kind of composition while still
allowing the passes to be developed largely independently of each
other.  We have a nice framework for specifying iterative data flow
analyses that permits clients to develop new optimization passes with
relatively little effort (for example, the Vortex dead assignment
elimination pass is approximately 50 lines of code).

My wife and I took the flight, which consisted of a 20 minute flight around and over downtown Seattle and Puget Sound in a <!WA29><!WA29><!WA29><!WA29><!WA29><!WA29><!WA29><!WA29><!WA29><!WA29><!WA29><!WA29><!WA29><A HREF="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/jdean/biplane.html">Travel Air 1927 model biplane</A>.  I was feeling daring, but, sadly, their insurance coverage doesn't permit passengers to walk on the wing, so we just sat back and enjoyed the ride and the view.  It would have been fantastic even if we'd had to pay for it.  Highly recommended!  If you're looking for something fun to do in Seattle, their number is 763-0350.
