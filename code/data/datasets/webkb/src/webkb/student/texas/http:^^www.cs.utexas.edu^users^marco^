<H2>Research</H2>
The title of my dissertation is
<!WA2><!WA2><A href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/marco/abstract.html"> "Flow Routing in Computer Networks"</A>.
My research interests lie in the areas of network protocols, distributed 
computing, fault-tolerance, and in particular self-stabilizing systems.
<p> 

Implicit in the design of any system is a labeling of its
states as "legitimate" or "illegitimate". We identify as "legitimate" 
those states which occur under the correct (intended) execution of a system.
All other states are considered "illegitimate". 
A system is said to be self-stabilizing when
regardless of its initial state, it is guaranteed to converge to
a legitimate state in a finite number of steps. A system
which is not self-stabilizing may stay in an illegitimate state 
forever.
