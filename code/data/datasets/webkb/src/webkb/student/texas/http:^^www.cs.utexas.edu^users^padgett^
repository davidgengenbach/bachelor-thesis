I am working with Professor J.C. Browne on the design and
implementation of device control software (a.k.a. device drivers).  
We are investigating the creation of a domain-specific 
programming environment for constructing this class of 
software.
<P>

The focus of our work thus far has been on language and compiler 
technologies.  We have devised a prototype domain-specific language for 
specifying device control softare called VDL (Virtual Device Language).  
This language contains various features for reducing the effort 
required to construct this class of software.  A reference manual
for VDL is currently being constructed.  A <a href="manual.ps"> 
postscript draft </a> of the manual is available for viewing.  
Example VDL specifications are also available for viewing.
<P>

VDL specifications for the 8253 Counter Component are available in 
the following files:
<UL>
<LI> <a href="c8253.pcn"> c8253.pcn </a> (physical component interface file) 
<LI> <a href="c8253.vcm"> c8253.vcm </a> (virtual component implementation file) 
<LI> <a href="c8253.vcx"> c8253.vcx </a> (virtual component export file) 
<LI> <a href="c8253.vcn"> c8253.vcn </a> (virtual component interface file) 
</UL>

VDL specifications for the PC-LPM-16 Multifunction I/O Device are 
available in the following files:
<UL>
<LI> <a href="lpm.pdn"> lpm.pdn </a> (physical device interface file) 
<LI> <a href="lpm.vdm"> lpm.vdm </a> (virtual device implementation file) 
<LI> <a href="lpm.vdx"> lpm.vdx </a> (virtual device export file) 
<LI> <a href="lpm.vdn"> lpm.vdn </a> (virtual device interface file) 
</UL>

<a href="intel.ppt"> Transparencies </a> used in a recent presentation 
are also available for viewing.  They were created using Microsoft PowerPoint
Version 7.0b for Windows 95.
