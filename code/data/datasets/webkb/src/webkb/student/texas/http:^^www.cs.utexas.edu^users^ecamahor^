<H2> About my Promise of Setting up a Decent! Home Page After the Summer </H2>

<!-- This is some text about me. It's typed pretty much in a freeform 
     paragraph ending with a paragraph break (a P in angle brackets). -->

Mmmmm!? After multiple complaints about me not meeting my previous 
home page deadline ..... 

<P>

I have come up with another excuse .... :^) :^)

<P>

You know .... I HAVE TO get my SIGGRAPH paper finished by January,
15th ....

<P>

So that's the only thing I can think 'bout right now ....

<P>

And no, I won't make any more promises this time .....

<P>

Or else, I'll lose the credibility I have left ..... if any .....

<P>

<!--A bullet list is easy to include as well:
<UL>
<LI>Here's the first item.
<LI>Here's another.
<LI>And this is a third.
</UL>

Here's another paragraph. Don't forget that paragraph break.
