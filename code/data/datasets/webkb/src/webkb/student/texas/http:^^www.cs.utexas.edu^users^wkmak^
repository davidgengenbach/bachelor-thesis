  <H1>How I became a Christian</H1>
</center>
<HR>
I made a major decision in my life and believed in Jesus Christ only a
little more than two months after coming to the U.S. This was totally
unexpected. Though religious studies was a compulsory class at the
Christian high school I attended in Hong Kong, I had no intention to
become a Christian at that time. I thought that the record of Jesus's
life in the bible was quite credible, and his teaching was good, but 
I did not take time to think about it deeply as how it related to my
life. Also, my misconception of the meaning of becoming a Christian
was not cleared until I came to the U.S. <P>

In the past, I thought there was no difference between any Christian
and me. We all do wrongs and sin. And I thought that if God loved
every one of us, then it did not matter whether I decided to be a
Christian or not. Also, I used to think that a true Christian should
be virtuous and holy, so I was not good enough to be a Christian.
However, after listening to the friends in the church and the
fellowship, I realized things I did not see before. <P>

It is true that Christians also have sins when they were born, they
will also stumble and do wrongs. However, God became flesh, though he
is sinless he is able to sympathize with our weaknesses, and <em> if we
confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and
to cleanse us from all unrighteousness</em> (I John 1:9).  The difference
between Christians and other people is that they trust Jesus Christ as
their saviour. They have gratefully accepted Christ's redemption for
their sins. <em>Therefore a man is justified by faith without the deeds of
the law</em> (Romans 3:28). <P>

There is no doubt that a Christian should live a holy life, but we
do not have to be holy before we can become Christians. On the
contrary, we should rely on God and through the strength he gives
us to become holy. And Jesus has said, <em>"They that be whole need not
a physician, but they that are sick."</em> (Matthew 9:12) If we count on
our own strength, we are not able to become holy. <P>

We do not know the number of days we have, so we ought to seek the
truth as early as we can.
Don't hesitate and start to seek now. I thank
God for leading me to the U.S. to give me the opportunity to really 
know him.
