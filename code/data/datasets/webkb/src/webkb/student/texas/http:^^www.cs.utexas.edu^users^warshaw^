<H2>About Me</H2>

I am a Senior Computer Science student who has recently been accepted into graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin.  My graduate work will be in the area of active databases and rule-based systems.
My current position at the Applied Research Laboratory
involves maintaining Venus, a rule-based language developed
at the University of Texas at Austin by <!WA3><a href = "http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/miranker"> Dan Miranker </a> and
at the Applied Research Laboratories by Lance Obermeyer.
