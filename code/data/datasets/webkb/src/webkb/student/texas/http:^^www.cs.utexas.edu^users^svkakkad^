<h2>Research Information</h2>

I am a member of the <!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><!WA2><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/oops/"> OOPS Research Group</a> in
the <!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><!WA3><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/svkakkad//"> Department of Computer Sciences</a> at

<p>

As part of my Ph.D. research, I have implemented a persistent storage
system, called <b>Texas</b>, for C++. It provides easy persistence,
while using a novel technique called "pointer swizzling at page fault
time" to efficiently support large addresses on standard hardware.<p>

For more information, please see the <!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/svkakkad/papers.html">list of my
publications</a> (along with brief descriptions). <p>

I plan to graduate with a Ph.D. in Computer Science in May 1996. My
resume is available in <!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><!WA6><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/svkakkad/resume.ps">Postscript</a>. <p>

I am currently working at Motorola at Somerset Design Center, while
finishing up my Ph.D. in Computer Science.
