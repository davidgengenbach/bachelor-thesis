all me Steven.  Some years ago, nevermind how long exactly, I
arrived as a second son to a set of proud parents.  If this sounds
like <em>Moby Dick</em> to you, then let me assure you, I have no
intention of finding a ship to hunt a whale.  But I digress.
Brought up in Taiwan until the tender age of seven, my whole
family migrated south to the tropical islands of the Philippines.
There we made our home, and lived some fifteen years.  Here's

six years old.

thus became quite fluently bilingual.  As I love to read, the
poetry of the Tang Dynasty, the Arabian Nights - quite naturally,
the children's version, and a host of other stories somewhat 
fulfilled the <em>Wen</em> in my name which means 'Literature'.

class in grade seven was to set the course of my life.  I dove
right into the marvel that was a computer.  Four years later, I
entered the <!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><!WA5><a href="http://www.upd.edu.ph">University of the Philippines</a>
with that as my major, and very likely my career.

had found talent in me that draws me to the art and science of
computing, and unabashedly, knew I was quite good at it.  Was also
in College when I met <!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><!WA7><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/szuwen/mabs.gif">her</a> - and I she met.
In a whirlwind of happiness and peace three years and running, a
woman has become the most important part of my life, effortlessly 
defeating my hobbies of old with her love.

eeking a career more ideal, and higher paying to be blunt, I
enrolled in the Cornell University graduate program.  Thus far,
I have been rewarded with almost everything I have ever wanted and
worked for.  I am a lucky man."

Welcome to my home page.  To segregate myself from your everyday
geek, I'd like to think I'm a man of many interests.  Aside from
actually writing a C program, here's what I'd happily do in my

In the field of computers, I also have a rather broad spectrum of
interests, though my studies have concentrated in the areas of
computer graphics and networking.  If you wish to be offended by
some blatant self-promotion, you may want to check out my
