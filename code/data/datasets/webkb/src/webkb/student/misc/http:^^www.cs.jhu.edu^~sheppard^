Currently, I am a graduate student in the Johns Hopkins Department of
Computer Science, finishing up my Ph.D.  I am writing my thesis on
memory-based reinforcment learning applied to solving differential
games (Keep checking back for a downloadable copy).  Since I am
attempting to solve the games (i.e., figure out 
game values and optimal strategies for "both" players), my research
takes me into the realm of multi-agent learning, meaning ALL players
are learning simultaneously. Some of the early results of my research
can be found in the list of <!WA13><a href = "http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~sheppard/pubs.html">papers</a>.

<P>

In addition to working on my Ph.D., I am also employed as a Principal
Research Analyst at ARINC Incorporated.  My research at ARINC is quite
different from the work here at Hopkins.  At ARINC, I am responsible for
IR&D (independent research and development) activities in the areas of
intelligent test, diagnosis, and network fault management.  My publications
in these areas are much more extensive than the list shown <!WA14><a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~sheppard/pubs.html#diagnosis">here</a>.  
Unfortunately,
only a few of those papers are available electronically.  People interested in
receiving a list of my publications in test and diagnosis should contact
me at any of the above ARINC addresses.

<P>

Another responsibility of mine at ARINC is active participation in
professional societies and standards writing bodies, namely the IEEE, AAAI,
<!WA15><a href="http://stdsbbs.ieee.org">IEEE standards activities</a>, and
the IEC. In particular, I am the 
IEEE Computer Society liaison to IEEE Standards Coordinating Committee 20
(SCC20).  SCC20 is responsible for writing several standards related to
electronics testing (e.g., ATLAS, ABBET, and AI-ESTATE).  I am also the
co-chair of the <!WA16><a
href="http://stdsbbs.ieee.org/groups/ai-estate/index.html">
AI-ESTATE</a> (artificial intelligence exchange and service tie
to all test environments) data and knowledge representation working
group.  Recently, I was appointed by the
<!WA17><a href="http://ada.computer.org:80/tab/tttc">IEEE Computer Society
TTTC</a> (test technology technical committee), which is responsible
for the 1149 standards (e.g., boundary scan), to co-chair the TTTC
System Test TAC (technical activity committee). 

<p>

Also, I have been
appointed by the TTTC to the Test Technology Standards Committee.
Finally, I have been given the distinct honor of being named a
U.S. delegate to the IEC/TC93 plenary meeting in Copenhagen. TC93 is
the technical committee for Design Automation, working on standards
such as EDIF and VHDL. TC93 recently formed a new working group (WG7)
for test and is working to "fast-track" several standards from the
IEEE to become IEC standards. The first will be ATLAS. Of particular
interest to me is AI-ESTATE which is being proposed as a joint IEC/ISO
standard.
