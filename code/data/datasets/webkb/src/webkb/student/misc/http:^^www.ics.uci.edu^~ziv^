<H3>Course Information </H3>

I teach two courses for
<!WA6><a href="http://www.unex.uci.edu/~unex/">UCI Extension</a>,
one on object-oriented analysis and design,
the other on Windows NT/95 Programming using Visual C++ and MFC.
<BR>
The textbook for my Object-Oriented Analysis and Design course is
<BR>
<!WA7><a href="http://heg-school.aw.com/cseng/authors/booch/Aps2e/Aps2e.html">
Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications</a>
by
<!WA8><a href="http://heg-school.aw.com/cseng/authors/booch/about-booch.html">
Grady Booch</a>,
<BR>
published by
<!WA9><a href="http://aw.com/">Addison Wesley</a>.

<H3>Research Projects</H3>

I develop a hypertext browser, called 
<!WA10><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ivan/">IVAN</a>,
that affords better traceability of software systems by explicit
modeling of software uncertainties.
<BR>
This work is done as part of the
<!WA11><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/atUCI.html">Arcadia</a>
research project at
<!WA12><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">UC Irvine</a>.

<H3>Research Papers</H3>

I recently completed a paper for
<!WA13><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/icse97/">ICSE 97</a>
on explicit modeling of software uncertainties.
The paper in its original, 10-point font, two column style
as required by ICSE, is entitled
<BR>
<!WA14><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ziv/papers/icse97.ps">
"The Uncertainty Principle in Software Engineering."</a>
<BR>
To get the latest version of the paper, click
<!WA15><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ziv/uncertainty/latestversion.ps">
Here</a>.
<BR>
Links to earlier versions of this paper can also be found in the
collection of papers on
<BR>
<!WA16><a href="http://laser.cs.umass.edu/workflow/">Workflow and Process
Automation</a>.

<H3>Professional Interests</H3>

I know a few things about software engineering, software
process modeling, and object-oriented analysis and design.
I am also interested in Bayesian networks and uncertainty
modeling.

<H3>Object-Oriented Techniques</H3>

I am familiar with leading methods for OO analysis and design,
including the latest work on the Unified
Modeling Language (UML) and the OPEN/MOSES effort.
<BR>
I am in fact a member of the
<!WA17><a href="http://www.csse.swin.edu.au/cotar/OPEN/OPEN.html">
OPEN Consortium</a>.
<BR>
For information on UML, see Rational's
<!WA18><a href="http://www.rational.com/ot/">Object Technology</a>
web page.
<BR>
A good source of information on OO CASE Tools on the Web
can be found
<!WA19><a href="http://osiris.sunderland.ac.uk/sst/casepages/tools.html">
Here</a>.
In addition,
a collection of more than 2000 links about object-orientation
is available at
<BR>
<!WA20><a href="http://www.rhein-neckar.de/~cetus/software.html">
Cetus, Heidelberg, Germany</a>,
<BR>
with mirror U.S. sites in
<!WA21><a href="http://www.objenv.com/cetus/software.html">
Chicago, Illinois</a>
<BR>
and
<!WA22><a href="http://mini.net/cetus/software.html">
Provo, Utah</a>.

<H3>Bayesian Networks</H3>

I am interested in Bayesian networks.  There are a few quality pages
on this topic, including:
<BR>
<!WA23><a href="http://www.afit.af.mil/Schools/EN/ENG/LABS/AI/BayesianNetworks/bayesianNetworks.html">AFIT AI Laboratory</a>
<BR>
<!WA24><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/ldc/WWW/bayes-net-research/bayes-net-research.html">Lonnie Chrisman's Roadmap to Bayesian Research</a>
<BR>
Also, you can find a Bayesian Network Editor, implemented in Java, in the
<BR>
<!WA25><a href="http://www.nero.net/~nagarasr/bayesnet/">Bayesian Editor page</a>

<H3>Other Interests</H3>

Besides my profesional interests, I like to hike, jog, swim, and
rollerblade.  My favorite place to play roller-hockey is the
<!WA26><a href="http://inwinc.com/1004/">Irvine Hockey Club</a>.
<BR>
My favorite sport, however, is soccer.
A good place to look for the latest soccer information is the
<!WA27><a href="http://espnet.sportszone.com/soccer/">ESPN Sports Zone Soccer</a>
web page.
For additional sports links, check with my friend

<H3>Getting started with HTML</H3>

UCI's Office of Academic Computing has put together
some pointers on
<!WA30><A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/WWWdocs/localFAQ.html#HTML">
how to learn HTML</A>.
