<h2>Random Blurb</h2>
<p>Welcome to Christian's home page.  He isn't here in person to tell you
about himself, so this page will have to do.</p>
<p>
Christian just graduated from  
<!WA1><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>
where he completed his B.S. in 
<!WA2><a href="http://www-cs.stanford.edu/">Computer Science</a>.  
He is now at <!WA3><a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>
in a Ph.D. program in the 
<!WA4><a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/">AI Lab</a> there.  
</p>
<p>Christian just gave up <!WA5><a href="http://downtime.stanford.edu">downtime</a>
to <!WA6><a href="http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~atwood/">Scott</a> so that
the <!WA7><a href="http://downtime.stanford.edu/topten/">Interactive Top Ten List</a>
can live on at its present address when he departs 
<!WA8><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a>.  Of course, this doesn't
really mean he gave up his machine, but rather just the name.  In fact,
this isn't the first time this has happened.  Downtime has had a long hidden
<!WA9><a href="http://downtime.stanford.edu/history.html">history</a>.
</p>
<p>
When Christian was an undergrad, he used to
<!WA10><a href="http://www-cs198.stanford.edu/">section lead</a> the CS106
courses and dance with the 
<!WA11><a href="http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/dance/groups/ensemble.html">
Stanford Vintage Dance Ensemble</a>.  Both are outstanding groups that
helped to make his undergraduate years wonderful ones.
</p>
<p>
Many of Christian's
<!WA12><a href="http://downtime.stanford.edu/~cshelton/friends.html">friends</a>
are on the web.  You can stop by and visit them.
</p><p>
Christian just wrapped up his undergraduate research in computational
molecular biology.  He has co-authored 
<!WA13><a href="http://downtime.stanford.edu/~cshelton/ligand.ps">one paper</a>
on this work.
</p>
<p>
Christian is also excited to announce that his
<!WA14><a href="http://info-physics.ucdavis.edu/Text/shelton.html">Dad</a>
is on the web.  Go DAD!
