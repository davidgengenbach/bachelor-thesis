<br>Information 
</a></th><th></th> <td><hr>Aside from being a part-time graduate student in 
Computer Science, I am also a full-time employee of the 
University of Victoria, Computing and Systems Services. I work in 
Education Services Group and am
often developing or giving courses in DOS,
Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX applications. 
I recently presented a seminar "Creating a
Home Page - A Beginner's Guide". The 
<!WA6><a href="http://castle.uvic.ca/comped/online/homepage/seminar.html">
slides are available on-line.</a> <strong>Note: I am on study leave, April 1

I am very interested in exploring the Web as a teaching tool. For
a project this term, I have developed the first part of an 
interactive tutorial in logic.

<p>Also, this is a convenient place to put <!WA8><a href="http://gulf.uvic.ca/~miers/april_acm.html">notes</a> on my research into adult 
learning styles.<hr></tr>

<th>Personal
<br>Information <th></th> <td>I love opera, classical guitar - I will get back
to playing as soon as I finish graduate studies, and gardening. One of my favorite
web resources for gardening is the
<!WA9><a href="http://www.pathfinder.com/cgi-bin/VG/vg">Time Life Complete
Gardener</a> search page. Finally, just for fun, 
I have a virtual tour of my 
<!WA10><a href="http://gulf.uvic.ca/~miers/kitchen/kitchen1.html">kitchen</a>, which makes extensive use of client-side
imagemaps.
