<H2> You reached Mihaela ... </H2> 
<!WA0><IMG  WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=160 SRC="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mihaela/me.gif"> 
<P>
<H3> I'm a PhD student in computer science at <!WA1><A HREF="http://www.cs.unm.edu">University of New Mexico, Albuquerque </A>. My hometown is <!WA2><A HREF="http://www.utt.ro/~ionel/Timisoara.html">Timisoara</A>, located in the western part of <!WA3><A HREF="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/istrate/rom.html">Romania</A>. The page about Timisoara is rather slow to load, but it has some pictures to help anyone  get a feel about the architecture. And because I was asked often enough, romanians speak a latin-based language, Romanian. 

<P> The major points of my professional trajectory:
<UL>
<LI> M.D. from the University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Timisoara, Romania. </LI>
<LI> Development of computational models for the immune system as part of theoretical immunology programs of the <!WA4><A HREF="http://www.santafe.edu">Santa Fe Institute</A> and Los Alamos National Laboratory. These programs are directed by Alan Perelson.</LI>
<LI> Currently working on my PhD, with <!WA5><A HREF="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~forrest"> Stephanie Forrest </A>. </LI>
</UL>

<P> My research interests revolve around
<UL>
<LI> <!WA6><A HREF="http://www.santafe.edu/projects/immunology">theoretical immunology</A>: the focus of the models that I work with is the B cell immune response, both in terms of antibody production and development of memory.</LI>
<LI> <!WA7><A HREF="http://www.cog.brown.edu/pointers/cognitive.html">cognitive science</A>: I am exploring a model of concept acquisition based on <!WA8><A HREF="http://nucleus.hut.fi/nnrc.html"> self-organizing maps.</A></LI>
<LI> <!WA9><A HREF="http://www.krl.caltech.edu/~brown/complex.html">complex systems</A> </LI>
