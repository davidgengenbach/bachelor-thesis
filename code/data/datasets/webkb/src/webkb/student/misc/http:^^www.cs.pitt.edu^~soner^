<h3>Area: Computer Architecture and Programming Languages</h3>

<h3>Interests:</h3>
  
<UL>
<LI><h4>Architecture:</h4>
<UL>
    
<LI>I am very much intrigued by the idea that you can bring common
    building blocks (say bricks if you will) in more ways than any
    of us can imagine. I call the way this is done <i>architecture</i>.
    If I had lived earlier, many years before the mankind invented
    computers, I sure would want to work with and learn from my favorite 
    architect Mimar Sinan and build mosques, bridges, and houses.

<LI>However, I now shuffle imaginary components around, trying to come
    up with an execution paradigm which is simple in concept, easy 
    to implement but in no way as dull as a solid brick wall. I am
    after elegance, one which is useful. This is what I call <i>computer
    architecture</i>, I now work on with my supervisor 
    <!WA4><a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~gupta">Rajiv Gupta</a>.

<LI><h4>Computer architecture:</h4>
<UL>

<LI>  In order to sort through a zillion bad ideas and find the few 
      which are good, I thought it would be easier if I could design
      and develop a tool that can be used to define a Computer
      Architecture at the RTL level and obtain the assembler, and 
      the simulator for the architecture automatically. The result
      was UPFAST (University of Pittsburgh Flexible
      Architecture Simulation Tool). I'm currently implementing
      UPFAST.

<LI>  I am using UPFAST to simulate my novel idea that I call 
      <i>Data Forwarding</i>, which is outlined in my 
      <!WA5><a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~soner/abstracts/proposal.html"> proposal</a>.

<LI>  I have designed computer architectures which are different 
      implementations of the data forwarding idea.
      They are described in my 
<!WA6><a href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~soner/paper-guide.html">publications</a>.

<LI><h4>Computer languages:</h4>
<UL>
   
<LI>  I consider computer languages and compiler technology inseparable
      parts of Computer Architecture research. I speak all but lisp,
      prolog and a couple other languages.
 
<LI>  I used to program using ALGOL (the father of your favorite C) but
      nobody remembers this language any more. Nobody seems to remember 
      what reliability, predictability, and reproducibility of errors
      mean either.

<LI> My favorite operating system is NOT Unix, and it is NOT produced 
     by Microsoft. In the absence of it, I use Linux (at home and
     at work) and like it.
