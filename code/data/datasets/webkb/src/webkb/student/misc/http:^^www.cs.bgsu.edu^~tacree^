<H1>Tom Acree</H1>

<B>WELCOME TO MY PERSONAL WEB PAGE!</B> I am a computer science grad student here at <!WA1><A HREF="http://www.bgsu.edu/">Bowling Green State University</A>.  This diversion has been as interesting attempt at avoiding the real world at all costs.<P>

As you can see in the picture above, I spend a lot of time in my office on (or in) my computer.  <!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cs.bgsu.edu/~tacree/window-view.html">Here is a view</A> from my office window on the 5'th floor of the administration building.  <!WA3><A HREF="http://www.cs.bgsu.edu/~tacree/screen-view.html">Here is the view</A> from my computer screen.

Here is some stuff you'll find here

Currently I am working as one of the honorary <!WA23><A HREF="http://www.bgsu.edu/welcome/webmasters.html">BGSU Web Webmasters</A>.  Some of the projects I've completed during this project include creating a <!WA24><A HREF="http://www.bgsu.edu/welcome/tour/">Tour of BGSU</A>, the <!WA25><A HREF="http://www.bgsu.edu/explorer/styleGuide/">BGSU Web Styleguide</A>, the<!WA26><A HREF="http://www.bgsu.edu/explorer/"> BGSU Explorer</A>, and the <!WA27><A HREF="http://www.cs.bgsu.edu/template/">BGSU Web Page Template Composer</A>.  I also assisted in the redesign of the <!WA28><A HREF="http://www.bgsu.edu/">BGSU Web</A>. <P>   

My current project and daily tasks involve performing group and one to one training sessions to assist departments and offices in developing their own web pages, serving on the <!WA29><A HREF="http://www.bgsu.edu/explorer/styleGuide/taskForce.html">BGSU W3 Task Force</A>, maintaining the Pagemaster Listprocessor, and assisting the other Webmasters with their duties.  I am also working on looking at some new statistical packages, and search tools for use by departments and ourselves.<P> 

As a <!WA30><A HREF="http://www.cs.bgsu.edu/">BGSU Computer Science</A> Graduate student, I am working with my colleague <!WA31><A HREF="http://www.cs.bgsu.edu/~dzeller/">Dean Zeller</A> on designing a Tennis Tournament monitoring application for USTA Tournaments.  We are using <!WA32><A HREF="http://www.borland.com/Product/Lang/Delphi/Delphi.html">Borland Delphi</A> to create this application, and are currently in the process of developing the interface.  Come back in January for some screen captures of what our interface will look like.  <P> 

To see information on some of the other projects I've done, see the <!WA33><A HREF="http://www.cs.bgsu.edu/~tacree/resume/projects.html">Projects</A> section of my online <!WA34><A HREF="http://www.cs.bgsu.edu/~tacree/resume/HomePage.html">resume</A>.

I enjoy playing piano; would you believe I began college as a piano performance major at <!WA35><A HREF="http://www.heidelberg.edu/">Heidelberg College</A> in Tiffin, Ohio?!  This only lasted a semester though.  You have to be pretty damned good to be a performance major these days.  I'd have starved by now.  When I get the time, I still enjoy playing though.<P>

I have often been asked (usually by guitar players) to list my musical influences.  This is considered a very cool thing to do; and actually, I'm not even sure you are allowed to learn to play an instrument these days unless you have a good list of influences.  I unfortunately learned to play <B>before</B> I had a good list (probably why I never made it as a performer), but have managed to come up with some now.  Hopefully, its not too late.  They are as follows:<P>

<UL>
<LI>The prolific and ingenius Sister Pat Neckel.  
<LI>Sister Thomas, she started me out, and my fingers have never forgot.  OUCH!
<LI>Sister Marie Reinhart, the teacher I had the longest, she makes Job (you know the prophet)  look like a nervous basket case.
<LI>Professor Catherine Thiedt, The greatest organ player I've ever seen in my life. 
<LI>Last but not least, my high school band teacher Bill Bleyle, the percussion wizard. 
</UL><P>

I also love tennis and play every chance I can get;  In fact, I think about it nearly every waking moment.  I'm thinking about it right now.  Mmmmmm 40-love.  If you like tennis too, then you may be interested in the <!WA36><A HREF="http://www.cs.bgsu.edu/~tacree/results.1995.html">1995 Professional Men's tennis results</A> listed by tournament.  And look, here is the <!WA37><A HREF="http://www.cs.bgsu.edu/~tacree/schedule.1996.html">1996 Professional Men's tennis schedule</A>.  <P>

Other things include reading, playing other racquet sports, and of course, playing with computers.

Currently nothing here, but check back.  This is going to be a place where we can all collaborate on creating limericks.

<H3>More To Come, Stop Back Again...</H3>

Hey, I'm just getting started; I hope to find time to put some more interesting things up as time and life allows.
