<H2> Family </H2>

My parents, Jeanne and
<!WA8><A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/bdietz/">Bryan Dietz</A>,
live in southern Orange County,
California.  My father works for 
<!WA9><A HREF="http://www.sync.com/">Sync Research</A>, of Irvine, California,
as their resident TCP/IP guru.  My mother is
now employed by FHP Health Care as an ultrasound technician.  Both received
bachelors degrees from the <!WA10><A HREF="http://www.und.nodak.edu/">
University of North Dakota at Grand Forks</A>, my father in mechanical
engineering and my mother in speech therapy. <p>

My sisters are now attending college.  Laura is
at <!WA11><A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</A> in Palo
Alto, California, while Shelby is at <!WA12><A HREF="http://www.cornell.edu/">
Cornell University</A> in Ithaca, New York. <p>

Here's a <!WA13><A HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/jdietz/family.html">picture</A> of my family.

<H2> History </H2>

I was born in a close suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota in the winter
of 1973.  Nothing really eventful happened, except I almost
electrocuted myself with a Christmas tree ornament in 1975.  We spent
six months in Montgomery, Alabama in 1974-5 and nine in San Diego,
California in 1977-8.  This latter stay convinced my mother that she
was tired of snow, and eventually we moved to Southern California in
1984.  I have not moved from this area since then. <p>

I have attended a total of eight elementary and secondary schools, and
so don't feel much attachment to any of them, even the high school
from which I graduated, Laguna Hills High School in (guess where?)
Laguna Hills, California.



<H2> Aspirations </H2>

<H3> Travel </H3>

Since I was a young boy, I've been fascinated by space flight.
Unfortunately, I have doubts that I'll ever get a chance to ride a
rocket.  In fact, not counting the cities of Vancouver, British
Columbia and Tijuana, Baja California, I haven't even left the
country.  I've been through large parts of it on road trips with my
family, though, and very much enjoy seeing the countryside instead of
flying over it.

<H3> Employment </H3>

As a grad student, I sometimes think about what life would be like
were I employed.  I'm very glad that there are employment
opportunities in the areas I'm interested in -- it's a shame when
people have to work at jobs that they don't enjoy.  However, I'd also
like to work at a job where I felt I was making a difference in the
world, and being a minion of the <!WA14><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">
Borg</A> doesn't fit with that ideal.  I feel that I could make the
most effective contribution in the field of OS design right now,
because it's what I've been researching for almost a year now, but not
many companies are deploying radically new operating system designs
right now.
