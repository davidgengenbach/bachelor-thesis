Welcome to my home page!
</H2>

<P>
I'm a computer science grad student here at UCSD, working on my master's 
degree.  I come originally from  <!WA1><A HREF="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/michaels/edmonton.html">Edmonton</A>, Alberta, Canada, but I've been here in California for a good while now, as I did my undergrad at <!WA2><A 
 HREF="http://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</A> in Claremont, California.  

<H2>
Research
</H2>

I have been working at the <!WA3><A HREF="http://www.sdsc.edu/">San Diego
 Supercomputer Center</A> since March of 1995.  Initially I was working on
SDSC's VRML browser, <!WA4><A
 HREF="http://www.sdsc.edu/EnablingTech/Visualization/vrml/webview.html">WebView</A>, for which I implemented the network support. Over the last several 
 months I implemented SDSC's VRML behavior system, <!WA5><A HREF="http://rosebud.sdsc.edu/EnablingTech/Visualization/Behaviors/">VRBS</A>, 
which was demonstrated at <!WA6><A
 HREF="http://www.sdsc.edu/Events/vrml_behavior/">The VRML Behavior
  Workshop</A> in October, and at <!WA7><A HREF="http://www.sdsc.edu/SC95/">Supercomputing 95</A> and <!WA8><A HREF="http://rosebud.sdsc.edu/Events/vrml95/">VRML 95</A> in December. This   
year I am working on my master's thesis, VizWiz, a java applet for 
interactive scientific visualization on the web.

You can find out more about these projects below.
