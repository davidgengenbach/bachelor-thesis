Hi there...!!! welcome my WWW page. Finally I decided to construct it. 
Well... What could I say about me...? I am a mexican student at this School, 
I am trying to learn almost everything from everywhere about anything 
while my studies here at McGill, before my scholarship finishes.
I decided to construct this page mainly for fun, but I will try to include
some stuff about the formal job I am doing.<em></em><br><br>


My <i>alma mater</i> is <!WA3><a href="http://www.unam.mx">  
Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), </a> specifically, I 
studied at <!WA4><a href="http://www.fciencias.unam.mx> Facultad de Ciencias, 
</a> and made my bachelor thesis at <a href="http://gauss.matem.unam.mx> 
Instituto de Matematicas </a> (of course, every place inside UNAM). This is 
almost, up to now, my academic history...<br></br>

  Here, at McGill, I am studying with Prof. Denis Therien. We are trying to
work on Complexity Theory; specifically on relationships among boolean circuits
complexity, algebra and logic. Right now, I work on a problem about
characterizing all <i> NEUTRAL <i> languages in the circuit complexity class
defined by circuits of polynomial size and  constant depth. This result
implies some very strong and deep results in complexity of boolean circuits
(like <i> PARITY <i> is not in <i> AC0). <i>

As a fellow from UNAM (my home university) I need to have a supervisor, mine
is <!WA5><a href=http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rajsbaum"> Dr Sergio Rajsbaum</a>, 
he has been in a long sabatical year at the MIT Laboratry for 
Computer Science. If you are interested in Distributed Computing, 
I would strongly recommend you to visit his home page. <br></br>

I will be attending from february the 25th to march the 2nd to the 
<em> McGill-Montreal Invitational Workshop on Complexity Theory, </em> this
event will be held at the McGill University's Bellairs Research Institute 
in Barbados. The core of the talks will be given by 
<!WA6><a href=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora> Prof Sanjeev Arora </a> 
from the <a href:http://www.cs.princeton.edu> Computer
Science Department </a> at Princeton University. If you are interested to
know about the Workshop's adacemic program <!WA7><a
href=http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~czamora/public_html/plan.jpg> Click here! </a>
There are many nice things to go to Barbados, one of them is that I will
be away from the Montreal's very, very, very, cold weather... <br></br>


As you may have noticed, I am a Simpsons TV show fan. If you don't watch
the Simpsons, you're missing one of the <b>best</b> programs in television.
Here there are some links that I have found interesting about it. <br></br>
