<H2>Research</H2>
<P>My research is on improving the performance of Large Scale Distributed
Simulations through Interest Management, aka data subscription, data
distribution management, or relevance filtering.  I've recently completed a
survey of previous work in the area.  Almost all of the work in this area
to date has been targeted at <!WA9><A HREF="http://www.sc.ist.ucf.edu/~STDS">
Distributed Interactive Simulation</A> (DIS) systems.  Most of the previous
implementations of Interest Management
have been fundamentally static.  My work attempts to make dynamic Interest
Management feasible using an autonomous objects paradigm.  I'll be using a
system called <!WA10><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~bic/messengers/messengers.html">
MESSENGERS</A> which is being developed by my advisor's research group, most
notably <!WA11><A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/dir/grad/CSD/mfukuda">Munehiro Fukuda</A>.

<H2>Employment</H2>
<P>When I'm not at UCI, I'm working to support my education habit, which
unfortunately takes up more of my time than I'd like.  But, hey, living in
Southern California isn't cheap.  I've been working in industry for over
10 years in the areas of simulation, compilers, operating systems, computer
security, neural networks, speech recognition, image processing, and
engineering process development.  I'm a senior computer scientist
at <!WA12><A HREF="http://www.saic.com">SAIC</A> currently supporting the 
<!WA13><A HREF="http://www.dmso.mil">Defense Modeling & Simulation Office's</A>
work in data distribution management for the
<!WA14><A HREF="http://www.dmso.mil/projects/hla">High Level Architecture</A>.
You will notice that this is conveniently related to my research at UCI.

<P>Support your right to free speech on the Internet.  The recently passed

<P>I'm a member of UCI's Women in Computer Science <!WA22><A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wics">(WICS)</A> group.  WICS gives female students and faculty in the department a forum for networking and discussing issues which are unique to our position in a traditionally male-dominated field.</P>

hopefully standing in the Pacific surf.</P>

<LI>No really, I'll be out of here in only two more years.
<LI>My job prospects look really good.
<LI>The department is giving me so much support.
<LI>I just have one more book to read and then I'll start writing.
<LI>I turned down a lot of great job offers to come here.
<LI>Your latest article was so inspiring.
<LI>I would never date an undergraduate.
<LI>My work has a lot of practical importance.
<LI>I'd be delighted to proofread your book/chapter/article.
<LI>It doesn't bother me at all that my college roommate is making $80,000
