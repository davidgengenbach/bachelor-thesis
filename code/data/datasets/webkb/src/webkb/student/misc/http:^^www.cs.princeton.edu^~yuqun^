<p>
I am currently on two-year sabbatical from my Ph.D. tenure at our famed Computer Science Department. But I do stay
at the same Old(en) place and have the same advisor (now boss) -- Professor 
<!WA0><A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~li">Kai Li</A>. 
<P>
My primary duty involves Princeton's
<!WA1><A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/sio">Scalable I/O Projects</A>, among
which I've been developing this deliverable software for the SIO/Intel
community -- a user-level checkpointing library, 
<!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~yuqun/checkpoint/libNXckpt.html">
LibNXckpt</A>, for <!WA3><A HREF="http://www.ssd.intel.com">Intel</A> Paragon
multi-computer. Please click and check it out. My duty also includes
some support work for Princeton's other SIO projects. In addtion, I do some work for
<!WA4><A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu">SHRIMP</A> projects. Last summer, I
wrote the Linux device driver for our SHRIMP hardware and later on helped
several people adding new features to it.
<P>
In the fall of 1997, I will come back to become a third-year graduate student.
All that's left is a thesis -- what all of us here sweat for five years for.
