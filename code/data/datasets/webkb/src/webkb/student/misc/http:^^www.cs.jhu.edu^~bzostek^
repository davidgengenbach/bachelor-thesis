<h1> Welcome to my home page!</h1>

Thank you for stopping by in your cruise of the ever-slowing "Information Superhighway".

<p>

As you can probably tell, this is just the first pass in my attempts to build
a homepage worthy of your time. I know I'm not there yet, but, as free time
permits < yeah right laugh >, I'll be exploring the intricacies of HTML.

<h2> So, who am I? </h2>

Well, I just started my second year as a Ph.D. student in the <!WA0><a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu"> 
Computer Science Department</a> at 
<!WA1><a href="http://www.jhu.edu">The Johns Hopkins University</a>.  I'm working
under <!WA2><a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~rht">Dr. Russel Taylor</a>, in 
<!WA3><a href="http://www.ius.cs.cmu.edu/mrcas/mmenu.html">Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery</a>.
<p>
This summer, I co-taught a data-structures with my roommate 
<!WA4><a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~weiss">Scott Weiss</a> and
some other random guy, 
<!WA5><a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~kobourov">Stephen Kobourov</a>. 

<p>

I graduated from <!WA6><a href="http://www.rice.edu">Rice University</a> in 1995,
with a degree in
 <!WA7><a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu">Computer Science</a> and
 <!WA8><a href="http://riceinfo.rice.edu/cogsci">Cognitive Sciences</a>.


During my stay at Rice, I was a proud member of 
<!WA9><a href="http://riceinfo.rice.edu/projects/colleges/jones/">Jones College</a> 
and a two time inhabitant of 
<!WA10><a href="http://www.rice.edu/~brandon/third.south.html">Third South</a>.
I also played in the <!WA11><a href="http://riceinfo.rice.edu/~lynette/MOB.html">MOB</a>.
<p>
I grew up in <!WA12><a href="http://198.215.16.7:443/fortworth/">Fort Worth</a>,
<!WA13><a href="http://www.texas.com/">Texas</a>, where I graduated from HSEP (which
now has <!WA14><a href="http://www.infophil.com/Texas/Alumni/HSEP/">an entry

on alumni.net</a>).
<p>
There's not much else to say, so thanks for stopping by, and good surfing!
