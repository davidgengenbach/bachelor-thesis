<HR><A NAME="whoisleo"></A><B><I>Who is Leo Selavo anyway ?</I></B> 
<HR>Presently I am a graduate student at the <!WA5><A HREF="http://www.cs.pitt.edu">Department
of Computer Science</A> at the <!WA6><A HREF="http://www.pitt.edu">University
of Pittsburgh</A>. <BR>
<BR>
I am a latvian. Born in <!WA7><A HREF="http://www.latnet.lv/">Latvia</A> (you
know, one of those there Baltic Republics), grown up there, now gone to
the United States to study.<BR>
<BR>
I got my Masters Degre in Computer Science at the <!WA8><A HREF="http://www.latnet.lv/LU/">University
of Latvia</A> in 1994. <BR>
<BR>
I used to work at the <!WA9><A HREF="http://www.latnet.lv/">University of Latvia</A>
as a lecturer. I was instructor for such classes as &quot;<B>Human-Computer
Interaction</B>&quot;, &quot;<B>Personal Computer Organization</B>&quot;
and &quot;<B>Seminar on Issues on Data Visualisation</B>&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Also I used to work at <!WA10><A HREF="http://www.swh.lv/eng/riti">RITI, the Riga
Information Technology Institute</A>. RITI is (was?) a subsidiary of the
<!WA11><A HREF="http://www.swh.lv/">SIS (SWH Informative Systems)</A> company
in Latvia. My work at RITI was linked to meta-model based CASE software
tool development.<BR>
