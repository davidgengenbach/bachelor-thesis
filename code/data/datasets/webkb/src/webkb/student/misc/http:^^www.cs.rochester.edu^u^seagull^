I've always thought these bios are lame, but then I realized: What else goes on a 
home page about me?
<P>
I got a degree in Math and CS from <!WA1><A HREF="http://www.upenn.edu">U.Penn </A> in 1995, 
then came here that fall.  I'm 
interested in Natural Language and Knowledge Representation, and I anticipate 
working on the <!WA2><A HREF="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/trains/">TRAINS project </A> over the next few years.
<P>
OK.  That's the briefest of the brief.  Here are some <!WA3><A HREF="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/seagull/links.html"> links </A> I've found interesting/useful.
<P>

<H3> CSC108 </H3>
I'm also TA'ing <!WA4><A HREF="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/courses/108/Fall-96/">CSC108 </A> this term.
For some helpful info and pointers (but beware of policies that are
specific to his lab), check out <!WA5><A HREF
="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/singhal/108/108home.html">Amit Singhal's 108 web page </A>.  Also
on line are <!WA6><A HREF="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/seagull/108grades.html"> grades for my Cooperative
Learning section </A> of 108, organized by the last 4 digits of your
Student ID number.  Note that you should refer to the <!WA7><A
HREF="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/courses/108/Fall-96/Cooperative/cooperative-intro.html">
grading policy </A> for the course first if you have any questions.
