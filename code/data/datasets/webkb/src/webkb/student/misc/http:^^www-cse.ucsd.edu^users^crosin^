For many problems, performance of candidate solutions needs to be measured
on a suite of test cases.  The choice of test cases can be an important factor
in the quality of solutions found.  <I>Adversarial problems</I> 
are those for which 
it is possible to search for good test cases as well as good solutions.
Examples include games (strategies must be tested against strong opponents),
controller design (test against difficult plants), and grammar induction
(test on strings that reveal unusual features of the language).  I am 
exploring theoretical aspects of adversarial problems, and heuristic methods
for solving them.
