Biography
</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

Since 1988 I have been engaged in several research and teaching 
activities. My special area of interest is Computer Networks, with 
emphasis to multimedia applications and high-speed communication 
systems with quality of service guarantees.
<P>
During the period of 1989 to 1990 I was granted four teaching 
assistantships at the Mathematics Institute of UFRJ.  The subjects 
of the courses were Computing I, Linear Algebra II, Infinitesimal 
Calculus III, and Differential and Integral Calculus II.
<P>
In the period of 1990 to 1991 I was awarded a first research 
assistantship from a Sponsored Brazilian Research Institute to work 
at the Mathematics Institute. This project was concerned with several 
Linear Algebra topics embracing the study of Algebraic Computation 
and making use of the C programming language and some mathematical 
software tools to implement several factorization technics for 
polynomials.  
<P>
In my undergraduate senior year (1991 to 1993) I was awarded a second 
research assistantship to work in two Audio projects at the Department 
of Electrical Engineering at UFRJ, concerning the study of the 
electronic sound synthesis. In the first project an electronic 
drum was developed. The second one consisted in the implementation 
of a digital voice recorder and player.  
<P>
In the middle of 1992, I took part in the Computer Network Research 
Group (GTA) at the Department of Electrical Engineering at COPPE/UFRJ.  
At This time I was involved in the study of the concepts of Computer 
Networks defined in the Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection, 
and also in the study and development of formal description techniques. 
My undergraduate project consisted in the implementation of an 
integrated environment for Petri Net analysis, including the development 
of a text editor, a compiler, an analyzer and an on-line help.
<P>
By 1993 I started to work in a system development company as a 
system analyst. During this period, I took part in the development 
of a satellite vehicle locating system.
<P>
By 1994 I started my M.Sc. course in the Department of Electrical 
Engineering at COPPE/UFRJ in the particular area of Computer Networks.  
the topic of my thesis was concerned with the study of 
Connection Admission Control (CAC) mechanisms for ATM networks such as 
Equivalent Capacity, Non-parametric aproach, Heavy-traffic approach,
Dynamic CAC, Hybrid CAC, etc.  
The main objectives were to analyze and to compare the 
performance of these mechanisms by means of simulation and analitical
analysis and to 
give support for an implementation in the real time communication 
system architecture developed by the GTA.  
<P>
By October 1996, I started my Ph.D. at the University of California 
at San Diego. My interest in realizing  a Ph.D. course is a 
consequence of the need of improvement of my academic and professional 
background.  As in Brazil there is an urgent need for qualified engineers 
to maintain the country updated with the state of art of the new 
technologies, the realization of this Doctorate Course will enrich my 
research in Computer Networks and will contribute for the improvement 
of our courses in the graduate and undergraduate levels.
