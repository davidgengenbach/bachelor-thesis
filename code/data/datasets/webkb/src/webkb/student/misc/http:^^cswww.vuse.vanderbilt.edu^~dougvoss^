Welcome!  For those of you who don't know me....  I am a
Ph.D. candidate in the <!WA1><a href="http://cswww.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/">
Department of Computer Science </a> at <!WA2><a
href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/"> Vanderbilt University </a>.  
<p>

My research focuses upon uncertainty in temporal databases.  My
dissertation, a work in progress, is titled: <em> Indeterminacy in
Temporal Databases </em>.  For more information about my work, you
might want to read over a <!WA3><a
href="ftp://csftp.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/tech_reports/TR96-01.ps">
technical report</a> (postscript) I wrote with my advisor <!WA4><a
href="http://www.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~pcf/"> Dr. Patrick
C. Fischer</a>; it presents some of the results which will appear in
my dissertation.  If you prefer, an ASCII version of the <!WA5><a
href="ftp://csftp.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/tech_reports/TR96-01.txt">abstract
</a> is also available.  If you check back in late February
you should find a pointer to the dissertation itself!
