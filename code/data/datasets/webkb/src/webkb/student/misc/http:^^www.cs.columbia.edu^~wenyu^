<TITLE>Wenyu's Home Page </TITLE>

<H1>Welcome to my homepage.</H1>

I am a second-year Ph.D. student working for <!WA0><A HREF="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kaiser">Prof. Gail Kaiser</A>. I spent my first two years at <!WA1><A HREF="http://stimpy.weeg.uiowa.edu/shanghai.html">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</A> in the <!WA2><A HREF="http://www.aimhi.com/VC/sjtutr/"> TR Class </A>, then I transferred to <!WA3><A HREF="http://cse.bridgeport.edu">University of Bridgeport</A>, where I just got my B.S. degree. I am also currently a member of <!WA4><A HREF="httP://mville.edu:8000/jafar/upe/">UPE (Upsilon Pi Epsilon) in Connecticut Delta Chapter</A>.

Here is a <!WA5><A HREF="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~wenyu/wenyu.gif"> picture </A>I took recently.

<DT> I am TAing the continuous algorithms course W4241 this semester, if
you are taking the course, you can visit <!WA6><A HREF="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~wenyu/TA/W4241/">the
course homepage </A>.

<DT> Here is some useful (and hopefully interesting) homepages I have
found on the Internet. If you are looking for help on various Unix
tools, like Latex, Emacs, Lex/Yacc, this may be a place to <!WA7><A
HREF="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~wenyu/help.html"> go </A>.



<P> My homepage is still under construction, so any good advice is welcome. </P>
