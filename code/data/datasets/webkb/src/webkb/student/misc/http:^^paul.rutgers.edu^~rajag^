About me and what I do here <p>

<blockquote>

Born in <!WA7><a href=http://www.webindia.com>India</a> in the post-indepedence era, I spent most of my younger days in Madurai, the temple city, in the state of <!WA8><a href="http://www.cs.umbc.edu/~arul/tamil.html">Tamil Nadu</a>. The country is famous for its <!WA9><a href=http://www.evansville.edu/~wcweb/wc101/inpage.htm>historic</a> values. If you plan to visit, here's a <!WA10><a href =http://www.solutions.mb.ca/rec-travel/asia/india/india-guide.html>guide</a> to plan your trip. And don't forget to travel by <!WA11><a href=http://www.pbs.org/natlgeo/qa.html>Indian Railways</a>. They are the oldest and the best railways in the world.
<p>
After graduating in Production Engineering from Regional Engineering College, Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, South India and working for an Engineering Company in Bombay, the financial capital of India, I decided to go back to school for graduate study. So, I flew to this great land of oppurtunity, the United States of America, to further enhance my knowledge and skills.
 <p>
That was 4 years ago. My present status: still in school at Rutgers working towards my Masters in Computer Science. 
<p>
So, what did I achieve in four years, then? A Masters in Industrial and Systems Engineering from this same University in Oct'94 (Here's the <!WA12><a href="http://paul.rutgers.edu/~rajag/grad.html
">proof</a> of my graduation). Isn't that enough?

My first friends in the US<p>

<blockquote>

Being new to this country with a totally different culture it was really hard to make any friends. It was a year later when I met <!WA13><a href="http://paul.rutgers.edu/~rajag/friends.html">Mr. Brian Hall and Ms. Catherine Todd Boyles </a>, my first good friends at Rutgers.
<p>
Brian is with the Sociology department. He is a veteran at Rutgers, where he did his undergraduate and graduate degrees and is now in his doctoral program. He (like me!) never wants to leave school. Spends so much time helping other people that he hardly gets time to work on his doctoral program. Enjoys teaching and presently teaches in the English department. He is a very good tour guide and showed me around <!WA14><a href="http://paul.rutgers.edu/~rajag/friends1.html" align = center>Philadelphia</a> and New York City. Thanks Brian!  
<p>
Cathy graduated in May'95. She hails from Pittsburgh, the home of the famous Hindu temple. She is very interested in foreign languages. Though not a German, she graduated with a Masters from the German department at Rutgers and specialized in translation. Her interests include studying languages, poetry, reading, sewing and of late, playing tennis. She is all excited about her new full-time job as a translator at <!WA15><a href=http://www.siemens.com>Siemens</a> and her upcoming marriage to Mark Klingler.  Mark is a great artist at <!WA16><a href=http://www.clpgh.org/CMNH/home.html>Carnegie Museum </a>. Good Luck, Cathy!
