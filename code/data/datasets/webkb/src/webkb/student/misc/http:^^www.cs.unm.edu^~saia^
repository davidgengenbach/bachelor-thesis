This is the home page of Jared Saia.  I study Theoretical Computer Science.
Most people have no idea what this is which I think is a result of the
fact that Computer Science has not entered popular culture in the same
way that say Physics has by inundating the science section of every book
store with books linking Physics and Tai Chi and the like.

In order to explain some of the interesting results and research going
on in theoretical CS to the layperson, I'm writing a small paper
which can be found <!WA0><A HREF="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~saia/mono.html"> here</A>.

Sorry there are no references to Eastern Philosophies in it.
