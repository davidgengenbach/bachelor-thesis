Nemecio R. Chavez, Jr.

Master of Science student in Computer Science.

Current Work
</H3>
Right now, I'm just taking courses and trying to finish up with my degree.

Interests
</H3>
I like to do a wide assortment of things.  But, I have to admit that most of my time is spent playing guitar or listening to music.  Outside of that, I like to hike, mountain bike, watch or play basketball, and write.
