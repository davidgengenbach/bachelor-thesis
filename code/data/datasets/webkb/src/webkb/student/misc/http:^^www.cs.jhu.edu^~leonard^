<h2> Research Interests </h2>

<dl>
<dt> Concurrency Theory
<dd> Most of my research has been in testing theory for real-time systems.
More recently I have been working on testing equivalences for Pict, a 
concurrent object-oriented language based on the pi-calculus. 
<dt> Model-checking for Real-time and Probabilistic Systems
<dd> 
<dt> Scheduling Theory
<dd> While this is not something I am actively studying as part of my thesis
research, 
I did spend the summer of 1996 working at <!WA0><a href="http://www.rl.af.mil:8001/">Rome Laboratory</a> doing research in this area.

<h2> Personal: </h2>
This seems to be the section where everyone mentions the far-away places 
that they call home. Well 
I'm a native Baltimorean so obviously I didn't stray too far from home
when I chose JHU. I actually grew up in Linthicum (12 miles to the south,
where the airport is).
My high school, <!WA1><a href="http://www.wam.umd.edu/~pdo/ashsframe.htm">Archbishop Spalding H.S.</a>, has its own homepage.
I managed to get a little farther away from home for college.
I graduated in 1991 from <!WA2><a href="http://www.rmc.edu">Randolph-Macon College</a> in Ashland, Virginia with a degree in
<!WA3><a href="http://www.rmc.edu:80/academic/departments/csci">Computer Science</a>
and <!WA4><a href="http://www.rmc.edu:80/academic/departments/math">Mathematics</a>.
