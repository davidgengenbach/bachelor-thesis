<h2>Darryle Merlette's Home Page</h2>
<h4>
Hello there!
<p>
My name is 
Darryle Merlette and I am a PhD
student in <!WA1><a href="http://athos.rutgers.edu/">Computer Science
at Rutgers University</a>. 
My research interests are in
<EM>Artificial Intelligence</EM> because I feel there is too much
<EM>Natural Stupidity</EM> in the world! 
You can find out about the
<!WA2><A HREF="http://riches.rutgers.edu:8001/~orost/cs541/">
Stock Market Data Mining Project
</A>
that I worked on (Fall 1994) if you wish, but I can't guarantee
the sanity, consistency, or recency of the links and data. More recently I've 
been working on the compression of DNA sequence data and
connectionist natural language generation (can you tell
I'm undecided about where exactly to focus my research?).
Ahhh, the joys of infinite search space!
<p>
I have a B.S.E in Computer Science from
<!WA3><a href="http://www.princeton.edu/"> Princeton University</a>
and a M.S.E in Computer Science and Engineering from the
<!WA4><a href="http://www.umich.edu/"> University of Michigan</a>.
<p>
I've spent 6 years as a Software Engineer at
<!WA5><a href="http://www.bellcore.com/">Bell Communications Research
(Bellcore)</a> and am currently a Software Development Consultant
with Advanced Information Solutions.
