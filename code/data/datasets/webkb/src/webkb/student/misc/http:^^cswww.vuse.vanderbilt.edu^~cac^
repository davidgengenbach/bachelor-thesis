<BODY>
I am a Ph.D. student
in the <!WA0><A HREF="http://cswww.vuse.vanderbilt.edu">
Computer Science Department</a> at  
<!WA1><A HREF="http://www.vanderbilt.edu"> Vanderbilt University</a>,
Nashville, Tennessee.
My advisor is 
<!WA2><A HREF="http://www.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~dowdy/home.html">
Dr. Larry Dowdy</a>, and I am a member of the Performance 
Evaluation Group
<!WA3><A HREF ="http://cswww.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~peg">
(PEG)</a> which works in conjunction with 
Oak Ridge National Lab 
<!WA4><A HREF ="http://www.ccs.ornl.gov">(ORNL)</a> on the early evaluation
of systems.
I received a B.S. degree in computer science
from the
<!WA5><A HREF ="http://www.utk.edu"> 
University of Tennessee at Knoxville </A>  in
1988.
I completed my M.S. degree in computer science 
in 1994 here at Vanderbilt University.
From 1988 until 1994 I was employed at the IBM Software
Solutions Laboratory at Westlake in Roanoke, Texas.
I am currently working on my Ph.D. at IBM's 
<!WA6><A HREF="http://w3.watson.ibm.com"> T. J. Watson Research Center </A>
in Yorktown Heights, NY.
I expect to complete my Ph.D. in December 1996.


<p>
My research interests include performance modeling and prediction, 
computer architecture,
parallel and distributed systems, and parallel I/O.
My dissertation topic is in the area of parallel I/O
workload characterization and the optimization of
RAID performance.
I am also working on performance supplement textbooks and their
solutions sets: 
<EM> P.S. to Operating Systems</EM>,
<EM> Solutions to P.S. to Operating Systems</EM> (both available from Prentice
Hall), and
<EM> P. S. to Computer Architecture</EM> (coming soon), jointly
sponsored by CMG and ACM/SIGMETRICS.
I have contributed to an 
<!WA7><A  HREF = "http://cswww.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~peg/publications/exp_log/exp_log.ps"> 
experimental log</a> of the PEG's work 
on the Intel Paragon XP/S at ORNL.

<p> 
About myself, I am an avid reader, everything from Nobel prize
winners to romance novels.
I enjoy exercising: running, swimming, biking, basketball, and more.
I love traveling and have spent time in Holland, Ireland, France,
Italy, Lebanon, and the Netherland Antilles.
I like to cook (and eat); I hate to clean.
I have a cat and a husband.
<p>
Life is short. <dd>
Work hard. <dd>
Play hard. <dd>
Love a lot. <dd>
Get plenty of rest and eat your vegetables. <dd>
