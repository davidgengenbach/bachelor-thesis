About me, my dreams, and my opinions...
</CENTER>
</H2>

<P>
I am a 1st year graduate student at <!WA5><A href="http://www.tulane.edu/">Tulane University</A>
.  I just received my double major in <!WA6><A href="http://www.eecs.tulane.edu/">Computer Science</A>
and <!WA7><A href="http://www.math.tulane.edu/">Mathematics</A> and
plan to receive a <!WA8><A href="http://www.cs.tulane.edu/www/EECS/ms-requirements.html">Masters degree in Computer Science</A>
in May of '97. My main area of interest and expertise is PC software.
I'm particularly interested PC operating systems, mass market desktop applications, and 
development tools. I try to follow industry news closely and
enjoy discussing the week's news with knowledgeable people. My
main hobby outside of school is tweaking and upgrading my computer
at home. After a few years of upgrading, I finally have my dream
machine assembled. If you're interested, you can check out the specs.
<P>
When I graduate, I would like to work for a major software house
developing software for Windows NT/Windows 95,97.... I want to
work at least a few years with a small team of super programmers
in a dungeon with ragged T-shirts, sipping Coke, wearing puffy
bear-claw slippers with my feet up on a desk, and working 100 hour
weeks just to get our software out on time. After that, I would
like to move up the ladder to project manager and oversee the
development of a major product from start to finish and be proud
that I was an integral part in its success. That's my dream....

<P>
There are basically two things that I dislike in the computer
industry: <!WA9><A href="http://www.eecs.tulane.edu/www/Ellington.Bryan/os2.html">Macs and OS/2</A>.
I am the first to admit that I am very opinionated. I have found
that both Macintosh and OS/2 advocates (OS/2 people more so) tend
to be very vocal in the defense of their platform. If you like
debating or would just like to send me your opinion on why someone
should use OS/2 or a Macintosh instead of Windows 95/NT, fill
out my <!WA10><A href="http://www.eecs.tulane.edu/www/Ellington.Bryan/os2.html">OS/ 2 &amp; Macintosh Form</A>
and click send or <!WA11><A href='mailto:ellingto@eecs.tulane.edu">send me mail</A> directly.
<P>
If you are having problems with your PC, <!WA12><A href="mailto:ellingto@cs.tulane.edu">drop me a note</A>
and I'll try to help. Please, no Mac or OS/2 problems. :-) <BR>

Visit <!WA17><A HREF="http://www.eecs.tulane.edu/www/Ellington.Bryan/billg.html">Bill Gates</A>
and Co. and catch up on the future of computing at the <!WA18><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft Home Page</A>.
Microsoft updates their server about once a week and overhauls
the look of things about once every 2 months or so. At about 2 million hits/day, it really
is one of the best sites on the web for both general and technical
product information.<BR>
<BR>
I have given up using Netscape.  In my opinion (I know I have a lot of them), IE3 kills Netscape.  I never 
liked downloading 7-8 betas anyway.  If IE3 is a superset of Navigator, why use Netscape?  IE4 will make 
this whole Netscape vs. Microsoft fight moot.  Netscape will have to fight to hold its markets in UNIX, 
OS/2 (HA!), and the new hand-held web market Netscape wants to create.  IE3 dominance in Winodws and Mac 
(let's see...that's about 95% of the total market) is just a matter of time for Microsoft.
<P>
Check out this document <!WA19><A href="http://www.eecs.tulane.edu/www/Ellington.Bryan/msft.html">About Microsoft Corporation </A>for

<BR>
Want the latest on <!WA20><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows">Windows 95</A>?
<P>
I always try to support Microsoft in any way I can. I have been
studying Windows 95 for about three years now (I've been using it
since March 23, 1995), so if you have any questions regarding
Windows 95, please don't hesitate to <!WA21><A HREF="http://www.eecs.tulane.edu/www/Ellington.Bryan/comment.html">ask</A>.
Windows 95 is an outstanding product has easily lived up to the
hype. Windows 95 has, by any measure, changed the shape of the entire industry
and introduce new innovations such as MPEG and 3D to the masses.
Although not quite as uncrashable as Windows NT, Windows 95 is
a quantum leap above Windows 3.xx. So, if you are thinking about
buying OS/2, think again. Ask yourself who is developing for Warp
and who is developing for Windows 95. EVERY SINGLE major PC software
publisher has been porting their apps to Windows 95 over the past
two-three years. OS/2 Warp has one or two big guys that have Win95 AND Warp
plans. Why switch to OS/2? I can't see why... 
<P>
It's too bad IBM can't do anything significant with OS/2; Windows
95 has no real competition now. An argument could be made for
OS/2 over Windows 3.xx, but Windows 95 eliminates all of OS/2's
advantages over 16 bit Windows. Don't be fooled by the very vocal
OS/2 crowd; Windows 95 is a great product that destroyed any
need for OS/2 Warp except for that cult of OS/2 Internet buffs
that think Microsoft is the root of all evil. If you doubt me,
check out some of the flaming OS war messages on <!WA22><A HREF="news:comp.os.os2.advocacy">comp.os.os2.advocacy</A> or
the CANOPUS forum on CompuServe and see for yourself.<BR>

<H2>Delphi</H2>

<P>
When a product is good, I always give it due credit. (OS/2 just
sucks, so it gets no credit). <!WA31><A HREF="http://www.borland.com/Product/Lang/Delphi/Delphi.html">Delphi</A>
is what <!WA32><A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/vbasic">Microsoft Visual Basic</A>
should have been. It is an extremely easy to use, powerful RAD
environment. What really differentiates it from Visual Basic and
PowerBuilder is that is is completely object-oriented (based on
Object Pascal) and <B>compiled</B> not interpreted. This means
it is very easy to compile and distribute without worrying about
distributing runtime DLLs. There is also a significant speed advantage
of compiled programs over interpreted ones. I've written several
Delphi applications and I am still amazed at the power and ease
of use Delphi offers. I have been using Delphi exclusively for my development 
of applications at work and I love it.

Up until a few months ago, Netscape was leading the way in the support of new HTML 3.0 features
such as page backgrounds, tables, and floating images.  Then, all of a sudden Microsoft Internet 
Explorer 2.0 came on the scene.  With support for in-line video, watermarks, background sounds, and more, 
Microsoft challenged Netscape for the leadership position in Web browsing.  Netscape was still ahead of Microsoft
in some areas such as frames and plug-ins, but when <!WA57><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">Internet Explorer 3.0</A> 
came out, Microsoft finally matched or surpassed Netscape in every category.  Now, IE3 is a superset of Navigator 
in every way except multiplatform support.  So what if the 5% of non Windows/Mac machines out there don't run IE.

Not to digress again, but I do think IBM had a real oportunity
with the PowerPC systems they were preparing. Of course, they screwed things up again. 
They can't even get OS/2 to work well enough to even release it for the PowerPC. Pathetic. 
They should stick to hardware and stay out of the OS business.  I think the ThinkPad group at IBM should run the whole company.
They seem to be the only ones capable of making a real product that people want.

Apple has gone down the tubes quickly.  Apple fans are really amazing.  They don't realize that people don't
buy Macs because they are slow, expensive, cyclops-mouse, loser machines that happen to be easy to use.  Instead, they
waste all their time throwing the blame all over companies like Microsoft that are so good at what they do that
everyone they beat gets jealous and cries foul.  People buy PCs and Windows because they <b>like</b> it.  They don't buy Macs because
