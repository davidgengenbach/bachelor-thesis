Hello and welcome to the corner of this vast web I call home.
I know it's fairly meager, but consider it a work in progress.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>A short history</H2>
<UL>
<LI> B.A. received May, 1995 from <!WA1><A HREF =
"http://www.hamilton.edu/">Hamilton College</A>
<LI> Intern at the <!WA2><A HREF = "http://www.mcs.anl.gov/">MCS Division</A>
of Argonne National Laboratory
</UL>

<P>
As an undergraduate at Hamilton, a small liberal arts college in upstate
New York, I majored in Computer Science and minored in Physics, however,
I also studied a wide variety of other, more diverse topics as well.
<P>
I spent two Summers at the Math and Computer Science Division of Argonne
National Laboratory as a member of the Futures Lab.  Specifically I helped
construct, and maintain the CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment.  The 
<!WA3><A HREF = "http://www.mcs.anl.gov/FUTURES_LAB/VR/cavelab.html">CAVE</A>
is an immersive, multiple user, virtual environment that was featured at
SIGGRAPH 94.  Most recently I was involved with the further development and
improvement of the user tracking software.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>What I'm doing now</H2>
Currently I am a second year PhD student working in the Robotics group under
Peter Allen.  I am presently buried in books to study for a qualifier, but
when I do have time for research it includes:
<UL>
  <LI> Real-time vision tracking systems for grasping.
  <LI> Intelligent trackers.
  <LI> Tactile sensing.
  <LI> Applying the above to our Barrett Hand.
</UL>
<P>
My other interests (when I actually have a free moment) include swimming, 
camping in the Adirondacks, skiing, karate, going to Yankee Games, and enjoying
good microbrews.
<P>
Perhaps you'd like to see some <!WA4><A HREF = "http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~amiller/photos.html">photos</a> from Turkey or Mt. Katahdin in Maine.
