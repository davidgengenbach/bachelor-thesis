<strong>"First, some introductions."</strong><p>
I am a Ph.D. candidate in 
the <!WA4><A HREF="http://cswww.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/">
Computer Science Department </A> at <!WA5><A HREF= "http://www.vanderbilt.edu">
Vanderbilt University</A>.  My area of research is Artificial Intelligence and
my focus is knowledge based expert systems.  The working title of my dissertation is
<!WA6><a href="http://www.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~biswas/ResearchPages/diagnosis.html#SyndromicClustering">
<em> Syndromic Abstraction:  A method of exploiting domain structure to focus abductive reasoning
in association based representations </em></a>.  This research is being conducted under the direction 
of <!WA7><a href="http://www.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~biswas/homepage.html"> Dr. Gautam Biswas </a> <p>

I also hold an MS degree in computer science from Vanderbilt University, a BS
degree in computer science from the <!WA8><a href="http://www.math.scarolina.edu/"> 
University of South Carolina</a>, and a BS degree in
nursing from Indiana State University.  The title of my MS paper is <em> A Qualitative
Model of Electrocardiac Physiology </em> (Tech. Report CS-90-14, Vanderbilt University).
A more complete description of my background including a publication list can be found
on my <!WA9><a href="http://cswww.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~weinberg/Vita.html"> vita</a>. <p>

In addition to the above academic accomplishments, I have been been involved in research
funded by Amoco Oil Company and Arco Oil Company.  This work investigated methods of
applying inductive machine learning techniques to the task of database mining.  Also I have
over 6 years of clinical nursing experience, the majority of which is in Emergency Nursing.<p>

Upon completing my Ph.D. degree I have interests in 
<!WA10><a href="http://cswww.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~weinberg/teach.html"> teaching</a> and
combining my two areas of knowledge (clinical nursing and computer science) by 
joining a research group involved in Biomedical Informatics. If you are interested
in exploiting my experience and enthusiasm in either or both of these pursuits
collect my <!WA11><a href="http://cswww.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~weinberg/Vita.html"> vita</a>,
send me email at <em>weinberg@vuse.vanderbilt.edu</em>, do not pass GO, do not collect $200.
