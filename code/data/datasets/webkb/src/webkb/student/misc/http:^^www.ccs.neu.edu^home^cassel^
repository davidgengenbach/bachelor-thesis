<H1>Welcome to David Cassel's home page!</H1>

<P>I am a graduate student here at Northeastern University, in the
College of Computer Science.  Very soon, I'll be graduating with a
Master's degree, and moving back to the <!WA0><a
href="http://www.phillynews.com">Philadelphia</a> area.

<P>When I graduate, I'll be going to work for <!WA1><a
href="http://www.lockheed.com">Lockheed Martin</a> in Valley Forge, PA
as a Software Engineer.

<P>By some miracle, I have finished everything!  I'm done!  I'm no
longer a student, but somehow I've managed to find ways to fill my
time.  I can deal with this.  

<P>How about some <!WA2><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cassel/stuff.html">miscelaneous fun stuff.</a>
