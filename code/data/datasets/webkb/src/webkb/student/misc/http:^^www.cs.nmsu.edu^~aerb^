Originally I am from <!WA0><A
HREF="http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~aerb/vaih.html">Vaihingen/Enz,
Germany</A>. I spent my undergraduate years in Tallahassee, Florida
and Chadron, Nebraska. In August 1995 after my graduation I moved to Las
 Cruces to start graduate school. After my graduation here I want to move
back to Germany and start working or get into a doctoral program in
computer architecture. While I was back in Germany this summer I
visited the Computer Science department of the Friedrich Schiller Universitaet in Jena. Check out their
<!WA1><A HREF="http://isun04.inf.uni-jena.de">Institute for Computer
Architecture and Communication</A>. This site is in German only.

<p>People often ask me why I actually
went to the US to attend college. I really don't have a logical
explanation for this, I just know that it has been a dream of mine
since I was a little child. When I was four years old I told my mother
that one day I would live in the US for a while. So, here I am.

I really like cats a lot. I have two at home. Do you want to see some
pictures of my two <!WA2><A
HREF="http://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~aerb/cats.html">monsters</A> (link does
not exist yet)? The larger one of the two is called Dim Sum. He is the
older one and has been with me for about three years.
The smaller one - Sogo - is his best friend. She is about eighteen
months old and the wild one of the two. Always ready for a
chase down the hall or other games, she is also the one who has enough
energy at 4 am to wake me up and demand breakfast.
Besides playing with my cats, I like reading a lot, I am an active
member of Amnesty International and enjoy dancing or just hanging out
with friends.

My best friend in the world is <!WA3><A
HREF="http://www.freenet.tlh.fl.us/~thomasr">Rob Thomas</A>. We became
friends during my undergrad year at FAMU. Since then he's been by my
side through thick and thin.
