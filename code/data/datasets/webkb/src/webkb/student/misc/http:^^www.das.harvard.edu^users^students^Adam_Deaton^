<h2> projects & interests</h2>
<p> My current interests are in parallel algorithms and programming, 
theory of computation, and graphics and visualization.  These are some
projects I've worked on recently:

<td>  This picture (from a CT scan of a lobster) was rendered using 8 Sun
workstations, a modified version of Phil Lacroute's <!WA3><a
href="http://www-graphics.stanford.edu/software/volpack/">VolPack</a> software, and the <!WA4><a
href="http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/oxpara/bsplib1.htm">Oxford BSP library</a> (Thanks to <!WA5><a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jmd">
John Danskin </A> for the data.)

<tr> <td> <!WA6><a href="http://www.geom.umn.edu/~deaton/cgi-bin/start.cgi">
<!WA7><img src="http://www.das.harvard.edu/users/students/Adam_Deaton/frog.gif" width = 150></a> <td> Recently, I worked on a
project with Rocco Servedio involving human correlation-detection
ability.  We have a <!WA8><a href="http://www.das.harvard.edu/users/students/Adam_Deaton/animal-paper.ps.Z"> paper</a> describing
the results of our experiment.  Try our experiment over the web! Start
by clicking on the frog at left.  (The first page may take a while to
load.)

<tr> <td> <!WA9><a href="http://www.das.harvard.edu/users/students/Adam_Deaton/brain-labeled.tiff"> <!WA10><img src="http://www.das.harvard.edu/users/students/Adam_Deaton/brain-small.gif" width = 150></a> 
<td> This is
an image made up of 80 MR scans of a human brain.  I took the
data from the <!WA11><a href="http://www.med.harvard.edu/AANLIB/home.html"> Whole
Brain Atlas</a>.

<p> The colors show a labelling of the brain into four possible
materials (unknown voxels are transparent).  The algorithm involved
stochastically optimizing this classification using the Swendsen-Wang
algorithm (originally developed for simulations in statistical
mechanics.)  It took a long time. This was part of a final project for
<!WA12><a href= "http://www.das.harvard.edu/cs/academics/courses.html">
Computer Vision</a>.  <!WA13><a href="http://www.das.harvard.edu/users/students/Adam_Deaton/brain-paper.ps.Z"> This </a> is a paper
describing my project.

<td> Another project involving volume rendering: I wrote a simple
volume renderer as a <!WA18><a href=
"http://www.das.harvard.edu/cs/academics/courses.html"> Computer
Graphics </a> final project.  These two images are frames from short
video sequences.  Click on them for the animations.  (Thanks to
Professor <!WA19><a href=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpd> David Dobkin</a>
for letting me use Princeton's RealityEngine to make these.)  The CT
data are classified into three materials: bone (white), fat (greenish),
and soft tissue (orange).  The first animation shows bone rendered 70%
opaque, fat 50% opaque, and soft tissue 40% opaque.  In the second,
first soft tissue, and then fat are rendered gradually more
transparent, leaving only bone.  See ``Volume Rendering'', by Drebin,
et al in <i>SIGGRAPH '88</i> for more details of the rendering
algorithm.

<p> I wrote a program called lafite
for exploring the symmetries of 2-dimensional hyperbolic isometry
groups.  It has a limited interactive WWW front-end which you can try
by clicking on the picture at left.  This <!WA24><a href="http://www.das.harvard.edu/users/students/Adam_Deaton/thesis.ps.Z">
paper</a> (500K, compressed PS) contains some background about lafite
and the mathematics behind it.  The full version of lafite runs only
on SGI's, the source is available <!WA25><a
href="ftp://ftp.geom.umn.edu/priv/deaton/lafite.tar.Z">here</a>.
(Apologies for the out-of-date documentation.)

<td> I also wrote some code for the environmental artist Agnes Denes.
Her current project ``<!WA28><a href="http://nttad.com/asci/ad.html">Tree
Mountain</a>'' involves planting 10,000 trees on a sculpted man-made
mountain in the Pinsio gravel pits, Ylojarvi, Finland.  This picture
shows a version of the pattern with only about 1,700 trees.  This
project was work with Professor John Conway and Tim Hsu at the
Princeton <!WA29><a href="http://www.math.princeton.edu"> mathematics
department</a>.  </table>
