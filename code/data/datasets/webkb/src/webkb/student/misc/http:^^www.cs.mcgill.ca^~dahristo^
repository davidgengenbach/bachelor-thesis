<H2><!WA2><IMG SRC="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/public_gifs/critic.ques.gif" ALT="o"> My study and research </H2>

I am a MSc student in Computer Science. It is already
my second year and a lot of things are behind me. Reading, programming,
presentations, few exams, TA hours. Graduate studies are taking a lot
of time and energy but there is a lot of excitment and challenge. Follow
<!WA3><a HREF=http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dahristo/prj_des.html> this link
to see </a>  more details about my research , what I have done and
what I am doing now (if interested at all). <P>

Interested in computer communication? Is INTERNET going to change our
society and make it a global village? I am interested so much that
I decided to devote my professional life to it. Make it faster, more
efficent, more managable, make it open. Interconnect it, control it 
(and collect the payment of course). I am doing my thesis in the area
of ATM and protocol testing. If this looks odd have a <!WA4><a HREF=http://
www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dahristo/prj_des.html> glance here. This 
work is ongoing </a> and it will last (I hope) untill early 1997 when I
plan to graduate. It looks endless but of course it is not.<P>   

You need <!WA5><a HREF = "http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dahristo/resume.ps">my  resume, pick it up from her. </a> I am trying to keep it updated as
much as possible, things are happening really fast.<P>
