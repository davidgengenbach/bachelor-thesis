<H2>Academic Interests</H2> 
<LI> I am interested in Machine Learning
techiniques especially inductive learning, using prototypes to represent
concepts, classification, and clustering.  

<P>

<LI> Currently I am applying machine learning systems to medical
databases, more specifically an Alzheimer's database.  We want to use
machine learning to increase the accuracy of patient screening tests.

<P>

<H2>Other Interests</H2>

Some activities I enjoy: hiking, backpacking, aerobics, vollyball,
cooking. I like cats too.
