<H3> Research Interests </H3>

I'm interested in Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC),
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and
Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW).

<H3> Publications </H3>
<LI> Pazzani, Michael, Muramatsu, Jack and Billsus, Daniel. "SysKill and Webert :
Identifying Interesting Web Sites". Proceedings of the  National Conference on
Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-96), August 1996, pp 54 - 61.




<H3> Computing  Skills / Interests </H3>
I'm a semi-competent <!WA4><a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a> programmer and also know just enough  about Web 
servers and CGI scripts  to get myself into trouble.  I've got a fair amount ofexperience with writing regular expression  for Web/Internet related
applications.   
<P>
If you're looking for a quick example of what can be done
with Perl in terms of the Web and HTML take a look at the HTMLized versions
of the <!WA5><A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLList.html">Machine Learning 
List Archives</A>.  The HTML versions you find on that archive were automaticallly created on-the-fly from the formatted ascii digests without any additional
human effort - completely seamless.  I should say although I'm happy with
the program, the strict format already in place for the ML digest made the job
<I>much</I> easier.
<P>


<H4> Colleagues</H4>

There are some great people here in the department and I've been lucky enough
to meet a few. Grad school can be a struggle at times - these people have
made the experience enjoyable and productive for me.<BR>

<!WA6><A HREF ="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dmcdonal">David McDonald</A> is my officemate, fellow group member, and co-conspirator ;-). He's also a great programmer - I'm always trying to learn a thing or two or three from him.  <!WA7><A href = "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lutters">Wayne Lutters</A> is also in our group and is currently studying
dial-up electronic bulletin boards. <BR>

<!WA8><A HREF= "http://www.ics.uci.edu/~palen"> Leysia Palen </A> is a fellow
UCSD CogSci Grad and a great person to be around. She always manages to cut
to the heart of the matter in a humorous way. Her current work focuses on the adoption and use of electronic calendering systems.  Finally, <!WA9><A HREF ="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sshukla">Shilpa Shukla</A> is always in high spirits and helps
me to keep things in perspective - no matter how stressful things get.  She's
interested in computer-support for collaborative learning (CSCL).
