<h1>Matthew R. Canaday</h1>
<h2>PhD Student</h2>
<h3>Tulane University, New Orleans, LA</h3>
<p>My current work is focussed almost exclusively on my dissertation.</p>  
<p>I am researching
and constructing a neurally plausible model of the human visual motion perception system.  
It encorporates several different fields, from my undergraduate work in physiological psychology, 
my work at NYU's Department of Physiology and Biophysics, and my computer science work 
here at <!WA2><a href="http://www.tulane.edu/index.html">Tulane</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps this needs a little more explanation:</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>Neurally Plausible</i></dt>
<dd>The model is based on research in physiology and <!WA3><a href="http://www.cs.tulane.edu/www/Canaday/citation.html">theories</a> of early vision.</dd>
<dt><i>Human Visual Motion</i></dt>
<dd>This model has as its motivation the exploration of theories of human psychophysics, primarily
the phenomenon of equiluminant motion perception.</dd>
<dt><i>Perception</i></dt>
<dd>Perception, a opposed to detection, poses an intriguing question of the interactions between
receptors in early vision and the assignment of meaning at later stages in the human visual system.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Obviously, there is a whole lot more to it...</p>
<hr>
<p>but now for something completely different!</p>
