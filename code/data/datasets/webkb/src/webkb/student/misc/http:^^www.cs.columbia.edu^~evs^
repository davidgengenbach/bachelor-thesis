<P> I am a graduate student in the <!WA2><A  HREF="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/">
Computer Science Department  </A>at <!WA3><A
HREF="http://www.cc.columbia.edu/">Columbia University </A> in <!WA4><A
HREF="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/nyc/"> New York City </A>.  I am doing a
thesis on <!WA5><a href = "http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~radev/nlp"> natural
language processing </a>  with Kathleen R. McKeown.  My other major
interest is genetic algorithms, so I use them for natural language.<p>

I maintain a <!WA6><a
href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~evs/gpsym95.html">Genetic
Programming Brainstorming Archive</a> created by the participants of
the AAAI Symposium on Genetic Programming, Fall 1995.<p>

Also, here are my opinions on <!WA7><a href =
"http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~evs/GPIntrosHowTo.html">How To Write a Paper
for GP</a>.

<p> My homepage is lame, but my friend <!WA8><a
href="http://www.stinky.com/alex/">Alex Chaffee</a> says everything else I want
to say about genetic programming and stuff, and Lars likes it anyway.<p>

You can <!WA9><a href="mailto:evs@cs.columbia.edu">send me email</a>.


<P> "Wow, this is some kind of genetic algorithm!" says Kelly Lynch in
"Virtuousity," starring Denzel Washington.
