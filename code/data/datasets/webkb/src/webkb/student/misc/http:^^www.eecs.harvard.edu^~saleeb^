Hello. As you may know, I am a PhD student in <!WA3><a href="http://www.deas.harvard.edu/cs.grafx.html">Computer Science </a> at <!WA4><a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University </a> (one of the <!WA5><a href="http://www-net.com/univ/list/ivy.html"> Ivy League</a>). So far, it has been a lot of fun. Before this, I worked at <!WA6><a href="http://www.digital.com">Digital </a> on distributed management and internet related products. For a little while I was part of the 'real world' which was after being a student in <!WA7><a href="http://www-eecs.mit.edu/">Electrical Engineering and Computer 
Science</a> at <!WA8><a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT.</a> I spent many years at the Institute; getting my Masters in '95. Once i finish all this schooling, I would like to go to the <!WA9><a href="http://www.webcom.com/~rngerber/naturist/usa/CA/ca.html">beaches</a> of <!WA10><a href="http://www.ca.gov/">California </a> for a long while, learn how to surf, become a beach bum and work on a tan. You may call me a dreamer but i think i have a goal in life. 
<P> 
My academic and research interests include computer <!WA11><a href="http://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/bySubject/Networking.html">networking</a>, <!WA12><a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~arch/www/">parallel computer architectures </a>,  <!WA13><a href="http://www.cwi.nl/cwi/departments/AA1/distcom/distcom.html">distributed computing </a>, <!WA14><a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/bridges/oses.html"> operating systems </a> and the <!WA15><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/Cobwebs/BigDummy/bdg_toc.html">internet</a>. I guess i cover the computer systems area but touching <!WA16><a href="http://www.software.net/index.htm/SK:ockpkceclkacdaei">software</a> and communication along the ways. I look at myself as a tall thin engineer because i attempt to learn as much as possible about as many topics as i can humanly do without killing myself. But I am very interested in <!WA17><a href="http://www-net.com/univ/list/business.html"> management </a> and <!WA18><a href="http://www.barrons.com/">business</a>. In the future, i see myself combining both roles of an engineer and a manager. But, we shall see about that. 
<P>
Outside of school, i am engaged in various activities. I participate in many graduate teams at <!WA19><a href="http://dudleyhouse.student.harvard.edu/">Dudley House</a> including soccer, ultimate and volleyball. I am also a non-resident tutor at <!WA20><a href="http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~leverett/">Leverett House</a> which is one of the undergraduate dorms. I am an active participant at <!WA21><a href="http://pharos.bu.edu/CN/public/boston/Home.html">St. Mark's </a>. When i have a chance, i ride my bike along the <!WA22><a href="http://www.baylytech.com/charles/intromap.html#Map">Charles River</a> in <!WA23><a href="http://ftp.std.com/NE/boston.html">Boston</a>, read a <!WA24><a href="http://www.newslink.org/">newspaper</a> or even watch some <!WA25><a href="http://tvnet.com/index.html"> television</a>.
<p>
I love to <!WA26><a href="http://city.net/"> travel </a>. I have been to the west coast, midwest and all over the
east coast. By far, my favorite place is <!WA27><a href = "http://www.iag.net/~lsiddons/sanfran.html"> San Francisco</a>. The weather is just unbelievable. I hope to be able to travel to many more parts of the US and actually start on <!WA28><a href="http://www.telepac.pt/whatson/"> Europe</a>. 
<P>
So where did I grow up? I am from a town in the suburbs of <!WA29><a href = "http://www.totalny.com/"> New York City </a> called New Rochelle. It was named for the French Hugenot immigrants who came from La Rochelle. 
<P>
Other than that, I enjoy <!WA30><a href="http://207.67.226.112/soccernet/index.html"> soccer </a>, <!WA31><a href="http://www2.monaco.mc/imd/gallery/"> art </a>, <!WA32><a href="http://www.billboard-online.com/">music </a>, <!WA33><a href="http://www.tennisw.com/"> tennis </a> and <!WA34><a href="http://www.bookwire.com/PW/bsl/bestseller-index.html"> reading</a>.
