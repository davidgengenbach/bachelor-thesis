<p>
Hello!  I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the <!WA2><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/">
College of Computer Science</a> (CCS) at 
<!WA3><a href="http://www.neu.edu"> Northeastern University</a>.  
Currently I am working with <!WA4><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/fell">Prof. Harriet Fell</a> and 
 <!WA5><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/vkp">Prof. Vierra Proulx</a>, and I'm 
currently a member of the <!WA6><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/deltah/papers.html">
BBB</a> team. My main interests include but are not limited to Computers and 
Education, Classroom Research and development of multimedia systems.

<p> 
I was born and raised in Thessaloniki, Greece where I acquired my Bachelor 
degree in Mathematics. In Greece I worked for four years as a private 
tutor. At <!WA7><a href="http://www.neu.edu"> NU</a> I was briefly a tutor at 
the Math Center as well as a proctor at the Unix and Mac Labs of 
<!WA8><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/"> CCS</a>. 
I also worked as a full time research assistant at the Biological 
Knowledge Laboratory. I am very involved with life at the 
<!WA9><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/"> CCS</a>. I have already served as 
GROK chairperson for more than a year and as GROK vice-president for 
an additional year. Currently I am the <!WA10><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/"> 
CCS's</a> representative at the Graduate Student Association.
