<h1>Professional</h1>

<p>
The digigraph above was taken at the 1994 <!WA18><a
href="http://www.rsna.org/">RSNA</a> conference held every year in
Chicago the week after Thanksgiving. At that conference I presented
Mountain View, CA based Acuson Corporation's Aegis-DICOM Gateway which I
helped develop and clinically test.
</p>

<p>
Aegis is Acuson's Ultrasound mini-PACS system, and DICOM, DIgital
COmmunication for Medicine, is an industry-wide standard for the
exchange and storage of medical images.
</p>

<p>
For several years before that, I worked for Cemax, Inc., a Fremont, CA
based medical imaging multi-modality review station company. I was one
of the principal engineers of their 5010 product, a Sunview-based
software product that took as input two-dimensional modality data
(e.g. CT, MRI, US), segmented it, and produced as output <!WA19><a
href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~ead/skull-renderings.jpg">raytraced three-dimensional renderings</a>
for surgical planning. I was the designer and author of the 5010
product's image segmentation toolset.

</p>

<h1>Personal</h1>

<p>
My non-academic interests include, in no particular order, <!WA22><a
href="http://www.culturewave.com/culturewave/ba-bookstore-events/">literature,</a>
hiking (check out <!WA23><a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~ead/ead-arches.html">page 46 of the October
1994</a> Issue of <cite>National Geographic</cite> for another photo of
me), backpacking, bicycle touring (I've crossed North Carolina, bicycled
several days along the Pacific Coast Highway, bicycled several days
along the Blue Ridge Parkway, and crossed the country along the
BikeCentennial trail in 1985), canoeing (100 miles of mosquitos and
scorpions in the Florida Everglades), and ultimate frisbee. I can also
<!WA24><a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~ead/ead-juggling.html">juggle</a> and I enjoy <!WA25><a
href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~ead/csvolleyball.html">volleyball</a>.
</p>

<p>
Not to mention listening to folk music, new age music like <!WA26><a
href="http://www.windham.com"><cite>Windham Hill</cite></a>, blues, <!WA27><a
href="http://kksf.tbo.com/">jazz</a>, and classical (Glenn Gould is my
current favorite pianist). Finally, I really like <!WA28><a
href="http://www.gu.edu.au/gwis/cinemedia/CineMedia.DIR.html">film-going.</a>
My fast-food movie favorites include <!WA29><a
href="http://sarah.rsip.lsu.edu/star.trek.html"><cite>Star
Trek</cite></a> and martial arts films. My fine-dining film favorites
are foreign and art films. Check out <!WA30><a
href="http://www.elmail.co.uk/movie/pulp/taratext.html">Tarantino's</a>
<!WA31><a href="http://www.elmail.co.uk/movie/pulp/contents.html"><cite>Pulp
Fiction,</cite></a> Robert Altman's <cite>Short Cuts,</cite> or
<cite>Thirty-two Short Films About Glenn Gould</cite> if you haven't
already seen them.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I enjoy meeting people from different cultures. (And sampling
their <!WA32><a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~ead/spam.html">cuisine.</a> Especially Japanese and Korean
cuisine.) I've been interested in Japanese culture and philosophy for
several years, and am considering taking the plunge and learning the
language. I would call myself a student of Zen Buddhism, but I don't
practice.
</p>

<p>
While I'm currently living with upper-middle-class white Anglo-Saxon
males between the ages of 18 and 34, my friends and roommates of the
past have hailed from China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico,
Romania, Spain, Switzerland, and Vietnam. Not to mention upstate New
York.
</p>

<p>
Late-breaking bulletin: I've just learned that roommate #1 can speak
Norwegian and that he was actually born in Norway. He's shown me the
canned reindeer meatballs in the cupboard to prove it. Also, roommate #2
spent a year in Japan and speaks some Japanese. So I guess that,
culturally, my roommates are <i>not</i> strictly Anglo-Saxon.
