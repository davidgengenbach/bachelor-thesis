<p> If you came here trying to reach Jayendran Rajamony's home page, you
    need to go <!WA1><a href="http://micmac.gso.uri.edu/rajamony"> here</a>. Well,
    go visit him anyway - he's my brother

<p> I am a 4th year graduate student at <!WA3><a href="http://www.rice.edu"> Rice 
    University</a>, working towards my doctorate in Computer Engineering. My
    thesis work is on the performance debugging of shared-memory parallel
    programs; <!WA4><a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~alc"> Alan Cox</a> is my thesis
    advisor.

<p> Here's a little bit about myself. I have a Bachelor of Technology degree
    in Electrical Engineering from the
    <!WA5><a href="http://sol.rutgers.edu/~sabesan/iitm.html"> Indian Institute of
    Technology, Madras</a>.
    Two years of work at <!WA6><a href="http://www.ncsu.edu"> North Carolina State
    University</a> earned me a Master's degree in Computer Engineering. Since
    then, I've been at Rice. From August 1996, I am being supported by an 
    <!WA7><a href="http://www.ibm.com"> IBM</a> corporate fellowship.

<h1>Research Work</h1>
I have been involved in various research projects at Rice. Here are some of
the interesting projects I am working on.

<ul>
<li> <!WA8><a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~willy/TreadMarks/overview.html">
     TreadMarks</a> - software distributed shared memory for parallel computers.

<p><li> My dissertation work is on developing a <i>source-level</i> performance 
    debugging approach for improving the performance of parallel programs.

    <!WA9><a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~rrk/perfdebug.html">

    here</a> for more information.

<p><li> I am also interested in looking at compiler strategies for improving
    the performance of shared-memory systems. Specifically, I have explored
    methods to reduce the coherence traffic in shared-memory systems by
    compiler intervention.

<p><li> I have also worked on the Rice Parallel Processing
    Testbed (RPPT) project. This project has created a unified
    architecture, interconnection network and memory hierarchy simulator. Neat
    stuff, contact <!WA10><a href="http://www-ece.rice.edu/~jrj"> Prof. Jump</a> in
    the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department for more information on
    this.
