  groupware, CSCW, telecommuting
<P>
  I am looking at communication among software development
  teams who work in distributed groups.
  The distribution of the group may include working in
  separate offices as well as working part-time from home.
  Communication within the group is by telephone, shared
  work space and files, as well as email and face-to-face.
  Telecommuting can be defined as working at a distance
  and using telecommunications technology to do that
  job.  Telecommuting may take place from home or from
  another office.  I am also interested in how workers
  set up their office space while telecommuting.
