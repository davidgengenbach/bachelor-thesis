They are playing a game. They are playing at not playing a game. <BR>
If I show them I see they are, 
	I shall break the rules and they will punish me. <BR>
I must play their game, of not seeing I see the game. --R. D. Laing

Let me have my own way, <BR>
Let others promulge the laws, I will make no account of the laws, <BR>
Let others praise eminent men and hold up peace, 
		I hold up agitation and conflict, <BR>
I praise no eminent man, I rebuke to his face the one that was thought most
		worthy. <BR>

I realized that I was plagiarized 136 years ago by W. Whitman.
