I'm a graduate student in the <!WA1><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/">
Northeastern University</a> <!WA2><a
href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/">College of Computer Science</a>.<P>

<!WA3><A HREF="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/finger?lpb">Finger</A> me to see what's up. <P>

I am maintaining the <!WA4><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lpb/muddex.html">MUDdex</a>
for people who are interested in the history and future of multi-user
internet games.<P>

Here are some obligatory <!WA5><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lpb/links.html">cool links</a>
to play with when you should be working.
<p>
Here are some things that have nothing to do with computers:<P>
<ul>
<li><!WA6><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lpb/jewelry.jpg">Jewelry.</a>

<li>An <!WA7><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lpb/anti-valentine.html">anti-valentine</a>.

<li>Here is an actual excerpt from a paper I wrote for a Religions of
China class at Wesleyan University in Spring of 1989 on <!WA8><a
href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lpb/grade-pressure.html">Buddhism</a>.  Don't take it too
seriously.

<li>A short essay on <!WA9><a
href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lpb/relationsh-eq.html">relationships.</a>  And C.
Written in early 1993 when things weren't going so well.  Includes
numerous obscenities. 

<li>Have some <!WA10><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lpb/quotes.html">quotes.</a>  What corner
of cyberspace is complete without them?

<li>On Wednesday, April 13, I will be installing the tattoo I've been
meaning to get for a year.  Click to see the <!WA11><a
href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lpb/tat-before.JPG">original art.</a>  Here is a somewhat
blury photo taken in The Pit at Cullinane of the <!WA12><a
href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lpb/lauren.jpg">tattoo itself</a> the day after.  Note
that it's reversed left-to-right from the original.  Here's a somewhat
disjointed <!WA13><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lpb/ink">account</a> of the experience.

<li>A <!WA14><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lpb/interstate">poem.</a>

<li>Just to be heretical, an <!WA15><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lpb/thomas.html">apocryphon</a>.
