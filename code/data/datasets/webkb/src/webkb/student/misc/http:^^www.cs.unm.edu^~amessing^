<h1>Adam's Homepage</h1>


Hi, I'm a graduate student here in the Department of Computer Science
at the University of New Mexico.  I'm working for <!WA1><a
href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~ackley/">Dave Ackley</a> as an R.A.  I could tell you what I
was working on, but then I would have to kill you.  Haven't really had
time to work on a homepage as much as I would have liked.  You can
however get my <!WA2><a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amessing/resume.html">resume (CV)</a>.  You might prefer the
<!WA3><a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amessing/resume.ps">PostScript version</a> if you plan on printing it.  <br><br><br>

<p>

<!WA4><IMG  WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=126 SRC="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amessing/gif/SFILogo-trans.gif" align = right alt =
"Santa Fe Institute Logo"> <h3>Academic Interests</h3>

Generally I am interested in computers and how they can make my life
better.  That interest takes a lot of different forms.  I like HCI,
new approaches to computation and techniques to describe them.  I am
also interesting in using computer modelling as a tool to better
understand the natural world, especially if this understanding can in
turn be leveraged to build better computer systems.  In this vein I
worked at <!WA5><A href="http://www.santafe.edu/">The Santa Fe Institute</A>
last year where I worked on evolving Cellular Automata (you can look
at my <!WA6><a href="http://www.santafe.edu/~amessing/">homepage</a> there
to see what I was up to.)


<p> <!WA7><IMG  WIDTH=117 HEIGHT=121 SRC="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amessing/gif/lightning_fist.gif" align = left
alt = "Cyber Rights Now"> <h3>Politics <!WA8><a href ="http://www.eff.org/blueribbon.html"><!WA9><IMG  WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=30 SRC = "http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amessing/gif/blue-rib.gif"></a>
<!WA10><a href ="http://www.privacy.org/ipc/"><!WA11><IMG  WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=30 SRC = "http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amessing/gif/gold-key.gif"></a> </h3>

I am really quite concerned with the recent <!WA12><a
href="http://www.yahoo.com/Government/Politics/Censorship/Censorship_and_the_Net/">censorship</a>
activities, such as the Telecommunications Reform Bill, on the <!WA13><a
href="http://www.eff.org/pub/Alerts/index.html#exon">'net</a> and <!WA14><a
href="http://bronze.ucs.indiana.edu/~quinnjf/censor.html">writ
large</a>.  I also try to keep track of a few other issues, most
importantly to me are <!WA15><a
href="http://www.yahoo.com/Government/Law/Privacy/">privacy</a> and
other <!WA16><a
href="http://www.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/Civil_Rights/">civil
liberties</a>, especially <!WA17><a
href="http://www.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Organizations/Public_Interest_Groups/Electronic_Freedom/">electronic
freedom</a>.  In addition I believe that the Drug War and the <!WA18><a
href="gopher://gopher.well.sf.ca.us/00/Politics/piss.list">hiring
practices</a> which accompany is a threat to civil rights.

<p>

I am a member of the <!WA19><a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier
Foundation</a> and the <!WA20><a href="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil
Liberties Union</a> as well as the <!WA21><a
href="http://www.acm.org/">Association for Computing Machinery</a>.  I
also support the <!WA22><a href="http://www.privacy.org/ipc/">Internet Privacy
Coalition</a>, the <!WA23><a href="http://www.lpf.org/">League for Programming
Freedom</a>, the <!WA24><a href="http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~trent/gnu/">Free
Software Foundation/GNU</a>, and the <!WA25><a
href="http://www.hks.net/cpunks/">cypherpunk</a> ideal. <p>


<!WA26><a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amessing/photo/photoCD/adam-climbing-ouray.jpg"><!WA27><IMG  HEIGHT=150 WIDTH=150 SRC="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amessing/photo/photoCD/adam-climbing-ouray-small.jpg" align =
right alt = "Ice Climbing in Ouray"></a><h3>Recreation</h3>

I enjoy most outdoor activities, especially [rock, ice, mountain] <!WA28><a
href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amessing/climb/index.html">climbing</a> and <!WA29><a
href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amessing/photo/photo.html">taking pictures thereof</a>.  I have always
lived quite near the wilderness and plan on moving back if this whole
global village, telecommuting thing comes true.  Heck, these days even
the <!WA30><a href="http://www.gorp.com/aac/aachome.htm">American Alpine
Club</a> and the <!WA31><a href
="http://www.sportsite.com/accessfund/">Access Fund</a> are online.  I
just joined both this year.

<p>

I have a fondness for <!WA32><a
href="http://www.teleport.com/~dgs1300/brewpubs.html#OrBpubs">nice
beer</a>.  In particular I find Bridgeport Special (only availiable at
their brewpub that I know of) and Pintail ESB, Full Sail Pilsner,
Widmer Hefeweizen and Sierra Nevada Porter to be very pleasing.  While
I think that their quality control has slipped in recent years I also
enjoy an occasional Ruby from the McMenamins (I would recommend the
smaller places that still brew their own beer on site.); how I miss
the Pacific Northwest.  Fundamentaly I guess I am just another typical
West-coast, high-quality-of-life, slacker.

<p>

<H3>Travel</H3>

I am planning to take a <!WA33><a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amessing/travel/trip.html">trip</a> to<!WA34><a
href="http://sunsite.nus.sg/asiasvc.html" > South-East Asia</a>, <!WA35><a
href="http://www.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/New_Zealand/" >New
Zealand</a>, and <!WA36><a
href="http://www.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/Australia/"
>Australia</a> within the next year.  I spent some of my formative
years in New Zealand, so I am really looking forward to visting.  Any
advice/reccomendations appreciated.

<DT><H3>Web Resources</H3> Despite my rather
feeble web page, I really do think that the WWW is a useful tool.  If
I had more time, I might make more use of these tools and resources.

<p>

Uh, if you are interested you can get my <!WA43><a
href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amessing/bookmarks.html/">current
bookmarks</a>.  I know that's kind of lame, just throwing those all
out there without comments and all, sorry 'bout that.  You can also
take a peek at my <!WA44><a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~amessing/news/">Gnus Adaptive Scoring Files</a> if
you like.  I think that these are examples of nice simple ways that
people can share knowledge.
