<h3>People</h3>
I feel very lucky in my life that know some wonderful people.  
Unfortunately none of them come to mind right now.  Anyhow, here are
<!WA1><a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~dsmith/people-to-know.html">some losers</a>
who I don't actually know, and who I would not really want to be associated
with, but well, check it out.  Maybe.

I am a PhD student in 
<!WA6><a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/">The University of New Mexico Computer Science
Department</a> and I also work at <!WA7><a href="http://www.santafe.edu/">

I am researching the immune response to viruses that mutate.

<h3>Other Interests</h3>
I enjoy photography.  I recently
took a super photo class in the art dept here at UNM.  
My prof was Rod Lazorik who was tremendous.  Here are some tips about 
<!WA13><a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~dsmith/photo-processing-and-supplies-in-abq.html"> 
Photo Processing and Supplies in Albuquerque</a>.
<p>
I'm also keen on motor racing, I used to do a bit, but these days, as
a student again, I just get to watch.  I follow Formula One pretty closely.
I get race practice and qual times from 
<!WA14><A HREF="http://www.monaco.mc/f1/"> Gale Force</a>, testing times 
and news snippets from 
<!WA15><A HREF="http://www2.monaco.mc/atlas/news/index.html"> Atlas</a>
and newspaper reports from 
<!WA16><A HREF="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et/access?ac=112181244306&pg=//motorace.html"> 
The Electronic Telegraph</a>
I also enjoy reading the British magazine 
<!WA17><A href="http://w3.gti.net/ewacars/mghas.html"> Autosport.</a>
<p>
I'm pretty keen on human rights too.  I am a full supporter of the
<!WA18><A HREF="http://www.aclu.org/index.html"> ACLU</a>.  It was a delightful
revelation to me when I learnt that Liberty and Democracy, phrases
which to me were synonyms at one time, are the opposite of each other.
Liberty being the right of the minority to do what it wishes, and Democracy the
right of the majority to decide for everyone.  Talking about rights, 
did you know that
<!WA19><A HREF="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~dsmith/turing.html"> Alan Turing was found guilty of being homosexual</a>.
His punishment was to take huge doses of estrogen.
He grew breasts.  I'm not shitting you.  And it is probably why he
comitted suicide.

<h3>Other Lives</h3>
For ten years I worked at Texas Instruments, mostly in corporate 
research.  I had a blast at TI.  I met some great folk and worked
on fun stuff.  I always had one eye on Computer Aided Design of
Integrated Circuits, and with the other,
spent time hacking Genetic Algorithms and Pentti Kanerva's 
beautiful Sparse Distributed Memory neural network.  TI was a really 
good place to work for me, I learnt a ton, and feel I gave a ton
too.  Around 1991 I saw the movie 
<!WA20><a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~atreides/Terminator/welcome.html">
Terminator 2</a>,
and was struck with
horror when the neural net hacker cracked consciousness and his
invention was immediately snarfed by the military.  I was thinking 
about consciousness at the time and I identified with this dude.
I can't believe my life was changed by an "Arnie" movie, but I 
justify it by saying that the thoughts were brewing anyhow.  
(It used to be that one's 
<!WA21><a href="http://www.acs.oakland.edu/~grossman/erdoshp.html">
Erd&ouml;s number</a> 
was important, but
one has to have a low 
<!WA22><a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~bct7m/arnie.html">
Arnie-number</a>
too.)
So I decided that I wanted to work on something that would have a
chance of benefiting humanity somewhat more directly, and a year
later I was doing a PhD in theoretical immunology.
