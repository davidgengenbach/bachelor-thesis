<P> I am a Graduate student in Computer Science at the California
Institute of Technology.  Having just moved to Pasadena, I'm still
becoming re-accustomed to sunny weather. I recently worked in the
midwest as a consultant to the Multimedia/Internet Division at Sprint.
There I was a project lead and co-architect of the division's
infrastructure.  I finally found the time to get some <!WA0><A
HREF="http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~kiniry/creative/images.html">pictures</A> online.  See some betrothal
pictures and two houses; one I live in and one we ate!
