<h2> RSC - the World's Biggest Waste Of Time</h2>
What, you may well ask, is RSC?  RSC is none other than the world famous,
incomparable <!WA8><a href="news://news/rec.sport.cricket">rec.sport.cricket</a>,
a forum for the most in-depth and enlightening discussion on the ins and outs
of cricket.  In other words, if you want to observe a bunch of Indians,
Pakistanis and Sri Lankans, a sprinkling of people from Down Under, an 
odd Englishman
or two, a lonely West Indian and the random South African argue passionately
about <em> whether it is being pedantic to require a team to show up for
a match when they know their opponents are not going to show up </em> and
other such earth shatterring issues, then
indeed this is the very place to be.

Since I have had a good time working for CrossAccess especially this summer
I am going to put in a gratituous plug for them.  Check out their web
page at <!WA9><a href="http://www.crossaccess.com">www.crossaccess.com</a> to 
see what they are all about.
